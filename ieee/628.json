In the first phase, we show that network coding based on decode-and-forward relaying can be generalized to arbitrary input cardinality through proposed lattice code-aided linear precoding, despite the fact that precoding is permitted only at the BS due to non-cooperation among the MSs. In addition, a new sum-rate lower bound for the second phase is derived by showing that the two spatial decoding orders at the BS and MSs for one-sided zero-forcing dirty-paper-coding must be identical. From the fundamental gain of network coding, our sum-rate lower bound achieves the full multiplexing gain regardless of the number of antennas at the BS or RS, and strictly exceeds the previous lower bound which is based on traditional multiuser decoding in the first phase. Furthermore, it is shown that our lower bound asymptotically achieves the sum-rate upper bound in the presence of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymmetry in high SNR regime, and sufficient conditions for this SNR asymmetry are drawn.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","startPage":"1304","endPage":"1318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Sum-Rate of MU-MIMO Cellular Two-Way Relay Channels: Lattice Code-Aided Linear Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Sum-Rate of MU-MIMO Cellular Two-Way Relay Channels: Lattice Code-Aided Linear Precoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933541","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable Sum-Rate of MU-MIMO Cellular Two-Way Relay Channels: Lattice Code-Aided Linear Precoding","sourcePdf":"1304jsac0812yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119103S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280240,"authors":[{"name":"Lennart Gerdes","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280240/6280240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lennart Gerdes (S'10) received his B.Sc. and diploma degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2008 and 2009, respectively, both from the Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM), Germany.

A general outer bound on the rate regions that can be achieved in the restricted two-way MIMO relay channel is established, and we present an achievable rate region based on the decode-and-forward scheme which is a superset of several previously derived achievable rate regions.

For maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a destination node, we derive an analytical solution and the maximum achievable SNR when there is an individual power constraint for each relay. Based on the derived results, a greedy algorithm is proposed to sequentially find beamforming weights. It is shown that the complexity is linear to the number of relays per iteration, and the number of iterations is less than or equal to the number of relays.

Research on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been actively pursued for achieving channel throughput improvements for cellular networks.

At source node, THP is adopted to mitigate the spatial intersymbol interference. However, due to its nonlinear nature, THP is very sensitive to channel estimation errors. In order to reduce the effects of channel estimation errors, a joint Bayesian robust design of THP at source, linear forwarding matrices at relays and linear equalizer at destination is proposed. With novel applications of elegant characteristics of multiplicative convexity and matrix-monotone functions, the optimal structure of the nonlinear transceiver is first derived. Based on the derived structure, the transceiver design problem reduces to a much simpler one with only scalar variables which can be efficiently solved. Finally, the performance advantage of the proposed robust design over non-robust design is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transceiver with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transceiver with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933546","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280244/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transceiver with Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"1370jsac0812xing.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135046S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280245,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Ho Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280245/6280245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seong-Ho Park (S'11) received the B.Sc. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering in 2007 and the M.S. degree in the Telecommunication System Technology in 2010 from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

First, we provide a new design strategy for optimizing the relay amplifying matrix. Instead of conventional optimal design approaches resorting to an iterative gradient method, we propose a near optimal closed-form solution which provides an insight. As relay systems with a direct link incur a non-convex problem in general, we exploit the decomposable property of the error covariance matrix and a relaxation technique imposing a structural constraint on the problem. Next, we study the error performance limit of the proposed scheme using diversity-multiplexing tradeoff analysis, which leads to several interesting observations on MMSE-based cooperative relaying systems. Finally, through numerical simulations, we confirm that the proposed solution shows the performance very close to the optimum with much reduced complexity and the analysis closely matches with simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE-Based MIMO Cooperative Relaying Systems: Closed-Form Designs and Outage Behavior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-Based MIMO Cooperative Relaying Systems: Closed-Form Designs and Outage Behavior","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933548","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-Based MIMO Cooperative Relaying Systems: Closed-Form Designs and Outage Behavior","sourcePdf":"1390jsac0812song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183707S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280247,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280247/6280247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Institute of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

Assuming channel state information is not available at the source and relay, the optimal transmit and receive beamforming vectors are computed at the destination, and the transmit beamforming vector is sent to the transmitter via a dedicated feedback link. Then, a set of new closed-form expressions for the statistical properties of the maximum eigenvalue of the resultant channel is derived, i.e., the cumulative density function (cdf), probability density function (pdf) and general moments, as well as the first order asymptotic expansion and asymptotic large dimension approximations. These analytical expressions are then applied to study three important performance metrics of the system, i.e., outage probability, average symbol error rate and ergodic capacity. In addition, more detailed treatments are provided for some important special cases, e.g., when the number of antennas at one of the nodes is one or large, simple and insightful expressions for the key parameters such as diversity order and array gain of the system are derived. With the analytical results, the joint impact of source, relay and destination antenna numbers on the system performance is addressed, and the performance of optimal beamforming schemes and orthogonal space-time block-coding (OSTBC) schemes are compared. Results reveal that the number of antennas at the relay has a great impact on how the numbers of antennas at the source and destination contribute to the system performance, and optimal beamforming not only achieves the same maximum diversity order as OSTBC, but also provides significant power gains over OSTBC.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Single Stream Beamforming in MIMO Dual-Hop AF Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Single Stream Beamforming in MIMO Dual-Hop AF Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933550","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280248/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Single Stream Beamforming in MIMO Dual-Hop AF Systems","sourcePdf":"1415jsac0812zhong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102585S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280249,"authors":[{"name":"Yindi Jing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280249/6280249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yindi Jing received the B.

For the end-to-end channel estimation, instead of directly estimating entries of the channel matrix, we use singular value decomposition (SVD) and estimate its largest singular value and singular vectors, which are then combined to form an estimation of the channel matrix. An approximate maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation is proposed, which is shown to become the exact ML estimation when the time duration of each training step equals the number of antennas at the transmitter. Simulation on the mean square error (MSE) shows that the SVD-based approximate ML estimation performs about the same as the exact ML estimation and is superior to entry-based estimations. For the individual channel estimation, we decompose each channel vector into the product of its length and direction, and find the ML estimation of each. By using an approximation on the probability density function (PDF) of the observations during training, an analytical ML estimation is derived.

Compared with cascade channel estimations, its performance is superior for the relay-receiver channel estimation and comparable for the transmitter-relay channel estimation.

This paper studies the scenario of K stations and a MIMO switch, which has full channel state information. The precoder at the MIMO switch is either a zero-forcing matrix or a network-coding matrix. With the zero-forcing precoder, each destination station receives only its desired signal with enhanced noise but no interference. With the network-coding precoder, each station receives not only its desired signal and noise, but possibly also self-interference, which can be canceled. Precoder design for optimizing the received signal-to-noise ratios at the destinations is investigated. For zero-forcing relaying, the problem is solved in closed form in the two-user case, whereas in the case of more users, efficient algorithms are proposed and shown to be close to what can be achieved by extensive random search. For network-coded relaying, we present efficient iterative algorithms that can boost the throughput further.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless MIMO Switching with Zero Forcing and Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless MIMO Switching with Zero Forcing and Network Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933553","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280251/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless MIMO Switching with Zero Forcing and Network Coding","sourcePdf":"1452jsac0812wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074913S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280252,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Xia","affiliation":["Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280252/6280252-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minghua Xia (M'12) obtained his Ph.D. degree in Telecommunications and Information Systems from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007.

Moreover, for ease of mathematical tractability, channels considered in such studies are generally assumed to be subject to Rayleigh fading or to be Nakagami-m channels with integer fading parameters, which is impractical in typical urban environments. In this paper, we propose a unified moments-based framework for general performance analysis of channel-state-information (CSI) assisted amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems. The framework is applicable to both one-way and two-way relaying over arbitrary Nakagami-m fading channels, and it includes previously reported results as special cases. Specifically, the mathematical framework is firstly developed under the umbrella of the weighted harmonic mean of two Gamma-distributed variables in conjunction with the theory of Pad\u00e9 approximants. Then, general expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratios of the users in one-way/two-way relaying systems and the corresponding moments, moment generation function, and cumulative density function are established. Subsequently, the mathematical framework is applied to analyze, compare, and gain insights into system performance of one-way and two-way relaying techniques, in terms of outage probability, average symbol error probability, and achievable data rate.

The performance of these selection strategies is quantified by deriving the overall outage probability, its high SNR approximation and the diversity order providing valuable insights into practical system-designs. Importantly, multiple relay and multiple user two-way relay network set-ups are also treated by proposing and analyzing (i) joint relay and antenna selection strategies, and (ii) joint user, relay and antenna selection strategies, respectively. Interestingly, our outage probability results reveal that the joint relay and antenna selection strategies achieve significant diversity and array gains over those of their single relay counterparts. In fact, the diversity orders of individual relayed-branches accumulate to yield the overall diversity of the multi-relay networks.

The advantage of shared relaying is that the joint processing of signals at the relay enables the mitigation of intercell interference. To maximize the benefit of shared relaying, the resource allocation and the scheduling of users among adjacent cell sectors need to be optimized jointly. Based on this motivation, this paper formulates a network utility maximization problem for the shared relay system that considers the practical wireless backhaul constraint of matching the relay-to-user rate demand with the base-station-to-relay rate supply using a set of pricing variables. In addition, zero-forcing beamforming is used at the shared relay to separate users spatially; multiple users are scheduled in the frequency domain to maximize frequency reuse. A heuristic but efficient scheduling and resource allocation algorithm is proposed accordingly. System-level simulations quantify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and show that the incorporation of the shared relay can improve the overall network performance and in particular significantly increase the throughput of cell edge users as compared to separate relaying.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280257/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933559","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fair Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Wireless Cellular Network with Shared Relays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Wireless Cellular Network with Shared Relays","sourcePdf":"1530jsac0812lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089225S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6280258,"authors":[{"name":"Brian P.

The principal difficulty in implementing such a system is that, due to the limited attenuation between the relay's transmit and receive antenna arrays, the relay's outgoing signal may overwhelm its limited-dynamic-range input circuitry, making it difficult-if not impossible-to recover the desired incoming signal. While explicitly modeling transmitter/receiver dynamic-range limitations and channel estimation error, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the end-to-end achievable rate of decode-and-forward-based full-duplex MIMO relay systems, and propose a transmission scheme based on maximization of the lower bound. The maximization requires us to (numerically) solve a nonconvex optimization problem, for which we detail a novel approach based on bisection search and gradient projection. To gain insights into system design tradeoffs, we also derive an analytic approximation to the achievable rate and numerically demonstrate its accuracy. We then study the behavior of the achievable rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, interference-to-noise ratio, transmitter/receiver dynamic range, number of antennas, and training length, using optimized half-duplex signaling as a baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","volume":"30","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12933560","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280258/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex MIMO Relaying: Achievable Rates Under Limited Dynamic Range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex MIMO Relaying: Achievable Rates Under Limited Dynamic Range","sourcePdf":"1541jsac0812day.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099055S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6280259,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungsik Ju","affiliation":["University of Singapore, Singapore","Department of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280259/6280259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyungsik Ju (S'08, M'll) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

It is assumed that channel state information is not available at transmitters and beamforming is employed as the transmission scheme. A closed-form expression is developed for hop success probability in networks of this type. The delay and throughput of multi-hop networks employing full duplex and half duplex beamforming are than compared. The delay and throughput are studied in two cases: when full duplexity is used for full duplex relay (FDR), and bi-directional beamforming (BBF). For FDR, employing full duplex beamforming is more beneficial if a low rate constraint is required or if interferers are rare. However, this benefit diminishes as the required data rate or the interferer density increases. For BBF, the use of full duplex beamforming is always more beneficial because it leads to a reduction in the required rate constraint. Specifically, this benefit becomes more significant as the required rate rises and interferers become rarer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280259.pdf","startPage":"1554","endPage":"1565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Duplexity in Beamforming-Based Multi-Hop Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Spread spectrum communication","Array signal processing","Delay","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","delays","probability","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full duplexity beamforming","beamforming-based multihop relay networks","interference-limited multihop networks","channel state information","transmitters","closed-form expression","transmission scheme","hop success probability","half duplex beamforming","delay","full duplex relay","bidirectional beamforming","BBF","FDR","low rate constraint","wireless multihop relay networks","interferer density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-hop","full duplex relay","beamforming","delay","throughput","success probability","rate constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Full Duplexity in Beamforming-Based Multi-Hop Relay Networks","volume":"30","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6280259/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933561","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Duplexity in Beamforming-Based Multi-Hop Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"1554jsac0812ju.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081975S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280260,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Lopez-Valcarce","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6280235/6280260/6280260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto Lopez-Valcarce (S'95-M'01) received the Telecommunication Engineering degree from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

A novel relay-assisted strategy is proposed to improve the generated secret key rate. The main idea is to exploit the random channels associated with relay nodes in the network as additional random sources for the key generation. This approach is particularly useful when the channels between legitimate nodes change slowly. Four increasingly sophisticated yet more practical scenarios are studied, for which relay-assisted key generation protocols are proposed and are shown to be optimal or order-optimal in terms of the key rate. It is also shown that the multiplexing gain in the key rate scales linearly with the number of relays, which demonstrates that relay-assisted schemes substantially increase the key rate. This is in sharp contrast to scenarios with relays helping information transmission, in which the multiplexing gain does not scale with the number of relays. Furthermore, a cooperative scheme is also proposed in which relays help key generation but the generated keys are kept secure from these relays.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6280235/06280261.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Key Generation in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280261/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Key Generation in Wireless Networks","volume":"30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"September 2012","accessionNumber":"12933563","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280261/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Key Generation in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"1578jsac0812lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093062S","chronDate":"September  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6280235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6280235","articleId":"6280261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6280270,"authors":[{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","id":"38540610000"},{"name":"Zhimin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38556746400"},{"name":"Yuming Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Xu","id":"38559479300"},{"name":"Bo Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Gao","id":"38556726200"},{"name":"Ligang He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Ligang","lastName":"He","id":"37269852000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280270","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Topology","Processor scheduling","Scheduling","Schedules","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","processor scheduling","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical reaction optimization","heterogeneous computing environment","task scheduling","NP-hard problem","heterogeneous earliest finish time","HEFT","genetic algorithm","scheduling problem","intelligent approach","execution order assignment","task level","allocation algorithm","chemical-reaction-inspired metaheuristic","task processor","CRO-based algorithm","critical path on a processor","CPOP","computational cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["task scheduling","chemical reaction optimization","DAG","heterogeneous computing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280270","abstract":"Task scheduling has been proven to be NP-hard problem and we can usually approximate the best solutions with some classical algorithm, such as Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT), Genetic Algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a new method to schedule the execution of a group of dependent tasks for heterogeneous computing environments. The algorithm consists of two elements: An intelligent approach to assign the execution orders of tasks by task level, and an allocation algorithm based on chemical-reaction-inspired metaheuristic called Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) to map processors to tasks. The experiments show that the CRO-based algorithm performs consistently better than HEFT and Critical Path On a Processor (CPOP) without incurring much computational cost.

The market is flooded with various styles of options, which are difficult to price. Numerical techniques used for pricing take exorbitant time for reasonable accuracy in pricing results. Heuristic approaches such as Particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been proposed for option pricing, which provide same or better results for simple options than that of numerical techniques at much less computational cost (time). In this work, we first investigate the characteristics of PSO for option pricing and propose improvements to PSO modeling, which reduces the number of PSO parameters without loss of generality of the financial application under study. We have used our improved PSO (called NPSO) model to price complex chooser option, one of the complicated options in the market. Cooperation among particles of the NPSO helps reach the solution in less time. Interest in diversifying investments stems from the necessity to avert risk involved in any single type of investments. The complex chooser option is shown to exhibit the characteristics of a financial portfolio. As a further study, we have used NPSO for portfolio optimization. We have implemented our NPSO model in the state-of-the-art multi-core Graphics processing units (GPU) platform and show that the computational time can be significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.22","startPage":"103","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280281.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portfolio Management Using Particle Swarm Optimization on GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280281/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Portfolio Management Using Particle Swarm Optimization on GPU","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280281/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12948334","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portfolio Management Using Particle Swarm Optimization on GPU","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054313S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6280306,"authors":[{"name":"Yifat Yulevich","affiliation":["Software Solutions Department, IBM Israel Software Laboratory, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Yifat","lastName":"Yulevich","id":"38229986800"},{"name":"Alex Pyasik","affiliation":["Software Solutions Department, IBM Israel Software Laboratory, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Pyasik","id":"38468790100"},{"name":"Leonid Gorelik","affiliation":["Software Solutions Department, IBM Israel Software Laboratory, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Gorelik","id":"38468840000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280306","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Dictionaries","Detection algorithms","Principal component analysis","Kernel","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection algorithm","IBM InfoSphere Streams platform","performance optimization capability","cyber security","healthcare","finance","retail","KOAD","PCA","online anomaly detection","incremental learning","offline anomaly detection","data volume observation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents and shares excerpts from our implementation of near real-time anomaly detection algorithms on the IBM InfoSphere Streams platform. The purpose of this article is to: 1) Describe how to design and implement known anomaly detection algorithms on IBM InfoSphere Streams. 2) Present some performance optimization capabilities of IBM InfoSphere Streams platform and propose a method to use them in anomaly detection applications. 3) Present some IBM InfoSphere Streams best practices and describe how their adoption in the context of anomaly detection application. The document describes the architecture and design of anomaly detection algorithms developed on IBM InfoSphere Streams. Although the solution was designed to be used for cyber security, the implemented algorithms are agnostic regarding the data type that they monitor and therefore can detect anomalies in data from various industries such as healthcare, finance and retail. The document describes the implementation of two anomaly detection algorithms: KOAD and PCA. The KOAD algorithm performs online anomaly detection with incremental learning and the PCA algorithm in performs offline anomaly detection. The solution was designed to provide near real-time insight into low latency on large data volume observation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms on IBM InfoSphere Streams: Anomaly Detection for Data in Motion","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.145","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280306.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms on IBM InfoSphere Streams: Anomaly Detection for Data in Motion","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280306/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Algorithms on IBM InfoSphere Streams: Anomaly Detection for Data in Motion","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042456S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280307,"authors":[{"name":"Ami Marowka","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, College of Exact Sciences, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Ami","lastName":"Marowka","id":"37281743700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280307","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Graphics processing unit","Power demand","Analytical models","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","performance evaluation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous computing","Amdahl law","multicore architecture","next generation massive-core architecture","per watt performance optimization","heterogeneous chips","energy efficiency","scalability","power constraints","hybrid CPU-GPU processors","analytical model","energy limitations","processing modes","heterogeneous processors","simultaneous asymmetric modes","symmetric modes","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical model","CPU-GPU architecture","Performance","Energy efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280307","abstract":"Energy will be a major limiting factor in future multi-core architectures, so optimizing performance per watt should be a key driver for next generation massive-core architectures.

We investigated how energy efficiency and scalability are affected by the power constraints imposed on contemporary hybrid CPU-GPU processors.

Since, computational Grids are multi-criteria environments by nature, modern allocation algorithms should concern more than one criterion to produce scheduling solutions. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria Genetic Algorithm, which tries to eliminate the security risks and power consumption of the system, apart from the completion time of jobs. Although Genetic Algorithms are suitable for large search space problems such as job scheduling, they are too slow to be executed online. Hence, we changed the implementation of a traditional genetic algorithm, introducing the Accelerated Genetic Algorithm. In addition, Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead is also presented, which concerns the extra overhead caused by the application of Accelerated Genetic Algorithm. We propose the best combination of weights of each criterion of our Genetic Algorithm in order to maximize the performance of the system. Afterwards, Accelerated Genetic Algorithm and Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead are compared with three well-known heuristics. Simulation results indicate a substantial performance advantage of both Accelerated Genetic Algorithm and Accelerated Genetic Algorithm with Overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.48","startPage":"317","endPage":"324","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280308.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulation Study of Multi-criteria Scheduling in Grid Based on Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Genetic algorithms","Scheduling","Processor scheduling","Sociology","Statistics","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","grid computing","power consumption","search problems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicriteria scheduling","job scheduling","complex heterogeneous distributed system","computational grid","multicriteria environment","allocation algorithm","multicriteria genetic algorithm","security risk","power consumption","job completion time","search space problem","accelerated genetic algorithm with overhead","heuristics","grid computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-crteria","Genetic Algorithm","Grid Computing","Job Scheduling","Performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Simulation Study of Multi-criteria Scheduling in Grid Based on Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280308/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948361","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulation Study of Multi-criteria Scheduling in Grid Based on Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076939S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6280345,"authors":[{"name":"Mar\u00eda Arsuaga-R\u00edos","affiliation":["Extremadura Research Center for Advanced Technologies, Trujillo, Spain"],"firstName":"Mar\u00eda","lastName":"Arsuaga-R\u00edos","id":"38273634800"},{"name":"Francisco Prieto-Castrillo","affiliation":["Extremadura Research Center for Advanced Technologies, Trujillo, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Prieto-Castrillo","id":"38275013500"},{"name":"Miguel A.

On the other hand, a novel swarm algorithm is the Multiobjective Gravitational Search Algorithm (MOGSA) inspired on gravitational attraction. Although both algorithms render good performance, MOGSA dominates in all the cases. Moreover, MOGSA attains improved performance with real schedulers such as the Workload Management System (WMS) from the most used European middleware gLite and the well-known Deadline Budget Constraint (DBC) algorithm from Nimrod-G.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280345.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.85","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization Comparison - MOSWO vs MOGSA - for Solving the Job Scheduling Problem in Grid Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization Comparison - MOSWO vs MOGSA - for Solving the Job Scheduling Problem in Grid Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280345/","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280345/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948398","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization Comparison - MOSWO vs MOGSA - for Solving the Job Scheduling Problem in Grid Environments","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078548S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6280353,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Hei\u00dfwolf","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Hei\u00dfwolf","id":"37888312200"},{"name":"Ralf K\u00f6nig","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"K\u00f6nig","id":"37683208700"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Becker","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Becker","id":"37270020100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280353","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":550},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Quality of service","Round robin","Bandwidth","Routing","Time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","multiprocessing systems","network routing","network-on-chip","processor scheduling","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoC router design","networks-on-chip","QoS support","weighted round robin scheduling","many core SoC","system-on-chip","communication resources","virtual channel reservation","connection-oriented communication","connectionless best effort traffic","connection-oriented guaranteed service traffic","decentralized routing","resource management","many core architectures","SystemC router model","round robin arbitration schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks-on-Chip","Router Design","Quality of Service","QoS","Weighted Round Robin Scheduling","Guaranteed Service","Best Effort","Scalable","Scalability"]}],"abstract":"Networks on Chip are the most promising approach to cope with communication requirements in future many core SoCs.

The used weighted round robin scheduling provides hard guarantees regarding throughput and latency. The proposed router design enables dynamic sharing of communication resources between connectionless Best Effort and connection-oriented Guaranteed Service traffic. Due to decentralized routing and resource management it offers a very good scalability for future many core architectures.

Also a general OpenCL profiler has been developed to easily do a detailed profiling of the obtained results.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.100","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","startPage":"675","endPage":"682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Multi-device Load Balancing for OpenCL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Static Multi-device Load Balancing for OpenCL","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280360/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948413","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Multi-device Load Balancing for OpenCL","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051643S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6280375,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan Kovachev","affiliation":["Information Systems and Database Technologies, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Kovachev","id":"37940201600"},{"name":"Tian Yu","affiliation":["Information Systems and Database Technologies, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Yu","id":"38468789800"},{"name":"Ralf Klamma","affiliation":["Information Systems and Database Technologies, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Klamma","id":"37265300200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280375","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2112},"abstract":"The inherently limited processing power and battery lifetime of mobile phones hinder the possible execution of computationally intensive applications like content-based video analysis or 3D modeling. Offloading of computationally intensive application parts from the mobile platform into a remote cloud infrastructure or nearby idle computers addresses this problem. This paper presents our Mobile Augmentation Cloud Services (MACS) middleware which enables adaptive extension of Android application execution from a mobile client into the cloud. Applications are developed by using the standard Android development pattern. The middleware does the heavy lifting of adaptive application partitioning, resource monitoring and computation offloading. These elastic mobile applications can run as usual mobile application, but they can also reach transparently remote computing resources. Two prototype applications using the MACS middleware demonstrate the benefits of the approach. The evaluation shows that applications, which involve complicated algorithms and large computations, can benefit from offloading with around 95% energy savings and significant performance gains compared to local execution only.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6275525/6280267/06280375.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"791","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2012.115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2012.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6280267","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Computation Offloading from Mobile Devices into the Cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Middleware","Smart phones","Hardware","Computational modeling","Androids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","middleware","mobile computing","multimedia computing","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive computation offloading","mobile devices","remote cloud infrastructure","mobile phones","content-based video analysis","3D modeling","idle computers","mobile augmentation cloud services middleware","MACS middleware","Android development pattern","adaptive application partitioning","resource monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Computation Offloading from Mobile Devices into the Cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280375/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12948428","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2012","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Computation Offloading from Mobile Devices into the Cloud","confLoc":"Leganes, Spain","sourcePdf":"4701a784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091555S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6275525","isNumber":"6280267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6275525","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6280267","articleId":"6280375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6280396,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Di Lauro","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science, University of Naples Parthenope, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Di Lauro","id":"38468542100"},{"name":"Francesca Lucarelli","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science, University of Naples Parthenope, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Lucarelli","id":"38468543500"},{"name":"Raffaele Montella","affiliation":["Department of Applied Science, University of Naples Parthenope, Italy"],"firstName":"Raffaele","lastName":"Montella","id":"38187896700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1631-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4701-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6280396","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Sensors","Abstracts","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computerised instrumentation","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIaaS","sensing instrument as a service","cloud computing","ubiquitous service","data acquisition instruments","cloud infrastructure","physical sensing instrument","Internet connected device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Sensing instrument","Gvirtus","JaClouX","Abstract Execute Framework"]}],"abstract":"Sensing Instrument as a Service (SIaaS) is a new cloud service that allows users to use data acquisition instruments shared through cloud infrastructure.

Users communicate with each other by publishing text-based posts. The popularity and open structure of Twitter have attracted a large number of automated programs, known as bots, which appear to be a double-edged sword to Twitter. Legitimate bots generate a large amount of benign tweets delivering news and updating feeds, while malicious bots spread spam or malicious contents. More interestingly, in the middle between human and bot, there has emerged cyborg referred to either bot-assisted human or human-assisted bot. To assist human users in identifying who they are interacting with, this paper focuses on the classification of human, bot, and cyborg accounts on Twitter. We first conduct a set of large-scale measurements with a collection of over 500,000 accounts. We observe the difference among human, bot, and cyborg in terms of tweeting behavior, tweet content, and account properties. Based on the measurement results, we propose a classification system that includes the following four parts: 1) an entropy-based component, 2) a spam detection component, 3) an account properties component, and 4) a decision maker. It uses the combination of features extracted from an unknown user to determine the likelihood of being a human, bot, or cyborg. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed classification system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","volume":"9","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12996664","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2012","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6280553/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Automation of Twitter Accounts: Are You a Human, Bot, or Cyborg?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Automation of Twitter Accounts: Are You a Human, Bot, or Cyborg?","sourcePdf":"ttq2012060811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109442S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"6303808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"6303808","articleId":"6280553","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6280581,"authors":[{"name":"Peter J.

An offset-fed slot antenna and antenna width adjustments were employed in a single oscillator to increase the output power by increasing the radiation conductance and impedance matching. A high output power oscillation (~400 \u03bcW) at 530-590 GHz was obtained by RTDs with a large negative deferential conductance (NDC) region and offset-fed slot antennas. The maximization of the output power that was obtained by adjusting the antenna width was attributed to the impedance matching between the RTD and antenna. An output power of >;1 mW is theoretically expected in an oscillator that combines an RTD with a large NDC region, offset-fed slot antenna, and antenna width adjustment. In an array configuration, oscillators with an offset structure were employed for array elements and connected together with the metal-insulator-metal stub structure. A single peak was observed in the oscillation spectrum, and combined output powers of 610, 270, and 180 \u03bcW at 620, 770, and 810 GHz were obtained in a two-element array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13270684","externalId":"8500108","htmlLink":"/document/6280592/","displayDocTitle":"High-Power Operation of Terahertz Oscillators With Resonant Tunneling Diodes Using Impedance-Matched Antennas and Array Configuration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Power Operation of Terahertz Oscillators With Resonant Tunneling Diodes Using Impedance-Matched Antennas and Array Configuration","sourcePdf":"jstqe-suzuki-2215017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086094S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6428652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6428652","articleId":"6280592","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6280595,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Winkler","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC), University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6301690/6280595/6280595-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Winkler is Principal Scientist and Director of the Interactive Digital Media Program at the University of Illinois\u2019 Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC) in Singapore.

The proposed scheme only repeats peak canceling in the time domain without iteratively performing IFFT and FFT. Also, the application of the proposed PPC scheme to active constellation extension (ACE) can reduce the number of iterations of IFFT and FFT. Moreover, a transmit power allocation scheme is also suggested to relieve the degradation of bit error rate (BER) of the proposed PAPR reduction scheme.

In this situation, depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) has taken on an important role in 3D technology due to its low bandwidth cost and ease of depth configuration. Noting that the viewer could record provided center view or synthesized views for illegal distribution, it is clear that copyright protection must be taken into account for the DIBR 3D content, including the possibility that one single view could be illegally distributed as 2D content. In this paper, we propose a robust watermarking scheme for DIBR 3D images by quantization on dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) coefficients with consideration of imperceptibility. To make the proposed scheme robust to DIBR process, two characteristics of DT-CWT are employed: approximate shift invariance and directional selectivity. We select certain coefficient sub-blocks and group the coefficient rows based on the properties of DIBR. On the extraction side, the threshold is carefully chosen with a low false positive rate. The simulation results show that the embedded watermark is stably extracted from the center view and the synthesized left and right views. In addition, even if the synthesized left and right views are distorted by general attacks, the watermark is successfully extracted. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is robust to pre-processing of the depth image and baseline adjusting, which are common processing on the DIBR system for better quality of 3D views.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2012.2206851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6351840/06280599.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2012.2206851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6351840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust DT-CWT Watermarking for DIBR 3D Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280599/","displayDocTitle":"Robust DT-CWT Watermarking for DIBR 3D Images","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136051","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280599/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust DT-CWT Watermarking for DIBR 3D Images","sourcePdf":"tbc-kim-2206851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093131S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6351840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6351840","articleId":"6280599","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6280603,"authors":[{"name":"Zarko Stanisavljevic","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"],"bio":{"p":["Zarko Stanisavljevic received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.","He is currently a Teaching Assistant with the Department of Computer Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.

The SAS is intended to follow a Square Kilometre Array low-noise amplifier (SKA-LNA), which is being designed by others and is not a subject of this study, to obtain the high gain required from the SKA receiver. Due to the SKA ultra-low noise-temperature requirements, the SAS noise must be minimized, even though it is preceded by an SKA-LNA. The first two stages of the SAS consist of an inductorless partially noise-canceling resistive-feedback amplifier and a differential gain stage that achieve both low noise figures (NFs) and convert the single-ended input signal to a differential output. Following this, an additional gain stage is cascaded to increase the SAS gain. Over the midband SKA frequency range of 0.7-1.4 GHz, a 65-nm CMOS SAS achieves an S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n >; 34 dB, voltage gain >;36 dB, and sub-1-dB NFs (~75-K noise temperature), P1dB of >; -52 dBm, input third-order intercept point (IP3) of >;-43 dBm and input second-order intercept point (IP2) of >;-34 dBm, while consuming 96.8 mW of dc power.

This trend reflects a fundamental aspect of the current MAC protocol, which allocates the channel as a single resource at a time. This paper argues that, in a high data rate WLAN, the channel should be divided into separate subchannels whose width is commensurate with the PHY data rate and typical frame size. Multiple stations can then contend for and use subchannels simultaneously according to their traffic demands, thereby increasing overall efficiency. We introduce FICA, a fine-grained channel access method that embodies this approach to media access using two novel techniques. First, it proposes a new PHY architecture based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) that retains orthogonality among subchannels while relying solely on the coordination mechanisms in existing WLAN, carrier sensing and broadcasting. Second, FICA employs a frequency-domain contention method that uses physical-layer Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) signaling and frequency domain backoff to efficiently coordinate subchannel access. We have implemented FICA, both MAC and PHY layers, using a software radio platform, and our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the FICA design. Furthermore, our simulation results show FICA can improve the efficiency of WLANs from a few percent to 600% compared to existing 802.11.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6530642/06280607.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"787","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2212207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2212207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Channel Access in Wireless LAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wireless LAN","Sensors","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Media Access Protocol","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","telecommunication signalling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-grained channel access","physical-layer data rate","PHY data rate","modern wireless local area networks","modern wireless LAN","media access control protocol","MAC protocol","FICA method","fine-grained channel access method","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","frequency-domain contention method","physical-layer request to send-clear to send signaling","physical-layer RTS-CTS signaling","PHY layers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer","fine-grained channel access","media access control (MAC)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","wireless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Grained Channel Access in Wireless LAN","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6280607/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13563940","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Grained Channel Access in Wireless LAN","sourcePdf":"tnet-fang-2212207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11083S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6530642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6530642","articleId":"6280607","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6280612,"authors":[{"name":"Jordi Naqui","affiliation":["GEMMA/CIMITEC, Departament dEnginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Naqui","id":"38273680400"},{"name":"Miguel Duran-Sindreu","affiliation":["GEMMA/CIMITEC, Departament dEnginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Duran-Sindreu","id":"38272292600"},{"name":"Armando Fernandez-Prieto","affiliation":["Grupo de Microondas, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Armando","lastName":"Fernandez-Prieto","id":"38277083300"},{"name":"Francisco Mesa","affiliation":["Grupo de Microondas, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Mesa","id":"37264909900"},{"name":"Francisco Medina","affiliation":["Grupo de Microondas, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Medina","id":"37266814100"},{"name":"Ferran Martin","affiliation":["GEMMA/CIMITEC, Departament dEnginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"firstName":"Ferran","lastName":"Martin","id":"37279758900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6280612","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":762},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Transmission-line metamaterials based on complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) are shown to support forward, backward, electroinductive, and complex waves.

It is a magneto-electric dipole antenna whose gain and beamwidth keep constant along frequency within the operation bandwidth. If the antenna is ideally symmetrical, its differential port-to-port isolation is theoretically infinite. Due to the differentially-driven scheme, its cross-polarization level can be very low. Measurement shows that the proposed antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 68% (0.95 to 1.92 GHz) for differential reflection coefficients less than -10 dB and high differential port-to-port isolation of better than 36 dB within the bandwidth. The 3-dB-gain bandwidth of the proposed antenna is 62% (1.09 to 2.08 GHz), and the radiation pattern across it is stable and unidirectional. The broadside gain within the 3-dB-gain bandwidth ranges from 6.6 to 9.6 dBi. The cross-polarization level is lower than -23 dB across the 3-dB-gain bandwidth. The proposed antenna is the first differentially-driven dual-polarized magneto-electric dipole antenna.

We consider the multi-user MIMO system using a block diagonalization (BD) scheme and an eigenbeam-space division multiplexing (E-SDM) technique. In an ideal case, the BD scheme eliminates inter-user interference, and the E-SDM technique suppresses inter-stream interference. In actual radio environments, however, channels change over time. This causes interference in the multi-user MIMO system even though the BD scheme and the E-SDM technique are used. To overcome this problem, the authors have developed a simple channel prediction scheme on the basis of a linear extrapolation and have demonstrated its effectiveness by computer simulations assuming the Jakes' model. To verify the performance of the channel prediction scheme in actual environments, we conducted a measurement campaign in indoor environments and measured a large amount of channel data. Using these data, we examined the channel transition and channel tracking with the prediction method. Then we obtained the bit-error rate (BER) performance. The prediction technique was shown to track the channel and improve the BER performance almost to that in the ideal time invariant case.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2012.2214995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6397624/06280628.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2012.2214995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6397624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Multi-User MIMO System With Prediction of Time-Varying Indoor Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280628/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of a Multi-User MIMO System With Prediction of Time-Varying Indoor Channels","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13191155","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280628/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of a Multi-User MIMO System With Prediction of Time-Varying Indoor Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-ogawa-2214995-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121947S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6397624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6397624","articleId":"6280628","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6280629,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Sabban","affiliation":["Ort Braude College of Engineering, Karmiel, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6397624/6280629/6280629-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Albert Sabban (M'87\u2013SM'94) received the B.Sc degree and M.Sc. degree (Magna Cum Laude) from Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 1976 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Colorado University at Boulder in 1991.","In 1976, he joined the armament development authority RAFAEL in Israel.

Due to the large number of heartbeats constituting an ECG and the high cost of having all the heartbeats manually labeled, supervised learning techniques have achieved limited success in ECG classification. In this paper, we first discuss the rationale for applying multiple instance learning (MIL) to automated ECG classification and then propose a new MIL strategy called latent topic MIL, by which ECGs are mapped into a topic space defined by a number of topics identified over all the unlabeled training heartbeats and support vector machine is directly applied to the ECG-level topic vectors. Our experimental results on real ECG datasets from the PTB diagnostic database demonstrate that, compared with existing MIL and supervised learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to automatically detect ECGs with myocardial ischemia without labeling any heartbeats. Moreover, it improves classification quality in terms of both sensitivity and specificity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6361493/06280632.pdf","startPage":"3348","endPage":"3356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2213597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2213597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Analysis Using Multiple Instance Learning for Myocardial Infarction Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Heart beat","Classification algorithms","Feature extraction","Support vector machine classification","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electrocardiography","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG analysis","multiple instance learning","myocardial infarction detection","supervised learning techniques","automated ECG classification","MIL strategy","latent topic MIL","topic space","unlabeled training heartbeats","support vector machine","ECG-level topic vectors","ECG datasets","PTB diagnostic database","myocardial ischemia"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","ECG analysis","multiple instance learning (MIL)","myocardial infarction (MI)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adolescent","Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Electrocardiography","Female","Heart Rate","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Myocardial Infarction","Myocardial Infarction","ROC Curve","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Support Vector Machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"ECG Analysis Using Multiple Instance Learning for Myocardial Infarction Detection","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6280632/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13148471","pubMedId":"22929363","dateOfInsertion":"26 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Analysis Using Multiple Instance Learning for Myocardial Infarction Detection","sourcePdf":"tbme-lu-2213597-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066855S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6361493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6361493","articleId":"6280632","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6280634,"authors":[{"name":"Andrius Petrenas","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Institute, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6303890/6280634/6280634-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrius Petr\u0117nas received the B.Sc. degree in electronics engineering and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Biomedical Engineering Institute.","His research interests are mainly concentrated on application of novel artificial intelligence methods to biomedical signal processing."]},"firstName":"Andrius","lastName":"Petrenas","id":"38015826100"},{"name":"Vaidotas Marozas","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Institute, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6303890/6280634/6280634-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Vaidotas Marozas received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1993, 1995, and 2000 respectively.","He was a visiting Ph.D. student for several time periods during 1998\u20132000 in the Signal Processing Group, Department of Electroscience, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

The method is based on an echo state neural network which estimates the time-varying, nonlinear transfer function between two leads, one lead with atrial activity and another lead without, for the purpose of canceling ventricular activity. The network has different sets of weights that define the input, hidden, and output layers, of which only the output set is adapted for every new sample to be processed. The performance is evaluated on ECG signals, with simulated f-waves added, by determining the root mean square error between the true f-wave signal and the estimated signal, as well as by evaluating the dominant AF frequency. When compared to average beat subtraction (ABS), being the most widely used method for QRST cancellation, the performance is found to be significantly better with an error reduction factor of 0.24-0.43, depending on f-wave amplitude. The estimates of dominant AF frequency are considerably more accurate for all f-wave amplitudes than the AF estimates based on ABS. The novel method is particularly well suited for implementation in mobile health systems where monitoring of AF during extended time periods is of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2012.2212895","startPage":"2950","endPage":"2957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2212895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6303890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6303890/06280634.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Echo State Neural Network for QRST Cancellation During Atrial Fibrillation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280634/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Echo State Neural Network for QRST Cancellation During Atrial Fibrillation","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6280634/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13013776","pubMedId":"22929362","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Echo State Neural Network for QRST Cancellation During Atrial Fibrillation","sourcePdf":"tbme-petrenas-2212895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11416S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6303890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6303890","articleId":"6280634","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6280641,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Fogue","affiliation":["Computer Science and System Engineering Department (DIIS), University of Zaragoza, Teruel, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6530642/6280641/6280641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuel Fogue received the B.Sc. degree in computer science with honors from the University of Zaragoza, Teruel, Spain, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science with honors from the University Jaume I of Castellon, Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, Spain, in 2009, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Intelligent Networks and Information Technologies (iNiT) research group, University of Zaragoza.","His research interests include VANET simulation, intelligent transportation systems, traffic safety, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications."]},"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fogue","id":"37547955400"},{"name":"Piedad Garrido","affiliation":["Computer Science and System Engineering Department (DIIS), University of Zaragoza, Teruel, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6530642/6280641/6280641-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Piedad Garrido (M'10) graduated in Computer Science and Documentation from the Technical University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain, in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

Regarding traffic safety applications for VANETs, warning messages have to be quickly and smartly disseminated in order to reduce the required dissemination time and to increase the number of vehicles receiving the traffic warning information. In the past, several approaches have been proposed to improve the alert dissemination process in multihop wireless networks, but none of them were tested in real urban scenarios, adapting its behavior to the propagation features of the scenario. In this paper, we present the Profile-driven Adaptive Warning Dissemination Scheme (PAWDS) designed to improve the warning message dissemination process. With respect to previous proposals, our proposed scheme uses a mapping technique based on adapting the dissemination strategy according to both the characteristics of the street area where the vehicles are moving and the density of vehicles in the target scenario. Our algorithm reported a noticeable improvement in the performance of alert dissemination processes in scenarios based on real city maps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive System Based on Roadmap Profiling to Enhance Warning Message Dissemination in VANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2212206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6530642/06280641.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2212206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive System Based on Roadmap Profiling to Enhance Warning Message Dissemination in VANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6280641/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13563942","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive System Based on Roadmap Profiling to Enhance Warning Message Dissemination in VANETs","sourcePdf":"tnet-martinez-2212206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082078S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6530642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6530642","articleId":"6280641","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6280642,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Pefkianakis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6530642/6280642/6280642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Pefkianakis (A'06) received the Bachelor's degree (with honors) in computer engineering and informatics from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles.","His research interests include wireless networking and mobile systems."]},"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pefkianakis","id":"37322148000"},{"name":"Suk-Bok Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6530642/6280642/6280642-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Suk-Bok Lee (M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer engineering from Hong-Ik University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2011.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow in computer science with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, from 2011 to 2012, and is now an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.

It is proven that all such algorithms are MIMO-mode oblivious; they do not differentiate spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing modes. We first design MiRA, a novel MIMO RA scheme that zigzags between intra- and inter-MIMO modes to address MIMO 802.11n dynamics. Second, we examine a window-based RA solution, which runs an independent RA in each MIMO mode in parallel and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based MIMO RA that differentiates modes using SNR measurements. Our experiments show that MIMO-mode aware designs outperform MIMO-mode oblivious RAs in various settings, with goodput gains up to 73.5% in field trials.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards MIMO-Aware 802.11n Rate Adaptation","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2012.2207908","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6530642/06280642.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2012.2207908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards MIMO-Aware 802.11n Rate Adaptation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6280642/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13563943","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards MIMO-Aware 802.11n Rate Adaptation","sourcePdf":"tnet-pefkianakis-2207908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121382S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6530642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6530642","articleId":"6280642","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6280646,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Priebe","affiliation":["Terahertz Communications Lab, Braunschweig, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6291838/6280646/6280646-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sebastian Priebe was born in Braunschweig, Germany, in 1985.

Aiming for coexistent use of the THz band by both active and passive applications, this paper identifies critical scenarios where interference can possibly occur. Atmospheric attenuation simulations are used along with appropriate propagation models to account for correct scenario-specific wave propagation conditions. Furthermore, distance-dependent measurements of the path loss are taken at 300 GHz. The atmospheric attenuation and propagation models are then employed in order to simulate possible interference powers for the individual reference scenarios under worst case-conditions. Based on existing data for the maximum allowed interference, guidelines for appropriate system specifications of active THz hardware (e.g., transmit power constraints) are developed and achievable system performances are evaluated. Countermeasures against potential interference are discussed. Thus, any interference can be anticipated and compensated for already in the early design phase of THz communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","volume":"2","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"12961094","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280646/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interference Investigations of Active Communications and Passive Earth Exploration Services in the THz Frequency Range","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Investigations of Active Communications and Passive Earth Exploration Services in the THz Frequency Range","sourcePdf":"tthz-priebe-2208191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123046S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6291838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6291838","articleId":"6280646","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6280655,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixin Miao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6340605/6280655/6280655-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhixin Miao (S\u201900\u2013M\u201903\u2013SM\u201909) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1992, the M.S.E.E. degree from the Graduate School, Nanjing Automation Research Institute, Nanjing, China, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from West Virginia University, Morgantown, in 2002.","He is currently with the University of South Florida (USF), Tampa.

The TROMAG is a magnetic device consisting of a rotor and a translator with an air gap in between, capable of converting linear motion to rotation, and vice versa, and doing the gearing action at the same time. Although its structure suggests that the TROMAG is simply the magnetic dual to the mechanical lead-screw, the authors show that the concept could also be derived from the elementary magnet arrays. The paper tries to establish an analogy between the TROMAG and the ordinary electrical machines with respect to the number of poles and the stack length, thus providing a deeper insight into the device operation. Three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) is deployed to obtain the torque and force characteristics. Furthermore, it is shown that in addition to the permanent magnet (PM) TROMAG, developing the reluctance and the induction TROMAG is possible as well, but at a lower force density.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2012.2215046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6416962/06280670.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6416962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2012.2215046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Principles of the Trans-Rotary Magnetic Gear","volume":"49","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280670/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13250218","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280670/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles of the Trans-Rotary Magnetic Gear","sourcePdf":"tmag-pakdelian-2215046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059445S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6416962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6416962","articleId":"6280670","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6280674,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Rieger","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6403583/6280674/6280674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Rieger (M'08) received the B.

Custom-designed variable gain amplifiers (ASIC) are used as part of the recording setup. The circuit gain and balance is set by the timing of microcontroller generated clock signals. Measured results are presented which confirm that improved common-mode rejection is achieved compared to a single differential amplifier in the presence of input network imbalance.

It can be powered by the ac mains, low-frequency electromagnetic ballast, or high-frequency electronic ballast. Its input impedance is controlled to meet the operational requirements and conditions of different sources and its output is controlled to deliver the required power to the LED array. When the driver is powered by a low-frequency source, like ac mains or low-frequency electromagnetic ballast, it is configured as an active power factor corrector. Its input current follows the wave shape of the source voltage. When the driver is powered by a high-frequency source, like electronic ballast, it is configured as a phase-shifted resonant converter with controllable input resistance and susceptance. Moreover, the driver has a startup mechanism that emulates the ignition process of a fluorescent lamp. Such a wide source compatibility of the driver enables the lamp be applied in new lighting installations or retrofitting fluorescent lamps with LED lamps without modification of existing ballasts and/or lighting infrastructure. A 20-W prototype, which is designed to retrofit a 36-W T8 fluorescent lamp, has been built and evaluated with different sources, including ac mains (110 V/60 Hz, 220 V/50 Hz), electromagnetic ballast, and electronic ballast.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","LED lamps","Electromagnetics","Fluorescent lamps","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lamp accessories","LED lamps","power factor correction","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED lamp driver","low-frequency electromagnetic ballast","high-frequency electronic ballast","LED array","active power factor corrector","wave shape","source voltage","high-frequency source","low-frequency source","phase-shifted resonant converter","ignition process","fluorescent lamp","retrofitting fluorescent lamp","power 20 W","power 36 W","voltage 110 V","voltage 220 V","frequency 50 Hz","frequency 60 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC/DC conversion","dc/ac conversion","LED lighting","lighting control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2213098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6361328/06280676.pdf","startPage":"2551","endPage":"2568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2213098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LED Lamp Driver Compatible With Low- and High-Frequency Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6280676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An LED Lamp Driver Compatible With Low- and High-Frequency Sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280676/","volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280676/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13146880","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LED Lamp Driver Compatible With Low- and High-Frequency Sources","sourcePdf":"tpel-chung-2213098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081126S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6280676","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6280677,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Yilmaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6280677/6280677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Yilmaz (S\u201997\u2013M\u201907) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Istanbul, Turkey, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the same university, in 1999 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana.

Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"28","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13146881","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6280677/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Review of Battery Charger Topologies, Charging Power Levels, and Infrastructure for Plug-In Electric and Hybrid Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Battery Charger Topologies, Charging Power Levels, and Infrastructure for Plug-In Electric and Hybrid Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-yilmaz-2212917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207592S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"1461","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6280677","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6280681,"authors":[{"name":"Carina B.

In this paper, an APPJ with simple configuration was designed and applied for surface treatment of polycarbonate (PC) films. Optical emission spectroscopy was used to identify the excited plasma species presented inside the device and in the plasma plume. Material characterization was carried out by water contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy.

In this paper, three discrete-time ZNN models are first proposed to solve the problem of time-varying quadratic minimization (TVQM). Such discrete-time ZNN models exploit methodologically the time derivatives of time-varying coefficients and the inverse of the time-varying coefficient matrix. To eliminate explicit matrix-inversion operation, the quasi-Newton BFGS method is introduced, which approximates effectively the inverse of the Hessian matrix; thus, three discrete-time ZNN models combined with the quasi-Newton BFGS method (named ZNN-BFGS) are proposed and investigated for TVQM. In addition, according to the criterion of whether the time-derivative information of time-varying coefficients is explicitly known/used or not, these proposed discrete-time models are classified into three categories: 1) models with time-derivative information known (i.e., ZNN-K and ZNN-BFGS-K models), 2) models with time-derivative information unknown (i.e., ZNN-U and ZNN-BFGS-U models), and 3) simplified models without using time-derivative information (i.e., ZNN-S and ZNN-BFGS-S models).

The applicability of interference statistics, however, is limited by the assumptions adopted to derive the statistics in closed-form. Common assumptions for a decentralized wireless network include temporally independent user locations and an unbounded pathloss function. In this correspondence, we derive the joint temporal statistics of interference that capture the temporal correlation in the network along with the realistic assumption of a bounded pathloss function. The closed-form statistics are asymptotically exact for low tail probabilities, and match closely in simulations even when the tail probability is fairly high. The primary contributions are to i) show that joint interference statistics follow a multivariate Gaussian mixture distribution under the assumption of a bounded pathloss function, and ii) characterize the joint tail probability decay behavior for both bounded and unbounded pathloss functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6357313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6357313/06280685.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2012.2215025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2012.2215025","startPage":"6713","endPage":"6718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Temporal Statistics of Interference in Decentralized Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6280685/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Temporal Statistics of Interference in Decentralized Wireless Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6280685/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13146519","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Temporal Statistics of Interference in Decentralized Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-gulati-2215025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069539S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6357313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6357313","articleId":"6280685","onlineDate":"23 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6280706,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Mooradian","affiliation":["Technology Solutions Group, QinetiQ North America, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Mooradian","id":"38469167700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1527-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1526-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1525-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1099-4742"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8614"}],"articleNumber":"6280706","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Receivers","Underwater vehicles","Attenuation","Scattering","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser beam applications","optical communication equipment","underwater optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["undersea laser communications","blue-green laser communications","undersea network performance","data rate"]}],"abstract":"Blue-Green Laser Communication is the \u201cgame-changer\u201d in Undersea Dominance, connecting the Undersea Network.

The system chooses and schedules the robot's actions, adapts to the human partner, and acts to minimize the human's idle time. We evaluate Chaski in human subject experiments in which a person works with a mobile and dexterous robot to collaboratively assemble structures using building blocks. We measure team performance outcomes for robots controlled by Chaski compared to robots that are verbally commanded, step-by-step by the human teammate. We show that Chaski reduces the human's idle time by 85%, a statistically significant difference. This result supports the hypothesis that human-robot team performance is improved when a robot emulates the effective coordination behaviors observed in human teams.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

camera","abstract":"Pointing gestures are a common and intuitive way to draw somebody's attention to a certain object. While humans can easily interpret robot gestures, the perception of human behavior using robot sensors is more difficult. In this work, we propose a method for perceiving pointing gestures using a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera. To determine the intended pointing target, frequently the line between a person's eyes and hand is assumed to be the pointing direction. However, since people tend to keep the line-of-sight free while they are pointing, this simple approximation is inadequate. Moreover, depending on the distance and angle to the pointing target, the line between shoulder and hand or elbow and hand may yield better interpretations of the pointing direction. In order to achieve a better estimate, we extract a set of body features from depth and amplitude images of a ToF camera and train a model of pointing directions using Gaussian Process Regression. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimated pointing direction in a quantitative study. The results show that our learned model achieves far better accuracy than simple criteria like head-hand, shoulder-hand, or elbow-hand line.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 March 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6281384/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12964067","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to interpret pointing gestures with a time-of-flight camera","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to interpret pointing gestures with a time-of-flight camera","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"p481droeschel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089613S","chronDate":"8-11 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6267011","isNumber":"6281241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6267011","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6281241","articleId":"6281384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6281385,"authors":[{"name":"Maya Cakmak","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Cakmak","id":"37409159800"},{"name":"Siddhartha S.

In this paper we address the fluency of robot-human hand-overs. From an observational study with our robot HERB, we identify the key problems with a baseline hand-over action. We find that the failure to convey the intention of handing over causes delays in the transfer, while the lack of an intuitive signal to indicate timing of the hand-over causes early, unsuccessful attempts to take the object. We propose to address these problems with the use of spatial contrast, in the form of distinct hand-over poses, and temporal contrast, in the form of unambiguous transitions to the hand-over pose. We conduct a survey to identify distinct hand-over poses, and determine variables of the pose that have most communicative potential for the intent of handing over. We present an experiment that analyzes the effect of the two types of contrast on the fluency of hand-overs. We find that temporal contrast is particularly useful in improving fluency by eliminating early attempts of the human.","doi":"10.1145/1957656.1957823","publicationTitle":"2011 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6267011/6281241/06281385.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1957656.1957823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using spatial and temporal contrast for fluent robot-human hand-overs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using spatial and temporal contrast for fluent robot-human hand-overs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12964068","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281385/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 March 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 March 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using spatial and temporal contrast for fluent robot-human hand-overs","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"p489cakmak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037654S","chronDate":"8-11 March 2011","isNumber":"6281241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6267011","citationCount":"32","articleId":"6281385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6281390,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Takayama","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA","Willow Garage, Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Takayama","id":"37395850000"},{"name":"Doug Dooley","affiliation":["Pixar Animation Studios, Emeryville, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Dooley","id":"38469116200"},{"name":"Wendy Ju","affiliation":["Willow Garage, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA","Willow Garage, Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wendy","lastName":"Ju","id":"38236984000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4395-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4393-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0561-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-2148"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-2121"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2167-2121"}],"articleNumber":"6281390","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":651},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6281390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Animation","Robot sensing systems","Humans","Dairy products","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer animation","control engineering computing","human-robot interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot readability","animation principles","animation techniques","human readable robot behaviors","forethought","human-robot interaction behaviors","online video prototype experiment","goal-oriented reactions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human-robot interaction","Animation"]}],"abstract":"The animation techniques of anticipation and reaction can help create robot behaviors that are human readable such that people can figure out what the robot is doing, reasonably predict what the robot will do next, and ultimately interact with the robot in an effective way.

This method is able to accurately predict the damping of each mode of oscillation and also to locate the variables, monitored by operators, having the biggest influence on the mode dynamics. The method consists of three steps. First, a database of historical data is set up for each potentially dangerous mode of oscillation. This database contains as inputs a set of operating conditions and as output the corresponding mode damping ratio. Afterwards, the input-output pairs \u201coperating conditions - mode damping ratio\u201d are used to build an ensemble of regression trees whose structure is analyzed to identify the most relevant variables. In the last step, a second tree-based regressor is run by considering only as inputs these most relevant variables in order to have a low-dimensional predictor. The usefulness of the predictors to avoid poorly damped operating points is then presented. The approach is tested on a 16-machine power system and gives good results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6281571/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12963578","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Building low-dimensional damping predictors of the power system modes of oscillation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building low-dimensional damping predictors of the power system modes of oscillation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"TD2012000417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063561S","chronDate":"7-10 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6267012","isNumber":"6281396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6267012","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281396","articleId":"6281571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6281577,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Ran","affiliation":["Power engineering, Changsha University of Science and technology, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaohong Ran was born in Chongqing Province, China in 1984.

In order to reduce unnecessary energy wasting and the random of supplying cold heat and power in different operation condition, so the coordination cost of cold heat and power is set up according to the theory of changing price with time. So a multi-objective optimization model of energy-saving dispatch is formulated based on generation cost, environmental cost and coordination cost of CCHP, and then we solve the problem with the fuzzy optimization programming. The results show that the model is vital in economic dispatch, especially after considering coordination cost, not only can effective manage the need of power and realize peak load shaving. The more important is to be able to change energy production and operation way due to the mismatching of cold heat and power load.

Analysis of AMI voltage data determines a subset of meters representing the lowest customer voltages; these meters are read every 15 minutes and used to determine the optimal feeder voltage. A statistical evaluation of pilot feeders shows a CVR factor of 0.92% reduction in energy for each 1% reduction in voltage. In addition, customer voltage monitoring identifies operational issues prior to customer calls.

This paper examines the potential impact of distributed wind generation on ramping requirements in the IEEE 24-bus system. Wind generation and load are modeled probabilistically using actual data and curve fitting. Probabilistic unit commitment (UC) based on unit de-commitment method and two-point estimate method is used to determine the ramping required to compensate for the wind power fluctuations and load uncertainty. The proposed method considers stochastic factors and their affects on the dispatch results. Different scenarios are studied to evaluate dispersed wind generation and its potential to reduce the ramping requirement and system operation cost. Ramping requirements of the system are calculated for 24 hours day ahead scheduling period and different wind penetration levels. A brief analysis is also carried out regarding the system operation cost and the potential reduction of this cost due to dispersed wind generation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind power generation","Probabilistic logic","Wind speed","Wind farms","Uncertainty","Load modeling","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","distributed power generation","IEEE standards","load (electric)","power generation economics","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersed wind generation","power system operation","high wind penetration","distributed wind generation","IEEE 24-bus system","curve fitting","probabilistic unit commitment","unit decommitment method","two-point estimate method","wind power fluctuation","load uncertainty","stochastic factors","system operation cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed wind generation","ramping requirements","stochastic modeling","two-point estimate method","unit commitment","unit de-commitment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDC.2012.6281655","publicationTitle":"PES T&D 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"PES T&D 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6267012/6281396/06281655.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2012.6281655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ramping requirements and operation cost in a power system with dispersed wind generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6281655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ramping requirements and operation cost in a power system with dispersed wind generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281655/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6281655/","accessionNumber":"12963649","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ramping requirements and operation cost in a power system with dispersed wind generation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"TD2012000564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07994S","chronDate":"7-10 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6267012","isNumber":"6281396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6267012","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6281396","articleId":"6281655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6281668,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Maknouninejad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6267012/6281396/6281668/6281668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Maknouninejad Received his Electrical Engineering B.Sc from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran in 2001.

Power objectives include maintaining active power flow to the main grid at a predetermined level, minimizing the reactive power flow to the main grid and maintaining a unified voltage profile across the microgrid. DGs are organized differently for active and reactive power control. All DGs realize active power objective in one group. As reactive power is used to maintain the unified voltage, DGs are grouped in several clusters to regulate multiple critical point voltages. The closest cluster to the point of common coupling, minimizes the reactive power flow and others manage their reactive power to regulate their critical points. Each cluster has a virtual leader which other DGs follow, utilizing the cooperative control. The cooperative law is also derived, based on the dynamics of the inverters.","doi":"10.1109/TDC.2012.6281668","publicationTitle":"PES T&D 2012","displayPublicationTitle":"PES T&D 2012","pdfPath":"/iel5/6267012/6281396/06281668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDC.2012.6281668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281396","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering and cooperative control of distributed generators for maintaining microgrid unified voltage profile and complex power control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6281668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustering and cooperative control of distributed generators for maintaining microgrid unified voltage profile and complex power control","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281668/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12963662","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6281668/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering and cooperative control of distributed generators for maintaining microgrid unified voltage profile and complex power control","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"TD2012000591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04935S","chronDate":"7-10 May 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6267012","isNumber":"6281396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6267012","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6281396","articleId":"6281668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6281678,"authors":[{"name":"John Adams","affiliation":["Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc., Taylor, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6267012/6281396/6281678/6281678-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":[" John Adams received his B.S.E.E. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1982.

Verification-based algorithms are particularly interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension n). The analysis predicts the average fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration \u2113 where the average is taken over the ensembles of input signals and sensing matrices. The analysis is asymptotic (n \u2192 \u221e) and is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the proposed method is much simpler and more accurate. This allows us to design irregular sensing graphs for such recovery algorithms. The designed irregular graphs outperform the corresponding regular graphs substantially. For example, for the same recovery complexity per iteration, we design irregular graphs that can recover up to about 40% more non-zero signal elements compared to the regular graphs. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of n.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6281807","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06281807.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6281807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of irregular graphs for node-based verification-based recovery algorithms in compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6281807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of irregular graphs for node-based verification-based recovery algorithms in compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281807/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962784","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6281807/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of irregular graphs for node-based verification-based recovery algorithms in compressed sensing","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1872eftekhari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072574S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6281807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6281897,"authors":[{"name":"Dipankar Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, University Institute of Technology, University of Burdwan, Burdwan, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Dipankar","lastName":"Dutta","id":"38244596400"},{"name":"Paramartha Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Computer and System Sciences, Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Paramartha","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37429446600"},{"name":"Jaya Sil","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Jaya","lastName":"Sil","id":"37388871100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2149-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2148-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2147-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6281897","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6281897","abstract":"In the paper, real coded multi objective genetic algorithm based K-clustering method has been studied where K represents the number of clusters known apriori.

sensor of a cement mill using generalized regression neural network","abstract":"Soft sensors play an important role in predicting the values of unmeasured process variables from knowledge of easily measured process variables. Most of the present day soft sensors for complex chemical processes are designed from actual industrial data because of the various difficulties associated with developing first principle models such as poor process understanding, impossible or difficult to determine model parameters and mathematical complexity of the models. No hardware sensors for online estimation of particle size is available for solid grinding units. In the present work a generalized regression neural network based model of a cement mill is developed based on the actual plant data for estimation of cement fineness. The collected raw industrial data is pre processed to get rid of the outliers and missing values followed by model development. Optimal selection of smoothing parameter for the regression model has been done by investigating the model performance at different spread values. Simulations results show satisfactory prediction capabilities of the developed model over that of linear regression model and quadratic response surface model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6281902/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12964085","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6281902/","publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"18-20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data driven soft sensor of a cement mill using generalized regression neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data driven soft sensor of a cement mill using generalized regression neural network","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"PID2473001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096932S","chronDate":"18-20 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268629","isNumber":"6281893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268629","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6281893","articleId":"6281902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6281954,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To fully utilize future multi-level cell Flash memories, it is necessary to develop error correction coding schemes attuned to the underlying physical characteristics of Flash. Based on a careful inspection of fine-grained, experimentally-collected error patterns of TLC (three bits per cell) Flash, we propose a mathematical model that captures the intracell variability, which is manifested by certain patterns of bit-errors.

In this paper, a novel scheme of real-time motion estimation for Intelligent bionic leg based on interjoint coordination is proposed. To measure the gait during walking, inertial sensors are mounted on the CoGs of bilateral thighs and shanks to acquire angular velocities of lower limbs of subjects. For the existence of linear correlation between bilateral kinematics in healthy symmetrical human gait, principle components analysis is employed to model the interjoint coordination and is used to estimate the knee joint angle of intelligent bionic leg from body motion of amputee. To improve the presicion of motion estimation further, RBF neural networks are used to optimally calculate the knee joint angle. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6282860/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12962384","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6282860/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intelligent bionic leg motion estimation based on interjoint coordination using PCA and RBF neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent bionic leg motion estimation based on interjoint coordination using PCA and RBF neural networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061379S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6282860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6282881,"authors":[{"name":"Qingling Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Electronic & Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qingling","lastName":"Li","id":"37291117500"},{"name":"Yu Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic & Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Song","id":"37293362600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6282881","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Training","Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Muscles","Pattern recognition","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence","electromyography","feature extraction","medical robotics","neural nets","patient rehabilitation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sEMG control strategy","upper limb rehabilitation robot","surface electromyography","stroke","patient intention","feature extraction","nonstationary feature","ensemble classification method","BP base classifier","upper limb motion discrimination","recognition rate","classifier convergence speed","generalization ability","neural network classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6282881","abstract":"This paper presents a surface electromyography (sEMG) control strategy for robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation after stroke which can make the rehabilitation robot follow the patient's intention.

We also prove a new lower bound to a three receiver wiretap broadcast channel under a strong secrecy criterion. We observe that we can directly prove the strong notion of secrecy without resorting to the common techniques, e.g., the leftover hash lemma.

More specifically, we show that by forcing natural constraints on the set of learning patterns, we can drastically improve the retrieval capacity of our neural network.

Our decision processes, emotions and interactions with the world around us are based on and driven by associations to our memories. This natural association paradigm will become critical in future memory systems, namely, the key question will not be \u201cHow do I store more information?\u201d but rather, \u201cDo I have the relevant information? How do I retrieve it?\u201d The focus of this paper is to make a first step in this direction. We define and solve a very basic problem in associative retrieval. Given a word W, the words in the memory that are t-associated with W are the words in the ball of radius t around W. In general, given a set of words, say W, X and Y, the words that are t-associated with {W, X, Y} are those in the memory that are within distance t from all the three words. Our main goal is to study the maximum size of the t-associated set as a function of the number of input words and the minimum distance of the words in memory - we call this value the uncertainty of an associative memory. We derive the uncertainty of the associative memory that consists of all the binary vectors with an arbitrary number of input words. In addition, we study the retrieval problem, namely, how do we get the t-associated set given the inputs? We note that this paradigm is a generalization of the sequences reconstruction problem that was proposed by Leven-shtein (2001). In this model, a word is transmitted over multiple channels. A decoder receives all the channel outputs and decodes the transmitted word. Levenshtein computed the minimum number of channels that guarantee a successful decoder - this value happens to be the uncertainty of an associative memory with two input words.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283016","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the uncertainty of information retrieval in associative memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the uncertainty of information retrieval in associative memories","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283016/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962802","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283016/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the uncertainty of information retrieval in associative memories","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p106yaakobi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074347S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283029,"authors":[{"name":"Fanggang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, EIE, Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fanggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37535910000"},{"name":"Soung Chang Liew","affiliation":["Institute of Network Coding, The Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Soung Chang","lastName":"Liew","id":"37279300600"},{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37272631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283029","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","MIMO","Switches","Network coding","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","least mean squares methods","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless MIMO switching","MMSE relaying","wireless relay","one-to-one mapping","uplinks","downlinks","multiple-input-multiple-output switch","precode-and-forward","vector signal","broadcasting","receive filter","interference","minimum-mean-square-error","ZF-MMSE schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","MIMO switching","MMSE","multi-way relaying","network coding","relay"]}],"abstract":"A wireless relay which forms a one-to-one mapping from the inputs (uplinks) to the outputs (downlinks) is called a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) switch. The MIMO switch carries out precode-and-forward, where all users send their signals in the uplink and then the MIMO switch precodes the received vector signal for broadcasting in the downlink. Ideally, each user employs a receive filter to recover its desired signal from one other user with no or little interference from other users. We propose a joint design of the precoder and the receive filters to achieve the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), assuming full channel state information is available at the relay. Our results indicate that the proposed MMSE relaying scheme outperforms the existing ZF/MMSE schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283029","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless MIMO switching with MMSE relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless MIMO switching with MMSE relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283029/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962815","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283029/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless MIMO switching with MMSE relaying","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1127wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078174S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283031,"authors":[{"name":"Alexei Ashikhmin","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Ashikhmin","id":"37272162900"},{"name":"Thomas Marzetta","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Marzetta","id":"37282754500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283031","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":189,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":4477},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Interference","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Fading","Contamination"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","antenna arrays","cellular radio","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot contamination precoding","multicell large scale antenna systems","base station antennas","spectral-efficiency","energy-efficiency","MIMO technology","multicellular LSAS","asymptotic regime","directed inter-cellular interference","reverse-link pilot sequences","TDD LSAS systems","slow- fading coefficients","PCP-combined symbols","fast-fading coefficients"]}],"abstract":"An LSAS entails a large number (tens or hundreds) of base station antennas serving a much smaller number of terminals, with large gains in spectral-efficiency and energy-efficiency compared with conventional MIMO technology. Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular LSAS, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends to infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular interference. The interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link pilot sequences (pilot contamination) by terminals in different cells. We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell interference in TDD LSAS systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call pilot contamination pre-coding (PCP). The main idea of PCP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to terminals from different cells that re-use the same pilot sequence. Crucially, the combining coefficients depend only on the slow-fading coefficients between the terminals and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its PCP-combined symbols using conventional linear pre-coding that is based on estimated fast-fading coefficients. Further we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with PCP and finite number of antennas M.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283031","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1141","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283031.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot contamination precoding in multi-cell large scale antenna systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283031/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Pilot contamination precoding in multi-cell large scale antenna systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12962817","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283031/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot contamination precoding in multi-cell large scale antenna systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1137ashikhmin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052453S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6283033,"authors":[{"name":"Song-Nam Hong","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Song-Nam","lastName":"Hong","id":"38239277300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37267243200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283033","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":286},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Lattices","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","Quantization","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","multi-access systems","precoding","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity architecture","downlink distributed antenna systems","L antenna terminals","central processor","digital error-free links","K user terminals","general multiple-access relay","broadcast relay networks","reverse quantized compute and forward","downlink precoding scheme","state-of-the-art available","channel-based user selection","system matrix","rank deficiency problem","RQCoF"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283033","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283033.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse compute and forward: A low-complexity architecture for downlink distributed antenna systems","abstract":"We consider a distributed antenna system where L antenna terminals (ATs) are connected to a Central Processor (CP) via digital error-free links of finite capacity R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, and serve K user terminals (UTs).

If an MDS code has r parities and no more than r erasures occur, then by transmitting all the remaining data in the code one can recover the original information. However, it was shown that in order to recover a single symbol erasure, only a fraction of 1/r of the information needs to be transmitted. This fraction is called the repair bandwidth (fraction). Explicit code constructions were given in previous works. If we view each symbol in the code as a vector or a column, then the code forms a 2D array and such codes are especially widely used in storage systems.

This paper summarizes a systematic framework for incorporating such approximate message passing (AMP) methods in general graphical models. The key concept is a partition of dependencies of a general graphical model into strong and weak edges, with each weak edge representing a small, linearizable coupling of variables. AMP approximations based on the central limit theorem can be applied to the weak edges and integrated with standard message passing updates on the strong edges. The resulting algorithm, which we call hybrid generalized approximate message passing (Hybrid-GAMP), can yield significantly simpler implementations of sum-product and max-sum loopy belief propagation. By varying the partition between strong and weak edges, a performance-complexity trade-off can be achieved. Structured sparsity problems are studied as an example of this general methodology where there is a natural partition of edges.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283054.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1240","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid generalized approximate message passing with applications to structured sparsity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Message passing","Graphical models","Approximation algorithms","Vectors","Belief propagation","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Gaussian processes","graph theory","inference mechanisms","message passing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid generalized approximate message passing","structured sparsity","Gaussian approximations","quadratic approximations","graphs","computational simplicity","analytic tractability","optimization","statistical inference problems","general graphical models","hybrid-GAMP","max-sum loopy belief propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid generalized approximate message passing with applications to structured sparsity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962840","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid generalized approximate message passing with applications to structured sparsity","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1236rangan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069238S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283056,"authors":[{"name":"Sundeep Rangan","firstName":"Sundeep","lastName":"Rangan","id":"38516986200"},{"name":"Alyson K.

The method is similar to approximate message passing techniques based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation that have been used recently in compressed sensing. Leveraging analysis methods by Bayati and Montanari, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the estimates from the proposed iterative procedure is described by a simple scalar equivalent model, where the distribution of the estimates is identical to certain scalar estimates of the variables in Gaussian noise. Moreover, the effective Gaussian noise level is described by a set of state evolution equations. The proposed method thus provides a computationally simple and general method for rank-one estimation problems with a precise analysis in certain high-dimensional settings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283056/","accessionNumber":"12962842","displayDocTitle":"Iterative estimation of constrained rank-one matrices in noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative estimation of constrained rank-one matrices in noise","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1246rangan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064814S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283058,"authors":[{"name":"Ronit Bustin","affiliation":["Dept.

While most theoretical studies only account for the energy requirements of communication, the sensing process, which includes measurements and compression, can also consume comparable energy. In this paper, the problem of sensing and communicating parallel sources is studied by accounting for the cost of both communication and sensing. In the first formulation of the problem, the sensor has a separate energy budget for sensing and a rate budget for communication, while, in the second, it has a single energy budget for both tasks. Furthermore, in the second problem, each source has its own associated channel. Assuming that sources with larger variances have lower sensing costs, the optimal allocation of sensing energy and rate that minimizes the overall distortion is derived for the first problem. Moreover, structural results on the solution of the second problem are derived under the assumption that the sources with larger variances are transmitted on channels with lower noise.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1345","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283478.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient sensing and communication of parallel Gaussian sources","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Joints","Resource management","Noise","Wireless sensor networks","Energy measurement","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Gaussian processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient sensing process","parallel Gaussian sources communication","wireless sensor networks","single energy budget","sensing energy optimal allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient sensing and communication of parallel Gaussian sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283478/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283478/","accessionNumber":"12962862","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient sensing and communication of parallel Gaussian sources","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1341liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059647S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283480,"authors":[{"name":"Omur Ozel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Omur","lastName":"Ozel","id":"37400338000"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283480","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":807},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283480","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Transmitters","Entropy","Energy harvesting","Receivers","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","energy harvesting","entropy","radio networks","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy state amplification scheme","energy harvesting communication system","exogenous energy arrival process","energy harvesting transmitter","state-dependent channels","causal state information","information transmission blurs","receiver","received signal","entropy reduction","AWGN channel","Shannon strategy","unlimited battery","random binning schemes","best-effort-transmit binning schemes","Gaussian codebook","average recharge rate","wireless networking"]}],"abstract":"In energy harvesting communication systems, the energy required for message transmission is maintained by an exogenous energy arrival process independent of the message. This links the problem of communication with an energy harvesting transmitter to the problem of communication over state-dependent channels. In particular, if the transmitter has no battery, the available energy can be viewed as a state and the resulting channel is a state-dependent channel with causal state information at the transmitter only. In general, information transmission blurs the state information that the receiver can get from the received signal. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between the information rate R and the entropy reduction of the energy arrival process \u0394 at the receiver side over an AWGN channel with an energy harvesting transmitter. If the transmitter has no battery, the trade-off points are achieved by Shannon strategies and we show that the optimal input distributions are discrete. Next, we consider the state amplification problem for an energy harvesting transmitter with an unlimited battery. We show that the optimal trade-off region in this extreme case is expressed explicitly in a simple form and its boundary is achieved by a combination of best-effort-transmit and random binning schemes with an i.i.d. Gaussian codebook of average power equal to the average recharge rate. Finally, we propose an uncoded state amplification scheme that splits the energy between message transmission and entropy reduction and study its performance in a numerical example.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283480","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283480.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1355","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy state amplification in an energy harvesting communication system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy state amplification in an energy harvesting communication system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283480/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962864","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283480/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy state amplification in an energy harvesting communication system","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1351ozel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041134S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283481,"authors":[{"name":"Lav R.

Motivation for this study comes from the application of using cheap measurement devices installed on personal cellphones to monitor environmental parameters such as air pollution, temperature and noise level. Our model resembles the MAC model of Nazer and Gastpar except that the encoders are restricted to be CDMA encoders. Unlike the work of Nazer and Gastpar whose main attention is transmission of linear functions, we deal with non-linear functions with binary inputs. A main contribution of this paper is a lower bound on the computational capacity for this problem. While in the traditional CDMA system the signature matrix of the CDMA system preferably has independent rows, here the signature matrix of the CDMA system is viewed as the parity check matrix of a linear code, reflecting our treatment of the interference. We also introduce the problem of Slepian-Wolf compression with the same compression matrix.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283491.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1405","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission of non-linear binary input functions over a CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Receivers","Noise","Parity check codes","Decoding","Vectors","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","code division multiple access","data compression","linear codes","matrix algebra","mobile handsets","mobile radio","network coding","parity check codes","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear binary input function transmission","CDMA system","mobile network","cheap measurement devices","personal cell phones","air pollution","noise level","environmental parameter monitoring","MAC model","encoders","CDMA encoders","linear function transmission","compression matrix","interference","parity check matrix codes","linear code","signature matrix","lower bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Transmission of non-linear binary input functions over a CDMA system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283491/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962875","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission of non-linear binary input functions over a CDMA system","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1401mohammadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115997S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283500,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryota","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37888745200"},{"name":"Hideki Ochiai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37269532900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283500","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can achieve remarkable performance in terms of spectral efficiency. However, its well-known drawback is that the OFDM signals have high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and this causes performance degradation in terms of power amplifier (PA) efficiency. Trellis shaping (TS) is an effective method to reduce PAPR without signal distortion by exploiting the trellis structure at the transmitter. In practice, OFDM should be combined with channel coding in order to achieve frequency diversity. In this paper, we propose a serial concatenation of channel coding and trellis shaping such that the frequency diversity effect and peak power reduction can be simultaneously achieved. A novel BCJR-based LLR metric calculation for trellis shaping bits is introduced for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by simulation over AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283500.pdf","startPage":"1435","endPage":"1439","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A serial concatenation of coding and trellis shaping for OFDM systems with peak power reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Measurement","Parity check codes","Channel coding","Fading","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","concatenated codes","fading channels","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serial concatenation code","trellis shaping codes","OFDM systems","peak power reduction","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","spectral efficiency","high peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","power amplifier","PA efficiency","channel coding","signal distortion","transmitter","trellis structure","frequency diversity effect","BCJR-based LLR metric","AWGN channel","frequency-selective fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A serial concatenation of coding and trellis shaping for OFDM systems with peak power reduction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962884","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A serial concatenation of coding and trellis shaping for OFDM systems with peak power reduction","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1435yoshizawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056552S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283504,"authors":[{"name":"Yiming Chen","affiliation":["Western Digital Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Chen","id":"38469226100"},{"name":"Shayan Garani Srinivasa","affiliation":["Western Digital Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shayan Garani","lastName":"Srinivasa","id":"37301557600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283504","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"abstract":"We develop several novel signal detection algorithms for two-dimensional intersymbol-interference channels.

The parameter that captures this notion is called update-efficiency. In this paper we study update-efficient error-correcting codes and develop their basic properties. While update-efficiency and error-correction are two conflicting objectives, we deduce conditions for existence of such codes. In particular, logarithmically growing update-efficiency is achievable with a capacity-achieving linear code in both binary symmetric and binary erasure channels. On the other hand we show a tight converse result. Our result implies that it is not possible to have a capacity-achieving code in binary symmetric channel that has sub-logarithmic update-efficiency. This is true in the case of the binary erasure channel as well for linear codes. We also discuss a number of questions related to update-efficient adversarial error-correcting codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Update efficient codes for error correction","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283534","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283534.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Update efficient codes for error correction","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283534/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962910","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Update efficient codes for error correction","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1558mazumdar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053895S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6283538,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe Cinelli Barbosa","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Felipe Cinelli","lastName":"Barbosa","id":"38231899600"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Kliewer","affiliation":["Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, NM, USA"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Kliewer","id":"37271357600"},{"name":"Max H.

We show that code concatenation preserves the nested properties of codes and that only one of the concatenated codes needs to be nested, which opens up a wide range of possible new code combinations for these side information based problems. In particular, the practically important binary version of these problems can be addressed by concatenating binary inner and non-binary outer linear codes. By observing that list decoding with folded Reed-Solomon codes is asymptotically optimal for encoding IID q-ary sources and that in concatenation with inner binary codes it can asymptotically achieve the rate-distortion bound for a Bernoulli symmetric source, we illustrate our findings with a new algebraic construction which comprises concatenated nested cyclic codes and binary linear block codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283538/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962914","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An algebraic framework for concatenated linear block codes in side information based problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algebraic framework for concatenated linear block codes in side information based problems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1573barbosa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062467S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283546,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongho Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jeongho","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37712140700"},{"name":"Anthony Ephremides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ephremides","id":"37265761500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283546","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283546","abstract":"In this work, we consider a system with time-varying channels and random access that exploits the channel state information (CSI).

RACS relies on integrating sensing with the communication architecture, in order to achieve overall efficiency in terms of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered to the fusion center. Targeting realistic deployment conditions, we consider data gathering over a Ricean fading channel and in the presence of communication noise. We provide a framework for system design and study the energy and bandwidth requirements of the network. We then show that compared to a conventional TDMA network with ARQ, RACS achieves significant energy and bandwidth savings. For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we observe 10 dB gain in the energy as well as a 2.5-fold reduction in the required bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283548.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1617","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random access compressed sensing over fading and noisy communication channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Sensors","Bandwidth","Compressed sensing","Interference","Encoding","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","fading channels","telemetry","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access compressed sensing","fading channels","noisy communication channels","data telemetry","distributed sensors","fusion center","Ricean fading channel","communication noise","time division multiple access","TDMA network","automatic repeat request","ARQ","RACS","gain 10 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Random access compressed sensing over fading and noisy communication channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283548/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962924","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random access compressed sensing over fading and noisy communication channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1613fazel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05572S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283553,"authors":[{"name":"Yihong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA","Department of Statistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539907300"},{"name":"Sergio Verdu\u00b4","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verdu\u00b4"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283553","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Decoding","Compressed sensing","Encoding","Noise measurement","Sensitivity","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","compressed sensing","linear codes","nonlinear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal phase transitions","compressed sensing","noisy measurements","analog signals efficient recovery","linear encodings","random process","encoders","optimal linear encoders","random linear encoders","optimal nonlinear encoders","noise sensitivity","reconstruction fidelity","optimal phase-transition threshold","input distribution","suboptimal thresholds","popular reconstruction algorithms","Gaussian sensing matrices","phase-transition threshold","optimal nonlinear encoding","weak-noise regime","replica heuristics"]}],"abstract":"Compressed sensing deals with efficient recovery of analog signals from linear encodings. This paper presents a statistical study of compressed sensing by modeling the input signal as an i.i.d. random process. Three classes of encoders are considered, namely, optimal nonlinear, optimal linear and random linear encoders. Focusing on optimal decoders, we investigate the fundamental tradeoff between measurement rate and reconstruction fidelity gauged by the noise sensitivity. The optimal phase-transition threshold is determined as a functional of the input distribution and compared to suboptimal thresholds achieved by popular reconstruction algorithms. In particular, we show that Gaussian sensing matrices incur no penalty on the phase-transition threshold with respect to optimal nonlinear encoding.

An asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression and the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for the system are derived employing novel techniques from large dimensional random matrix theory (RMT). The asymptotic regime is based on the assumption that the numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver approach to infinity with a fixed ratio. Our contributions are to extend the previous results to the general channel model with two-sided spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), in which the transmit and receive correlation matrices are both generally nonnegative definite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian distributed. Simulations show that the asymptotic capacity is accurate even for finite number of antenna and invariant to all types of fading distribution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283568.pdf","startPage":"1707","endPage":"1711","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On asymptotic capacity of coordinated multi-point MIMO channels with spatial correlation and LOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mutual information","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Antennas","Fading","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","receiving antennas","telecommunication channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic capacity","coordinated multipoint MIMO channels","LOS","CoMP","input multiple multiple-output system","multiple base stations","multiple users","multiple antennas","asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression","capacity-achieving input covariance matrices","large dimensional random matrix theory","RMT","transmitter","receiver","two-sided spatial correlation","line-of-sight","channel entries","antenna finite number","fading distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"On asymptotic capacity of coordinated multi-point MIMO channels with spatial correlation and LOS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962944","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On asymptotic capacity of coordinated multi-point MIMO channels with spatial correlation and LOS","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1707zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057988S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283569,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Klappenecker","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Klappenecker","id":"37283999600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283569","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additives","Error correction codes","Indexes","Vectors","Kernel","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","quantum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nice nearrings","quantum information processing","quantum error-correcting codes","generalized Pauli basis","nice error bases","finite nearfields","finite ring","finite Frobenius ring"]}],"abstract":"Nice error bases are a fundamental primitive of quantum information processing.

The capacity-achieving input signal, which we refer to as Beta-variate space-time modulation (BSTM), turns out to be the product of a unitary isotropically distributed random matrix, and a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are distributed as the square-root of the eigenvalues of a Beta-distributed random matrix of appropriate size. Numerical results illustrate that using BSTM instead of USTM in large-MIMO systems yields a rate gain as large as 13% for SNR values of practical interest.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283571","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283571.pdf","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary isotropically distributed inputs are not capacity-achieving for large-MIMO fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283571/","displayDocTitle":"Unitary isotropically distributed inputs are not capacity-achieving for large-MIMO fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962947","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283571/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary isotropically distributed inputs are not capacity-achieving for large-MIMO fading channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1717yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098347S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283573,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Yona","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Yona","id":"37546638600"},{"name":"Meir Feder","affiliation":["Department of EE-Systems, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Meir","lastName":"Feder","id":"37284132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283573","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Sum product algorithm","Approximation algorithms","Equations","Mathematical model","Channel capacity","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density lattice codes","maximum-likelihood lattice decoding","Euclidean space","continuous channels","factor graph","additive white Gaussian noise channel","sum-product algorithms","max-product algorithms","word error rate"]}],"abstract":"A max-product algorithm for approximating maximum-likelihood lattice decoding of low density lattice codes is derived, operating directly in the Euclidean space.

Since nonzero elements are mainly in lower triangular entries of the sparse inverse generator matrix of SC-LDLC, iterative encoding with the Gauss-Seidel method performs well. The convergence speed of iterative encoding is evaluated by both the mean square error (MSE) and the symbol error rate between a given integer vector b and the inversely generated integer vector from the codeword of b. Numerical experiments show that the convergence of encoding for SC-LDLC is 3 times faster than that of the conventional LDLC, at an MSE of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>\n for dimension n = 10000.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Convergence","Encoding","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Jacobian matrices","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","decoding","iterative decoding","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative encoding","Gauss-Seidel method","spatially-coupled low-density lattice codes","SC-LDLC","decoding performance","noncoupled LDLC lattices","encoding complexity","triangular entries","sparse inverse generator matrix","mean square error","MSE","symbol error rate","integer vector","encoding convergence","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283575","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1741","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283575.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative encoding with Gauss-Seidel method for spatially-coupled low-density lattice codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Iterative encoding with Gauss-Seidel method for spatially-coupled low-density lattice codes","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12962951","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283575/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative encoding with Gauss-Seidel method for spatially-coupled low-density lattice codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1737uchikawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061521S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283579,"authors":[{"name":"Megasthenis Asteris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Megasthenis","lastName":"Asteris","id":"37888245600"},{"name":"Alexandros G.

Although this is impossible if we require the code to be MDS, we show it can be achieved if we relax our requirement into a near-MDS property. More concretely, for any e we construct codes that guarantee that a random subset of (1 + \u03b5)k symbols suffices to recover the original symbols with high probability. Our codes produce an unbounded number of output symbols, creating each parity independently by linearly combining a logarithmic number of input symbols. This structure has the additional benefit of logarithmic locality: a single symbol loss can be repaired by accessing only 0(log k) other coded symbols. This is a desired property for distributed storage systems where symbols are spread over a network of storage nodes. Our mathematical contribution involves analyzing the rank of sparse random matrices over finite fields. We rely on establishing that a new family of sparse random bipartite graphs have large matchings with high probability.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283579","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283579.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repairable Fountain codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Repairable Fountain codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283579/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962955","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283579/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repairable Fountain codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1752asteris.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063886S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283581,"authors":[{"name":"Birgit Schotsch","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Birgit","lastName":"Schotsch","id":"37394028600"},{"name":"Radu Lupoaie","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Systems and Data Processing, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Lupoaie","id":"37891864100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283581","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283581","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Vectors","Educational institutions","Color","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Galois fields","maximum likelihood decoding","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite length LT codes","unequal error protection","input nodes biased sampling","higher order Galois fields","maximum likelihood decoding","biased sampling method","LT code graph","symbol erasure probability"]}],"abstract":"Finite length LT codes over higher order Galois fields F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</sub>\n for unequal error protection (UEP) are analysed under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding.

We first study the effect of the secondary nodes' transmission parameters such as power and channel access probabilities on the stable throughput of the primary node. If the sensing is perfect, then the secondary nodes do not interfere with the primary node and thus do not affect its stable throughput. In case of imperfect sensing, it is shown that if the primary node's arrival rate is less than some calculated value, then the secondary transmissions do not affect its queueing stability; otherwise, the secondary nodes should regulate their transmission parameters to reduce their interference on the primary. Finally, we propose a multinode relaying protocol based on distributed space-time orthogonal block codes, that uses the secondary nodes as relays of the primary node's traffic to compensate for the interference they might cause. In this case, for appropriate modulation scheme and under perfect sensing, it is shown that the more secondary nodes in the system, the better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput. Meanwhile, the secondary nodes might benefit from relaying by having access to a larger number of idle slots becoming available to them due to the increase of the service rate of the primary.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1807","endPage":"1811","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283591.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of secondary nodes on the primary's stable throughput in a cognitive wireless network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283591/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of secondary nodes on the primary's stable throughput in a cognitive wireless network","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962967","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of secondary nodes on the primary's stable throughput in a cognitive wireless network","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1807fanous.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051251S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283597,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Lam Chan","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chun Lam","lastName":"Chan","id":"38240634100"},{"name":"Sidharth Jaggi","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sidharth","lastName":"Jaggi","id":"37283939600"},{"name":"Venkatesh Saligrama","affiliation":["Boston University, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Saligrama","id":"37301183700"},{"name":"Samar Agnihotri","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Samar","lastName":"Agnihotri","id":"37424487000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283597","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Noise measurement","Decoding","Testing","Noise","Algorithm design and analysis","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group theory","information theory","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonadaptive group testing","bounds algorithms","novel algorithms","near-optimal sample-complexity","CBP via linear programming","NCBP-LP","Noisy CBP-LP","NCBP-SLP+","NCBP-SLP-","information theoretic bounds"]}],"abstract":"We present computationally efficient and provably correct algorithms with near-optimal sample-complexity for noisy non-adaptive group testing.

Our noisy scenario accounts for both false negatives and false positives for the test outcomes. Inspired by compressive sensing algorithms we introduce four novel computationally efficient decoding algorithms for group testing, CBP via Linear Programming (CBP-LP), NCBP-LP (Noisy CBP-LP), and the two related algorithms NCBP-SLP+ and NCBP-SLP- (\u201cSimple\u201d NCBP-LP). The first of these algorithms deals with the noiseless measurement scenario, and the next three with the noisy measurement scenario.

The proof technique is based on a polar code martingale argument and on a new entropy power inequality for integer-valued random variables.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sensing using deterministic partial Hadamard matrices","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283598","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283598.pdf","startPage":"1842","endPage":"1846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sensing using deterministic partial Hadamard matrices","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283598/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sensing using deterministic partial Hadamard matrices","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1842haghighatshoar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067603S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283601,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Jafarpour","affiliation":["Multimedia Research Group, Yahoo Research, USA"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Jafarpour","id":"37296626500"},{"name":"Marco F.

In coding theory, decoders that can correct beyond the minimum distance of a code allow random codes to achieve the Shannon limit. In compressed sensing, the counterpart of minimum distance is the spark of the measurement matrix, i.e., the size of the smallest set of linearly dependent columns. This paper constructs a family of measurement matrices where the columns are formed by exponentiating codewords from a classical binary error-correcting code of block length M. The columns can be partitioned into mutually unbiased bases, and the spark of the corresponding measurement matrix is shown to be O(\u221aM) by identifying a configuration of columns that plays a role similar to that of the Dirac comb in classical Fourier analysis. Further, an explicit basis for the null space of these measurement matrices is given in terms of indicator functions of binary self-dual codes. Reliable reconstruction of k-sparse inputs is shown for k of order M/log(M) which is best possible and far beyond the worst case lower bound provided by the spark.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283601","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond worst-case reconstruction in deterministic compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Beyond worst-case reconstruction in deterministic compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283601/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962977","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283601/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond worst-case reconstruction in deterministic compressed sensing","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1852jafarpour.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085762S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283603,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Zhou","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, FEIT University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38004326200"},{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, FEIT University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37269935500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283603","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) and 1-bit CS cannot directly recover quantized signals preferred in digital systems and require time consuming recovery. In this paper, we introduce 1-bit Hamming compressed sensing (HCS) that directly recovers a k-bit quantized signal of dimension n from its 1-bit measurements via invoking n times of Kullback-Leibler divergence based nearest neighbor search. Compared to CS and 1-bit CS, 1-bit HCS allows the signal to be dense, takes considerably less (linear and non-iterative) recovery time and requires substantially less measurements. Moreover, 1-bit HCS can accelerate 1bit CS recover. We study a quantized recovery error bound of 1-bit HCS for general signals. Extensive numerical simulations verify the appealing accuracy, robustness, efficiency and consistency of 1-bit HCS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283603.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1866","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1-bit Hamming compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Compressed sensing","Estimation","Upper bound","Digital systems","Nearest neighbor searches","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1-bit Hamming compressed sensing","digital system","time consuming recovery","quantized signal","Kullback-Leibler divergence","nearest neighbor search","1-bit HCS","linear recovery time","noniterative recovery time","quantized recovery error bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"1-bit Hamming compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12962979","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1-bit Hamming compressed sensing","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1862zhou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080558S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6283604,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Ramirez-Javega","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communications Group, Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Ramirez-Javega","id":"38328513400"},{"name":"Meritxell Lamarca","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communications Group, Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Meritxell","lastName":"Lamarca","id":"37266547500"},{"name":"Javier Villares","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communications Group, Department of Signal Theory and Communications (TSC), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Villares","id":"37269546000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283604","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Decoding","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Computational complexity","Equations","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","decoding","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary graphs","message passing strategies","compressed sensing","noiseless setting","operating computational complexity","matrix structure","decoding","message passing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We propose a scheme for Compressed Sensing in the noiseless setting that reconstructs the original signal operating on a binary graph where the samples are obtained sequentially.

Although, there exist efficient sub-optimal decoders with reduced complexity for polar codes, the complexity of the optimum ML decoder increases exponentially. Hence the optimum decoder is infeasible for the practical implementation of polar coding. In this paper, our motivation is about developing efficient ML decoder with reduced complexity. In this purpose, polar code based sphere decoding algorithm is proposed with the optimal performance. Additionally, proposed technique exploits two properties of polar coding to reduce decoding complexity. By this way, the reduced complexity of optimal decoding is only cubic, not exponential.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Encoding","Maximum likelihood estimation","Binary phase shift keying","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code based efficient maximum-likelihood decoding","short polar codes","code construction","Shannon capacity","arbitrary symmetric binary-input channels","sub-optimal decoders","optimum ML decoder","polar coding","sphere decoding algorithm","decoding complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ML estimation","Polar codes","Reed-Muller codes","Sphere Decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283643","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283643","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283643","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code based efficient maximum-likelihood decoding of short polar codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Code based efficient maximum-likelihood decoding of short polar codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283643/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283643/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code based efficient maximum-likelihood decoding of short polar codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p1967kahraman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064692S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6283644,"authors":[{"name":"David Burshtein","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Burshtein","id":"37272732600"},{"name":"Alona Strugatski","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Alona","lastName":"Strugatski","id":"38469303000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283644","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Decoding","Complexity theory","Source coding","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar write once memory codes","coding scheme","noiseless write once memory","capacity region","arbitrary number","multiple writes","encoding complexities scale","decoding complexities scale","error probability","finite length codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283644","abstract":"A coding scheme for write once memory (WOM) using polar codes is presented.

We are interested in testing the null hypothesis that both the strings were drawn from the same distribution, assuming that the samples within each string are mutually independent. Among statisticians, the most popular solution for such a homogeneity test is the two sample chi-square test, primarily due to its ease of implementation and the fact that the limiting null hypothesis distribution of the associated test statistic is known and easy to compute. Although tests that are asymptotically optimal in error probability have been proposed in the information theory literature, such optimality results are not well-known and such tests are rarely used in practice. In this paper we seek to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We study two different optimal tests proposed by Shayevitz [1] and Gutman [2]. We first obtain a simplified structure of Shayevitz's test and then obtain limiting distributions of the test statistics used in both the tests. These results provide guidelines for choosing thresholds that guarantee an approximate false alarm constraint for finite length observation sequences, thus making these tests easy to use in practice. The approximation accuracies are demonstrated using simulations. We argue that such homogeneity tests with provable optimality properties could potentially be better choices than the chi-square test in practice.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283716","startPage":"2027","endPage":"2031","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283716.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal two sample homogeneity tests for finite alphabets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"On optimal two sample homogeneity tests for finite alphabets","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283716/","accessionNumber":"12963015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal two sample homogeneity tests for finite alphabets","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2027unnikrishnan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042786S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283717,"authors":[{"name":"Samet Oymak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samet","lastName":"Oymak","id":"37571652800"},{"name":"M.

In this paper we give a simple closed form expression for the minimum number of measurements required for successful recovery when the optimal weights are chosen. The formula shows that the number of measurements is upper bounded by the sum of the minimum number of measurements needed had we measured the S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n components of the signal separately. In fact, our results indicate that this upper bound is tight and we actually have equality.

In several such scenarios, interference alignment was used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise ratios. The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these results by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize capacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real time-invariant frequency-flat X-channels, for which only the degrees-of-freedom are known. We propose a new communication scheme and show that it achieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To aid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model, admitting a wider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian channel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal communication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic channel to the original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity to within a constant gap. This is the first constant-gap result for a fully-connected network requiring interference alignment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283727.pdf","startPage":"2077","endPage":"2081","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment: From degrees-of-freedom to constant-gap capacity approximations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Approximation methods","Transmitters","Channel models","Interference channels","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","constant-gap capacity approximations","multiple interfering links","degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations","finite signal-to-noise ratios","channel capacity behavior","time-invariant frequency-flat X-channels","Gaussian X-channel","deterministic channel model","Gaussian channel","optimal communication scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment: From degrees-of-freedom to constant-gap capacity approximations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963026","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment: From degrees-of-freedom to constant-gap capacity approximations","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2077niesen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057319S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283728,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Sun","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Sun","id":"38469211200"},{"name":"Chunhua Geng","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Geng","id":"37587698200"},{"name":"Tiangao Gou","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tiangao","lastName":"Gou","id":"37393365000"},{"name":"Syed A.

The previously known best general DoF inner bound, inspired by the K user interference channel, was based on the decomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna nodes, transforming the network into an AM \u00d7 AN user SISO X network. While such a decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user interference channel, a gap remained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel. Here we close this gap with the new insight that the MIMO X network is only one-sided decomposable, i.e., either all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not both) can be decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple single antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended to SIMO and MISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF results satisfy the spatial scale invariance property. In addition, the feasibility of linear interference alignment is investigated based only on spatial beamforming without symbol extensions.

In this paper, we derive the closed-form expressions for the Gallager's random coding and expurgated error exponents for Rayleigh fading product multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels under the assumption that there is no channel-state information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the receiver. From the derived analytical expressions, we get insight into an elementary tradeoff between the communication reliability and information rate for the Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels. Moreover, we can easily compute the necessary codeword length without the extensive Monte-carlo simulation to achieve predefined error probability at a given rate below the channel capacity. In addition, we derive the exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity and cutoff rate based on easily computable Meijer G-function. The closed-form expressions for the error exponents, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate have also been derived for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channels as the example of special case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283835/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283835/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963046","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Error exponents for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error exponents for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2166xue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065479S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6283836,"authors":[{"name":"Dushyantha A.

In this scenario, little is known about channel capacity since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity MIMO system with arbitrary numbers of sources and antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute a compact approximation to ergodic sum capacity, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we develop a highly simplified upper-bound which leads to insights into the relationship between capacity and the channel powers.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283836","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283836.pdf","startPage":"2171","endPage":"2175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic sum capacity of macrodiversity MIMO systems in flat Rayleigh fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283836/","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic sum capacity of macrodiversity MIMO systems in flat Rayleigh fading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963047","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283836/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic sum capacity of macrodiversity MIMO systems in flat Rayleigh fading","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2171basnayaka.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062192S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283838,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Hoydis","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Hoydis","id":"37573341600"},{"name":"Romain Couillet","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Couillet","id":"37546137300"},{"name":"Pablo Piantanida","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Piantanida","id":"37293979700"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, SUPELEC, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283838","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error probability","Approximation methods","MIMO","Upper bound","Fading","Channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","encoding","error statistics","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO Rayleigh fading channel","random matrix","finite blocklength regime","central limit theorem","information density","white Gaussian inputs","data blocklength","transmit antennas","receive antennas","closed-form upper bounds","error probability","input-constrained version","Feinstein lemma","second-order approximation","coding rate"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides a novel central limit theorem (CLT) for the information density of the MIMO Rayleigh fading channel under white Gaussian inputs, when the data blocklength n and the number of transmit and receive antennas K and N, respectively, are large but of similar order of magnitude.

The objective is to minimize the length of a codeword broadcasted to all receivers which allows each receiver to learn its character. For linear index coding, the minimum possible length is known to be equal to the minrank parameter. In this paper we initiate the study of the typical minimum length of a linear index code for the random graph G(n, p) over a field F. First, we prove that for every constant size field F and a constant p, the minimum length of a linear index code for G(n, p) over F is almost surely \u03a9(\u221an). Second, we introduce and study two special models of index coding and study their typical minimum length: Locally decodable index codes in which the receivers are required to query at most q characters from the encoded message (such codes naturally correspond to efficient decoding); and low density index codes in which every character of the broadcasted word affects at most q characters in the encoded message (such codes naturally correspond to efficient encoding procedures). We present enhanced results for these special models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283850.pdf","startPage":"2231","endPage":"2235","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On linear index coding for random graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Vectors","Receivers","Generators","Channel coding","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","random codes","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear index coding","random graphs","index coding problem","receivers","codeword","minrank parameter","locally decodable index codes","encoded message","low density index codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"On linear index coding for random graphs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963061","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On linear index coding for random graphs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2231haviv.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122118S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283852,"authors":[{"name":"Son Hoang Dau","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physics and Mathematics Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Son Hoang","lastName":"Dau","id":"37683572000"},{"name":"Vitaly Skachek","affiliation":["Department of ECE, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Vitaly","lastName":"Skachek","id":"37283170200"},{"name":"Yeow Meng Chee","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physics and Mathematics Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yeow Meng","lastName":"Chee","id":"37286804400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283852","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Channel coding","Color","Educational institutions","Polynomials","Cloning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","encoding","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digraph","optimal scalar linear solution","index coding","side information","near-extreme min-ranks","near-extreme transmission rates","optimal scalar linear index codes","NP-complete","polynomial time"]}],"abstract":"The min-rank of a digraph was shown by Bar-Yossef et al.

By contrast, the same question for graphs can be answered in polynomial time.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283852","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283852.pdf","startPage":"2241","endPage":"2245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal index codes with near-extreme rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283852/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal index codes with near-extreme rates","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963063","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283852/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal index codes with near-extreme rates","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2241dau.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059106S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283853,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Saber Tehrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arash Saber","lastName":"Tehrani","id":"37603807700"},{"name":"Alexandros G.

For this problem we introduce a novel coding scheme called partition multicast. Our scheme can be seen as a natural generalization of clique cover for directed index coding problems. Further, partition multicast corresponds to an achievable scheme for the generalized bipartite index coding problem that we introduce in this paper. Our scheme partitions the nodes into groups and solves a multicasting problem within each group. We show that Partition Multicast is optimal for a few families of graphs and generalizes previous achievable schemes, namely directed cycle covers. We also show that finding the best partition is computationally intractable to compute in general.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipartite index coding","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283853","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283853.pdf","startPage":"2246","endPage":"2250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Bipartite index coding","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283853/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963064","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipartite index coding","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2246sabertehrani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07478S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283916,"authors":[{"name":"Fangfang Zhu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Fangfang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37405202100"},{"name":"Biao Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283916","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Markov processes","Receivers","Mutual information","Integrated circuits","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete memoryless interference channel","one-sided weak interference","mixed interference","Gaussian Z-interference channel","transceiver pair","single user detection","unintended receiver","discrete degraded interference channels","degraded broadcast channels"]}],"abstract":"The sum capacity of a class of discrete memoryless interference channels is determined. This class of channels is defined analogous to the Gaussian Z-interference channel with weak interference; as a result, the sum capacity is achieved by letting the transceiver pair subject to the interference communicates at a rate such that its message can be decoded at the unintended receiver using single user detection. Moreover, this class of discrete memoryless interference channels is equivalent in capacity region to certain discrete degraded interference channels. This allows the construction of a capacity outer-bound using the capacity region of associated degraded broadcast channels. The same technique is then used to determine the sum capacity of the discrete memoryless interference channel with mixed interference.

In this scenario, it is usually costly to acquire full channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), i.e., every transmitter perfectly knows the overall channel state information (CSI) of the network. Hence, we assume individual CSIT (I-CSIT), i.e., each transmitter only knows its own CSI. We propose a novel precoding technique, named Hermitian precoding, to enhance the system performance under the constraint of I-CSIT. We show that the proposed scheme can perform close to the system capacity with full CSIT. This reveals that the amount of CSI required at the transmitters can be significantly reduced without considerably compromising performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283918","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hermitian precoding for distributed MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hermitian precoding for distributed MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283918/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963072","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hermitian precoding for distributed MIMO systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2281zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062801S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283919,"authors":[{"name":"Mari Kobayashi","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37290906700"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire","id":"37267243200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283919","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Training","Transmitters","Downlink","Vectors","Channel estimation","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcast channels","channel coding","channel estimation","fading channels","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","time-varying channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DoF","time-varying MISO broadcast channels","linear precoding strategy","zero-forcing beamforming","MAT scheme","ZF beamforming","temporally correlated fading process","band-limited Doppler spectrum","optimal degrees of freedom","delayed channel state information at transmitter","CSIT","fading Doppler bandwidth","downlink channel estimation","receiver","channel block length","transmit antennas","Maddah-Ali and Tse strategy"]}],"abstract":"We compare two classes of linear precoding strategies, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the \u201cMAT\u201d scheme recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse, over time-varying MISO broadcast channels. For a temporally correlated fading process with band-limited Doppler spectrum in [-F, F], with 0 \u2264 F <; 1/2, it has been shown that ZF achieves a fraction 1-2F of the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF). On the other hand, MAT exploits delayed channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) and guarantees a constant DoF irrespectively of the fading Doppler bandwidth. In this work, we compare the net DoFs of both schemes by accounting for the correlation between fading blocks and for the resource required for downlink channel estimation. It is found that the downlink training for each receiver to learn the CSI of the others might be detrimental for the performance of MAT especially when the system size (number of users and transmit antennas) is not much smaller than the channel block length.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283919","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283919.pdf","startPage":"2286","endPage":"2290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the net DoF comparison between ZF and MAT over time-varying MISO broadcast channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283919/","displayDocTitle":"On the net DoF comparison between ZF and MAT over time-varying MISO broadcast channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963073","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283919/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the net DoF comparison between ZF and MAT over time-varying MISO broadcast channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2286kobayashi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045191S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283920,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shuiyin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37072288400"},{"name":"Cong Ling","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Ling","id":"37275770000"},{"name":"Xiaofu Wu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293518500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283920","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Vectors","Decoding","Complexity theory","Silicon carbide","MIMO","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast antennas","decoding","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proximity factors","lattice reduction-aided precoding","multiantenna broadcast","lattice precoding","closest vector problem","\u03b7-CVP","sphere precoding","decoding","boundary effect","finite constellation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283920","abstract":"Lattice precoding is an effective strategy for multiantenna broadcast.

Several interesting properties of these precoders are revealed by this analysis.

The concept behind the proposed technique builds on the fact that both the desired and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of the downlink system itself. Based on this observation, the proposed method influences the resulting interference, to reduce the transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the information content of the downlink message. The aim is to bring the interference closer to the replicas of the desired symbols for all users in the THP modulo-extended constellation. In this way, the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased. Theoretical and simulation results both confirm that, by optimizing the interference to be canceled, the proposed technique offers a considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional THP while securing an equal error rate performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283923.pdf","startPage":"2301","endPage":"2305","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transmit-power efficient MIMO-THP design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Modulation","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit-power efficient MIMO-THP design","multiple input multiple output Tomlinson-Harashima precoder","transmit power loss","interfering signals","base station","downlink system","transmission power","information content","downlink message","THP modulo-extended constellation","pre-subtract interference","transmit power reduction","error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","power loss","known interference","multi-user MIMO","non-linear precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A transmit-power efficient MIMO-THP design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283923/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963077","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transmit-power efficient MIMO-THP design","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2301masouros.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059395S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283927,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Perfect secrecy is achieved when the transmitter and the legitimate receiver can communicate at some positive rate, while ensuring that the eavesdropper gets zero bits of information. In this paper, the perfect secrecy rate of the multiple antenna MIMO wiretap channel is maximized for arbitrary numbers of antennas under the assumption that the transmitter performs beamforming based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). More precisely, the optimal allocation of power for the GSVD-based precoder that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is derived.

While a powerful as well as an insightful concept, their full potential as a designing tool for LDPC code ensembles has not been realized due to some missing steps. This papers aims at filling these gaps by proving some important properties of GEXIT charts and using them to design capacity-approaching LDPC code ensembles. The primary results on GEXIT charts are limited to regular variable and check node degrees. Moreover, variable node GEXIT curves have only been derived for the case where no physical channel is present. In a recent paper, GEXIT curves for irregular variable node and check node degree distributions have been derived. In this paper, we derive GEXIT charts of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels with any channel parameter. For the case of binary symmetric channel, we derive closed form expression for the GEXIT curve of variable nodes. We also propose to use an alternative representation of GEXIT charts in which we plot the inverse of variable node GEXIT curve together with dual GEXIT curve of the check node. We prove that the area theorem still holds in this case. Using these results, we analyze and design capacity-approaching LDPC codes using GEXIT charts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Equations","Mathematical model","Memoryless systems","Computers","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memoryless systems","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized EXIT chart","generalized extrinsic information transfer chart","LDPC code","binary input output symmetric memoryless channels","low density parity check code","channel parameter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283930","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283930","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283930","startPage":"2336","endPage":"2340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Generalized EXIT charts of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Generalized EXIT charts of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283930/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283930/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963084","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Generalized EXIT charts of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2336mamani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050538S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6283931,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Nozaki","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Nozaki","id":"37532603200"},{"name":"Kenta Kasai","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Kasai","id":"37283011200"},{"name":"Kohichi Sakaniwa","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohichi","lastName":"Sakaniwa","id":"37283009600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283931","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283931","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Error analysis","Polynomials","Error probability","Floors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error floors","generalized nonbinary LDPC codes","q-ary memoryless symmetric channels","decoding error rates","nonbinary low-density parity-check codes","general linear group","finite field","belief propagation decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we compare the decoding error rates in the error floors for non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the general linear group with those for non-binary LDPC codes over finite field transmitted over the q-ary memoryless symmetric channel under belief propagation decoding.

Feedforward codes perform better than recursive systematic.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283937","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283937.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best rate 1/2 convolutional codes for turbo equalization with severe ISI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Best rate 1/2 convolutional codes for turbo equalization with severe ISI","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283937/","accessionNumber":"12963091","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best rate 1/2 convolutional codes for turbo equalization with severe ISI","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2366anderson.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065288S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6283939,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai-A.

The problem is usually treated as two separate one-way channel estimation problems: User 1 sends deterministic pilots to assist user 2 in estimating the channel, and vice versa.

Finally, asymptotic analysis at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) are presented where it is found that the capacity is bounded at high-SNR and present a simple suboptimal scalar quantizer that is capacity achieving, without the need of any numerical optimization, as q \u2192 \u221e.

Unfortunately this approach is infeasible for large encoder memories or constellation sizes. Traditional TCM designs circumvent this problem by using a labeling that follows the set-partitioning principle and by performing an exhaustive search over the encoders. Therefore, traditional TCM schemes are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we study binary labelings for TCM and show how they can be grouped into classes, which considerably reduces the search space in a joint design. For the particular case of 8-ary modulation the search space for the labelings is reduced from 8! to 240. Using this classification, we formally prove that for any channel it is always possible to design a TCM system based on the binary-reflected Gray code with identical performance to the one proposed by Ungerboeck in 1982.

In this paper, we study a specific class of frames, known as discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes, and introduce the notion of systematic frames for this class. This is encouraged by application of systematic DFT codes in distributed source coding using DFT codes, a new application for frames. Studying their extreme eigenvalues, we show that, unlike DFT frames, systematic DFT frames are not necessarily tight. Then, we come up with conditions for which these frames can be tight. In either case, the best and worst systematic frames are established from reconstruction error point of view. Eigenvalues of DFT frames, and their subframes, play a pivotal role in this work.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283950","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283950.pdf","startPage":"2426","endPage":"2430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic DFT frames: Principle and eigenvalues structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Systematic DFT frames: Principle and eigenvalues structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283950/","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12963104","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283950/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic DFT frames: Principle and eigenvalues structure","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2426vaezi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054931S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283951,"authors":[{"name":"Adel Javanmard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Javanmard","id":"37890759700"},{"name":"Andrea Montanari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Statistics, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Montanari","id":"37283172800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283951","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Couplings","Compressed sensing","Vectors","Message passing","Standards","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","random codes","random processes","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theoretically optimal rate","random signal sampling scheme","frequency domain sparse support","Shannon scheme","signal reconstruction","Nyquist rate","time logarithmic factor","signal probabilistic model","spatial coupling idea","coding theory","Gabor coefficient"]}],"abstract":"We study the problem of sampling a random signal with sparse support in frequency domain. Shannon famously considered a scheme that instantaneously samples the signal at equispaced times. He proved that the signal can be reconstructed as long as the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth (Nyquist rate). Cand\u00e8s, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires instantaneous samples of the signal at random times. They proved that the signal can be uniquely and efficiently reconstructed, provided the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, times logarithmic factors. In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal, and a sampling scheme inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory. Namely, we propose to acquire non-instantaneous samples at random times. Mathematically, this is implemented by acquiring a small random subset of Gabor coefficients. We show empirically that this scheme achieves correct reconstruction as soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subsampling at information theoretically optimal rates","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283951","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283951.pdf","startPage":"2431","endPage":"2435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Subsampling at information theoretically optimal rates","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283951/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963105","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subsampling at information theoretically optimal rates","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2431javanmard.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06182S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283957,"authors":[{"name":"Sameh Sorour","affiliation":["The Edward S.

We then apply the generalized extremal inequality to characterize the capacity region of the N-user compound MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel when the N users exhibit a degradedness order similar to the two-user case.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283968","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283968.pdf","startPage":"2506","endPage":"2510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An extremal inequality and the capacity region of the degraded MIMO compound Gaussian broadcast channel with multiple users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283968/","displayDocTitle":"An extremal inequality and the capacity region of the degraded MIMO compound Gaussian broadcast channel with multiple users","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963122","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6283968/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extremal inequality and the capacity region of the degraded MIMO compound Gaussian broadcast channel with multiple users","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2506chong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072561S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283972,"authors":[{"name":"Dariush Divsalar","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dariush","lastName":"Divsalar","id":"37283389300"},{"name":"Lara Dolecek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Dolecek","id":"37295938100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283972","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Vectors","Charge carrier processes","Niobium","Frequency modulation","Hamming weight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph cover","nonbinary protograph LDPC codes","nonbinary graph based code","trapping set size","stopping set size","pseudo codeword weight","finite length"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel class of non-binary graph-based codes, built upon graph covers of non-binary protograph LDPC codes.

Using homomorphic encryption, Ostrovsky and Skeith proposed a computationally secure solution to this problem in 2005. However, their solution requires the server to send an answer of size O(mS log m) bits when m documents of S bits match the query, while a non-private query only requires mS bits. In this work we propose two new communication optimal constructions, both allowing a communication expansion factor (compared to a non-private query) asymptotically equal to 1 when m and S increase. More precisely, our first scheme requires m(S + O(log t)) bits (where t is the size of the database) and our second scheme m(S +C) where C is a constant depending on the chosen computational security level.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283979","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"2556","endPage":"2560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Private Stream Search at the same communication cost as a regular search: Role of LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Private Stream Search at the same communication cost as a regular search: Role of LDPC codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283979/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963133","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283979/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Private Stream Search at the same communication cost as a regular search: Role of LDPC codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2556finiasz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074321S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6283985,"authors":[{"name":"Dayu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dayu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534334200"},{"name":"Sean Meyn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Meyn","id":"37283030800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283985","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Testing","Information theory","Vocabulary","Approximation methods","Vectors","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","signal classification","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary classification","high dimensional sparse samples","generalized error exponent","length-n test sequence","training sequences","classification error","asymptotically consistent classifier","error decays","\u21132-norm based classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high-dimensional model","large deviations","classification","sparse sample","generalized error exponent"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283985","abstract":"The task of the binary classification problem is to determine which of two distributions has generated a length-n test sequence.

In this paper, we propose three OIA techniques: antenna selection-based OIA, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OIA, and vector-quantized (codebook-based) OIA. Then, their performance is analyzed in terms of user scaling law required to achieve KS degrees-of-freedom (DoF), where S(\u2264 M) denotes the number of simultaneously transmitting MSs per cell. As our main result, it is shown that the antenna selection-based OIA does not fundamentally change the user scaling required to achieve KS DoF if L is fixed, compared with the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IMAC case. In contrast, it is shown that the SVD-based OIA can greatly reduce the required user scaling to SNR\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(K-1) S-L+1</sup>\n through optimizing weight vectors at each MS. Furthermore, we show that the vector-quantized OIA can achieve the same user scaling as the SVD-based OIA case if the codebook size is beyond a certain value. For the vector-quantized OIA, we analyze a fundamental tradeoff between the quantization level (i.e., codebook size) and the required user scaling.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283996","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06283996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"2636","endPage":"2640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic interference alignment for MIMO IMAC: Effect of user scaling over degrees-of-freedom","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6283996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic interference alignment for MIMO IMAC: Effect of user scaling over degrees-of-freedom","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6283996/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963150","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6283996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic interference alignment for MIMO IMAC: Effect of user scaling over degrees-of-freedom","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2636yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059249S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6283996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6283997,"authors":[{"name":"Xuesong Wang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Limited, China"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38469208800"},{"name":"Yong-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Limited, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37715864700"},{"name":"Philipp Zhang","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Limited, China"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37629991600"},{"name":"Xiaotao Ren","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company, Limited, China"],"firstName":"Xiaotao","lastName":"Ren","id":"38269674700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6283997","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antennas","MIMO","Equations","Interference channels","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO cellular network","multiple input multiple output cellular network","enhanced relay aided interference alignment"]}],"abstract":"Interference alignment scheme for multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) cellular networks is discussed in this paper.

In order to tackle this problem the paper makes use of recent developments in free probability theory which allow to deal with complex-valued eigenvalue distributions of non-Hermitian matrices by means of quaternions.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284001","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","startPage":"2656","endPage":"2660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel modelling of MU-MIMO systems by quaternionic free probability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel modelling of MU-MIMO systems by quaternionic free probability","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284001/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963155","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284001/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel modelling of MU-MIMO systems by quaternionic free probability","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2656muller.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076186S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6284003,"authors":[{"name":"Roy D.

A positive answer for such a test is called a certificate for the optimality of a codeword. We present new certificates that are based on combinatorial characterization for local-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner codes. The certificate is based on weighted normalized trees in computation trees of the Tanner graph. These trees may have any finite height h (even greater than the girth of the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes are not restricted to two (i.e., skinny trees). We prove that local-optimality in this new characterization implies ML-optimality and LP-optimality, and show that a certificate can be computed efficiently. We apply the new local-optimality characterization to regular Tanner codes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds of LP-decoding in MBIOS channels. When the noise is below these lower bounds, the probability that LP-decoding fails decays doubly exponentially in the girth of the Tanner graph.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284007.pdf","startPage":"2686","endPage":"2690","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-programming decoding of Tanner codes with local-optimality certificates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation","Vectors","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","decoding","linear programming","probability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-programming decoding","local-optimality certificate","one-sided error test","channel observation","combinatorial characterization","codeword","weighted normalized tree","computation tree","Tanner graph","ML-optimality","LP-optimality","Tanner code","LP-decoding","MBIOS channel","probability","memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Linear-programming decoding of Tanner codes with local-optimality certificates","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963161","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-programming decoding of Tanner codes with local-optimality certificates","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2686halabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064199S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284009,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Yih Jian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Yung-Yih","lastName":"Jian","id":"37606235700"},{"name":"Henry D.

Our problem is a natural generalization of a homogenous storage allocation problem where all the nodes had the same reliability and is naturally motivated for peer-to-peer and cloud storage systems with different types of nodes. Assuming optimal erasure coding (MDS), the goal is to find a storage allocation (i.e, how much to store in each node) to maximize the probability of successful recovery. This problem turns out to be a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work we introduce an approximation framework based on large deviation inequalities and convex optimization. We propose two approximation algorithms and study the asymptotic performance of the resulting allocations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284025/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12963179","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Allocations for heterogenous distributed storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocations for heterogenous distributed storage","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2761ntranos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049406S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284026,"authors":[{"name":"Longbo Huang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Longbo","lastName":"Huang","id":"38245859600"},{"name":"Sameer Pawar","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Pawar","id":"37528652600"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406817800"},{"name":"Kannan Ramchandran","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kannan","lastName":"Ramchandran","id":"37270144500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284026","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Servers","Optimal scheduling","Throughput","Redundancy","Encoding","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","content-based retrieval","delays","information retrieval systems","linear codes","queueing theory","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queueing delay reduction","data centers","data retrieval latency reduction","linear code","request scheduling algorithm","blocking-one scheduling","BoS algorithm","data retrieval delay reduction","storage system design","content distribution networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we quantify how much codes can reduce the data retrieval latency in storage systems.

A major open problem in this area has been the design of codes that i) admit exact and low cost repair of nodes and ii) have arbitrarily high data rates. In this paper, we are interested in the metric of repair locality, which corresponds to the the number of disk accesses required during a node repair. Under this metric we characterize an information theoretic trade-off that binds together locality, code distance, and storage cost per node. We introduce Locally repairable codes (LRCs) which are shown to achieve this tradeoff. The achievability proof uses a \u201clocality aware\u201d flow graph gadget which leads to a randomized code construction. We then present the first explicit construction of LRCs that can achieve arbitrarily high data-rates.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284027","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284027.pdf","startPage":"2771","endPage":"2775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally repairable codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284027/","displayDocTitle":"Locally repairable codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963181","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284027/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally repairable codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2771papailiopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049907S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284028,"authors":[{"name":"N.

By this it is meant that each message symbol appears in a parity-check equation associated with small Hamming weight, thereby enabling recovery of the message symbol by examining a small number of other code symbols. This notion is expanded to the case when all code symbols, not just the message symbols, are covered by such \u201clocal\u201d parity. In this paper, we extend the results of Gopalan et. al. so as to permit recovery of an erased code symbol even in the presence of errors in local parity symbols. We present tight bounds on the minimum distance of such codes and exhibit codes that are optimal with respect to the local error-correction property. As a corollary, we obtain an upper bound on the minimum distance of a concatenated code.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284028","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284028.pdf","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal linear codes with a local-error-correction property","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal linear codes with a local-error-correction property","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284028/","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12963182","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284028/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal linear codes with a local-error-correction property","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2776prakash.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126619S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6284029,"authors":[{"name":"Negin Golrezaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Negin","lastName":"Golrezaei","id":"37704198700"},{"name":"Alexandros G.

Our main result is a closed form expression of the optimal collaboration distance as a function of the content reuse distribution parameters. We show that if the Zipf exponent of the content reuse distribution is greater than 1, it is possible to have a number of D2D interference-free collaboration pairs that scales linearly in the number of nodes. If the Zipf exponent is smaller than 1, we identify the best possible scaling in the number of D2D collaborating links.

In this paper, we show that the upper triangular matrix R encountered during the sphere decoding of a linear dispersion STBC can be rank-deficient even when the rate of the code is less than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. We then show that all known families of high rate (rate greater than 1) multigroup ML decodable codes have rank-deficient R matrix, even when the rate is less than the number of transmit and receive antennas, and this rank-deficiency problem arises only when the number of receive antennas is strictly less than the number of transmit antennas. Unlike the codes with full-rank R matrix, the average sphere decoding complexity of the STBCs whose R matrix is rank-deficient is polynomial in the constellation size, and hence is high.

For a fixed transmission rate, discrete input alphabets and no channel state information at the transmitter, optimal space-time codes (STCs) achieving both gains (full rate and full diversity) are well known. However, the complexity of maximum likelihood decoding increases exponentially with the number of space and time dimensions of the STC. Despite praiseworthy efforts to reduce the decoding complexity, optimal STCs are not used in practice in the case of more than two transmit antennas because of complexity reasons. It is generally accepted that reducing the dimension of the STC leads to a reduced diversity order. We show that this is not true for coded communication, assuming the presence of an outer error-correcting code with any coding rate. We propose a new class of full-rate full-diversity STCs; more specifically, time-varying space-only codes. This new class is referred to as EMI codes. Full diversity is proven in terms of outage probability, for the case where the number of receive antennas is larger than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, and is numerically verified in terms of outage and word error probability using LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284038","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2825","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284038.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-varying space-only codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Time-varying space-only codes","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284038/","accessionNumber":"12963192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284038/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-varying space-only codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2821duyck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082791S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284041,"authors":[{"name":"Idan Livni","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Idan","lastName":"Livni","id":"38469228700"},{"name":"Anatoly Khina","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Anatoly","lastName":"Khina","id":"37396405300"},{"name":"Ayal Hitron","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Ayal","lastName":"Hitron","id":"37888181500"},{"name":"Uri Erez","affiliation":["EE-Systems Department, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Uri","lastName":"Erez","id":"37284119700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284041","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Encoding","Covariance matrix","Joints","Benchmark testing","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","broadcast channels","MIMO communication","modulation coding","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time MIMO multicasting","Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel","closed loop scenario","capacity achieving multicast scheme","linear modulation","parallel scalar subchannels","AWGN codes"]}],"abstract":"Multicasting is the general method of conveying the same information to multiple users over a broadcast channel.

Specifically, it is proved that LDPC codes can approach the mutual information, with diminishing bit error probability, of any binary input memoryless channel with uniform input distribution when the average variable node degree is large. Moreover, simulation shows an interesting connection between jar decoding and BP decoding, i.e., BP decoding can be regarded as one of many ways to pick up a codeword from the jar for LDPC codes when it succeeds in outputting a codeword.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284047.pdf","startPage":"2861","endPage":"2865","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jar decoding: LDPC coding theorems for binary input memoryless channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Encoding","Error probability","Channel estimation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC coding theorem","binary input memoryless channel","jar decoding rule","channel input alphabet sequence","codeword","transmitted codeword estimation","low density parity check coding theorem","maximum a posteriori decoding","MAP decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","ML decoding","belief propagation decoding","BP decoding","mutual information","bit error probability","average variable node degree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation decoding","channel capacity","jar decoding","low-density parity-check codes","maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding","non-asymptotic coding theorems","non-asymptotic equipartition properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Jar decoding: LDPC coding theorems for binary input memoryless channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284047/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963201","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jar decoding: LDPC coding theorems for binary input memoryless channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2861yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064092S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284048,"authors":[{"name":"A.

More recently, the technique of decimation which involves fixing the values of certain bits during decoding, was proposed for FAIDs in order to make them more amenable to analysis while maintaining their good performance. In this paper, we show how decimation can be used adaptively to further enhance the guaranteed error correction capability of FAIDs that are already good on a given code. The new adaptive decimation scheme proposed has marginally added complexity but can significantly improve the slope of the error floor performance of a particular FAID. We describe the adaptive decimation scheme particularly for 7-level FAIDs which propagate only 3-bit messages and provide numerical results for column-weight three codes.

Initial results showed that decoders which employ a group of these algorithms operating in parallel can offer low error floor decoding for high-speed applications. As the number of two-bit bit flipping algorithms is large, designing such a decoder is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe a procedure to select collections of algorithms that work well together. This procedure relies on a recursive process which enumerates error configurations that are uncorrectable by a given algorithm. The error configurations uncorrectable by a given algorithm form its trapping set profile. Based on their trapping set profiles, algorithms are selected so that in parallel, they can correct a fixed number of errors with high probability.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284051","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284051.pdf","startPage":"2881","endPage":"2885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting two-bit bit flipping algorithms for collective error correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Selecting two-bit bit flipping algorithms for collective error correction","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284051/","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963205","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting two-bit bit flipping algorithms for collective error correction","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2881nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053034S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6284052,"authors":[{"name":"Yeow Meng Chee","affiliation":["School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yeow Meng","lastName":"Chee","id":"37286804400"},{"name":"Han Mao Kiah","affiliation":["School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Han Mao","lastName":"Kiah","id":"38469186400"},{"name":"Chengmin Wang","affiliation":["School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chengmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37676579700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284052","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Educational institutions","Measurement","Zinc","Hamming distance","Presses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum distance separable symbol-pair codes","symbol-pair read channels","Singleton-type bound","optimal symbol-pair codes","maximum distance separable","q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes","equidistant cyclic MDS symbol-pair codes","Mendelsohn designs"]}],"abstract":"We study (symbol-pair) codes for symbol-pair read channels introduced recently by Cassuto and Blaum (2010).

This new paradigm is motivated by the limitations of the reading process in high density data storage systems. They studied error correction in this new paradigm, specifically, the relationship between the minimum Hamming distance of an error correcting code and the minimum pair distance, which is the minimum Hamming distance between symbol-pair vectors derived from codewords of the code. It was proved that for a linear cyclic code with minimum Hamming distance d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</sub>\n, the corresponding minimum pair distance is at least d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</sub>\n + 3.

In addition, we consider the case where a read channel output is a prescribed number, b >; 2, of consecutive symbols and provide some generalizations of our results.

Through quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communicating it to others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate and act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we consider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version of biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one another via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e., the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that results in a final output in the form of light or fluorescence. Each stage in the process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective is to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer to the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node. The molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the node, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output of the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node. The molecules are trapped in the bacteria receptors forming complexes inside the bacteria which affect the genes responsible for producing the light. We focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the receptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the node. The optimal input distribution to maximize the mutual information between the output of the node, e.g., light, and the applied molecule concentration is derived. Further, the capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the collective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of molecular signaling concentration (which resembles M-ary modulation) is used. The achievable sensing capacity and the corresponding error probabilities were obtained for such practical signaling techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284080","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284080.pdf","startPage":"2959","endPage":"2963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collective sensing-capacity of bacteria populations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284080/","displayDocTitle":"Collective sensing-capacity of bacteria populations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963223","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284080/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collective sensing-capacity of bacteria populations","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2959einolghozati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051677S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6284109,"authors":[{"name":"Manabu Hagiwara","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA","National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Manabu","lastName":"Hagiwara","id":"37285899600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284109","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Decoding","Modulation","Encoding","Strontium","Equations","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","decoding","linear programming","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ML-certificate linear constraints","linear programming decoding","compact graphs","matrix polytope","permutation codes","rank modulations","linear programming methods","block structures","graph isomorphism problem","Kendall tau","Euclidean distances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rank Modulation","Permutation Codes","Linear Constraints","LP-Decoding","ML-Decoding","Compact Graph","Birkhoff Polytope"]}],"abstract":"Linear constraints for a matrix polytope with no fractional vertex are investigated as intersecting research among permutation codes, rank modulations, and linear programming methods.

This note documents our first efforts to obtain upper bounds on optimal code sizes (for said metric) ala Delsarte's approach. For the Hamming metric, Delsarte's seminal work on powerful linear programming (LP) bounds have been extended to permutation codes, via association scheme theory. For the Kendall-tau metric, the same extension needs the more general theory of coherent configurations, whereby the optimal code size problem can be formulated as an extremely huge semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Inspired by recent algebraic techniques for solving SDP's, we consider the dual problem, and propose an LP to search over a subset of dual feasible solutions. We obtain modest improvement over a recent Singleton bound due to Barg and Mazumdar. We regard this work as a starting point, towards fully exploiting the power of Delsarte's method, which are known to give some of the best bounds in the context of binary codes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284110","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284110.pdf","startPage":"2998","endPage":"3002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear programming upper bounds on permutation code sizes from coherent configurations related to the Kendall-tau distance metric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284110/","displayDocTitle":"Linear programming upper bounds on permutation code sizes from coherent configurations related to the Kendall-tau distance metric","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963231","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284110/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear programming upper bounds on permutation code sizes from coherent configurations related to the Kendall-tau distance metric","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p2998lim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082083S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6284116,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Hesham Mehana","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Hesham","lastName":"Mehana","id":"37546599900"},{"name":"Aria Nosratinia","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Aria","lastName":"Nosratinia","id":"37269740500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284116","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Vectors","Equalizers","Lattices","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO single-carrier frequency domain zero-forcing equalizer","SC-FDE","MIMO frequency selective channel","ZF receiver diversity","frequency-flat channel","lattice-reduction","ZF equalization","temporal diversity","spatial diversity","LR-aided equalization"]}],"abstract":"Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) has many advantages, but in the MIMO frequency selective channel its performance has not been fully characterized and several important open questions remain.

An important feature of the algorithm is that its speed can be controlled by tuning the users' learning rate; correspondingly, the algorithm converges within a few iterations even when the number of users and/or antennas per user in the system is large.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix exponential learning: Distributed optimization in MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284117","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284117.pdf","startPage":"3028","endPage":"3032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Matrix exponential learning: Distributed optimization in MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284117/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963238","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix exponential learning: Distributed optimization in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p3028mertikopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071629S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6284118,"authors":[{"name":"Siddhartan Govindasamy","affiliation":["Franklin W.\uc2a0Olin College of Engineering, Needham, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Siddhartan","lastName":"Govindasamy","id":"37392307500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284118","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284118","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Transmitters","Receivers","Approximation methods","Wireless networks","Signal to noise ratio","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","least mean squares methods","radio links","radio networks","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic data rate technique","receive-diversity systems","MMSE estimation","interferers","representative wireless link","spatially distributed network","receive diversity branches","linear minimum-mean-square-error receivers","Matern type I networks","Matern type II networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matern","MIMO","MMSE"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic data rates of receive-diversity systems with MMSE estimation and interferers at correlated locations","startPage":"3033","endPage":"3037","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284118","abstract":"An asymptotic technique is presented to characterize the bits/symbol achievable on a representative wireless link in a spatially distributed network with active interferers at correlated positions, N receive diversity branches, and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) receivers.

We provide a complete characterization of the minimum state reconstruction distortion at the decoder under a power constraint at the encoder, and show that a simple analog scheme with power control is optimal. More precisely, if the power available to the encoder is below certain threshold, the analog scheme using full power is optimal, however when the power available to the encoder is above that threshold, analog transmission using only a fixed amount of the available power is optimal. This is in contrast to the state amplification problem considered by Sutivong et al., when the channel states are known perfectly at the encoder for which the full power is always used in the optimal scheme. The converse proof of our result relies on a channel decomposition argument which was not necessary for the simpler case when the channel states are known perfectly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284126/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963247","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Amplification of the hidden Gaussian channel states","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplification of the hidden Gaussian channel states","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p3068tian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032936S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284127,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405852800"},{"name":"Keke Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keke","lastName":"Liu","id":"38367947700"},{"name":"Zulin Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zulin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404933700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284127","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Fourier transforms","Bit error rate","Null space","Hafnium","Upper bound","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","Hadamard matrices","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density arrays","circulant matrices","QC-LDPC codes","rank codes","row-redundancy codes","circulants array","null space","conjugacy classes properties","Hadamard products of matrices","random partitions","finite fields"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with general analysis on the rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants whose null space defines a QC-LDPC code.

In this paper, by using multi-weight circulants, a new BDD structure is proposed for the parity part of irregular QC LDPC codes to lower error floors and support efficient encoding. Since the parity part of parity-check matrices has flexible degree distribution with the aid of multi-weight circulants, QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure can have large minimum Hamming distance compared to those with the conventional BDD structure, especially, in the low-rate case. Simulation results show that QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure have lower error floor than those with the conventional BDD structure.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284131","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284131.pdf","startPage":"3093","endPage":"3097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new parity structure with multi-weight circulants for QC LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A new parity structure with multi-weight circulants for QC LDPC codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284131/","publicationDate":"July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12963252","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284131/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new parity structure with multi-weight circulants for QC LDPC codes","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p3093park.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062539S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6284141,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Karmakar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Karmakar","id":"37300825300"},{"name":"Mahesh K.

With the goal of investigating similar phenomena for continuous-time sources, this paper investigates the low-distortion performance of distributed coding of continuous-time, stationary, Gaussian sources based on high-rate sampling. It is found that for bandlimited sources and nonbandlimited sources whose spectra have sufficiently light, e.g., exponentially decreasing, tails, distributed source coding is asymptotically as good as centralized coding in the small distortion regime. On the other hand, for spectra with tails that decay as a power (greater than one) of frequency, it is found that for small distortions the distributed rate-distortion function is a constant times larger than the Shannon rate-distortion, where the constant decreases as the power increases. For example, it is approximately 1.2 when the power is 2. The conclusion is that for a stationary Gaussian source and asymptotically small distortion, the ratio of the distributed to centralized rate-distortion function is a function of the weight of the tail of the source spectrum. In the process of finding the ratio, the low distortion form of the centralized rate-distortion function is found for sources whose spectra have exponential and power law tails.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284208","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284208.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"362","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-distortion behavior at low distortion for densely sampled Gaussian data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Rate-distortion behavior at low distortion for densely sampled Gaussian data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284208/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963274","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284208/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-distortion behavior at low distortion for densely sampled Gaussian data","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p358neuhoff.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052803S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284211,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Molavian Jazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Enginerring, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA"],"firstName":"Ebrahim Molavian","lastName":"Jazi"},{"name":"J.

Since regular low-density generatormatrix codes are known to achieve the Shannon rate-distortion bound under optimal encoding as the degrees grow, our results suggest that spatial coupling can be used to reach the rate-distortion bound, under a low complexity belief-propagation guided-decimation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284212","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284212.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossy source coding via spatially coupled LDGM ensembles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284212/","displayDocTitle":"Lossy source coding via spatially coupled LDGM ensembles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963278","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284212/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossy source coding via spatially coupled LDGM ensembles","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p373aref.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060852S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6284219,"authors":[{"name":"Talha Ahmed Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, LUMS School of Science and Engineering, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Talha Ahmed","lastName":"Khan","id":"37089122626"},{"name":"Momin Uppal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, LUMS School of Science and Engineering, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Momin","lastName":"Uppal","id":"37424290100"},{"name":"Anders H\u00f8st-Madsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"H\u00f8st-Madsen","id":"37284887100"},{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zixiang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37278484800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284219","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Decoding","Relays","Upper bound","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","Monte Carlo methods","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rateless coded hybrid amplify-decode-forward cooperation","cooperative wireless multicast channel","transmitters","wireless links","distributed quasi-static Rayleigh fading","fixed-rate two-hop strategy","robust communications","fading conditions","decode-and-forward strategy","amplify-and-forward strategy","Monte-Carlo simulations","DF strategies","AF strategies","two-hop cooperation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284219","abstract":"We consider a cooperative wireless multicast channel with no channel state information available at the transmitters, and where all wireless links undergo independent identically distributed quasi-static Rayleigh fading.

For transmission over the binary erasure channel, it was recently shown that spatial coupling increases the belief propagation threshold of the ensemble to essentially the maximum a-priori threshold of the underlying component ensemble. This explains why convolutional LDPC ensembles, originally introduced by Felstr\u00f6m and Zigangirov, perform so well over this channel. We show that the equivalent result holds true for transmission over general binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. More precisely, given a desired error probability and a gap to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble which fulfills these constraints universally on this class of channels under belief propagation decoding. In fact, most codes in that ensemble have that property. The quantifier universal refers to the single ensemble/code which is good for all channels if we assume that the channel is known at the receiver. The key technical result is a proof that under belief propagation decoding spatially coupled ensembles achieve essentially the area threshold of the underlying uncoupled ensemble. We conclude by discussing some interesting open problems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284229","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284229.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially coupled ensembles universally achieve capacity under belief propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spatially coupled ensembles universally achieve capacity under belief propagation","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284229/","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963295","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284229/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially coupled ensembles universally achieve capacity under belief propagation","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p453kudekar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084505S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6284230,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Giurgiu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Giurgiu","id":"38469140900"},{"name":"Nicolas Macris","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Macris","id":"37563656600"},{"name":"R\u00fcdiger Urbanke","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"R\u00fcdiger","lastName":"Urbanke","id":"37283327000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284230","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"Investigations on spatially coupled codes have lead to the conjecture that, in the infinite size limit, the average input-output conditional entropy for spatially coupled low-density parity-check ensembles, over binary memoryless symmetric channels, equals the entropy of the underlying individual ensemble.

The resultant iterative decoding threshold values are very close to the Shannon limit.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284231","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","startPage":"463","endPage":"467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284231.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Joints","Convolutional codes","Detectors","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","iterative decoding","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["affine subspace outputs","2-ary input","joint iterative decoder","channel detector","LDPC decoder","nonbinary modulated signal inputs","2-QAM","binary spatially-coupled MacKay-Neal codes","EXIT-like function curve calculations","randomized window size","Shannon limit","low density parity check codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spatially-coupled binary MacKay-Neal codes for channels with non-binary inputs and affine subspace outputs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284231/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284231/","accessionNumber":"12963297","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-coupled binary MacKay-Neal codes for channels with non-binary inputs and affine subspace outputs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p463kasai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061443S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284232,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitri Truhachev","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Truhachev","id":"37284375300"},{"name":"David G.

Thanks to the bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cancellation process of CSA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), we propose an access protocol which is inspired by the convolutional LDPC code construction. The proposed protocol exploits the terminations of its graphical model to achieve the spatial coupling effect, attaining performance close to the theoretical limits of CSA. As for the convolutional LDPC code case, large iterative decoding thresholds are obtained by simply increasing the density of the graph. We show that the threshold saturation effect takes place by defining a suitable counterpart of the maximum-a-posteriori decoding threshold of spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles. In the asymptotic setting, the proposed scheme allows sustaining a traffic close to 1 [packets/slot].","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284235","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284235.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-coupled random access on graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatially-coupled random access on graphs","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963301","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284235/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-coupled random access on graphs","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p478liva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069604S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":6284236,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Mitzenmacher","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mitzenmacher","id":"37266774000"},{"name":"George Varghese","affiliation":["Yahoo Laboratories, UCSD CSE, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Varghese","id":"37271718000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284236","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Encoding","Tornadoes","Standards","Error analysis","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error correction codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Biff codes","bloom filter","fast error correction","large data sets","virtualized environments","multiple gigabytes transfers","data reconciliation","cloud reconciliation problems","error-correction schemes","decoding time","encoding time","space overhead","low-density parity-check codes","hash tables","set reconciliation algorithm","invertible Bloom lookup tables","decoding speed"]}],"abstract":"Large data sets are increasingly common in cloud and virtualized environments. For example, transfers of multiple gigabytes are commonplace, as are replicated blocks of such sizes. There is a need for fast error-correction or data reconciliation in such settings even when the expected number of errors is small. Motivated by such cloud reconciliation problems, we consider error-correction schemes designed for large data, after explaining why previous approaches appear unsuitable. We introduce Biff codes, which are based on Bloom filters and are designed for large data. For Biff codes with a message of length L and E errors, the encoding time is O(L), decoding time is O(L + E) and the space overhead is O(E). Biff codes are low-density parity-check codes; they are similar to Tornado codes, but are designed for errors instead of erasures. Further, Biff codes are designed to be very simple, removing any explicit graph structures and based entirely on hash tables. We derive Biff codes by a simple reduction from a set reconciliation algorithm for a recently developed data structure, invertible Bloom lookup tables. While the underlying theory is extremely simple, what makes this code especially attractive is the ease with which it can be implemented and the speed of decoding. We present results from a prototype implementation that decodes messages of 1 million words with thousands of errors in well under a second.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284236","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284236.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biff (Bloom filter) codes: Fast error correction for large data sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284236/","displayDocTitle":"Biff (Bloom filter) codes: Fast error correction for large data sets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963302","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284236/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biff (Bloom filter) codes: Fast error correction for large data sets","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p483mitzenmacher.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038966S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284238,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Nowak","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37396426300"},{"name":"Ruediger Kays","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Technical University Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Ruediger","lastName":"Kays","id":"37267615100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284238","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Reliability","Optimization","Iterative decoding","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved codes","modulation coding","parity check codes","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matching short LDPC codes","spectrally-efficient modulation","low-density parity-check codes","higher-order modulation","signal mapping design rules","constellation size","matching interleaver code","performance losses compensation","optimized mapping distributions","density evolution","extrinsic information transfer functions","structured codes"]}],"abstract":"The combination of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and higher-order modulation does usually neither require an interleaver in between nor elaborated signal mapping design rules.

Specifically, for every r, we present r-run strings with the minimum (respectively maximum) number of subsequences under any t deletions; and perform an exact analysis of the number of subsequences of these extremal strings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963306","htmlLink":"/document/6284240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A characterization of the number of subsequences obtained via the deletion channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A characterization of the number of subsequences obtained via the deletion channel","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p503liron.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062714S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6284242,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Cullina","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Coordinated Science Laboratory, Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cullina","id":"38469184700"},{"name":"Ankur A.

In this paper, we focus on the photon-counting measurement and study the photon and dimensional efficiencies attainable with modulations over classical- and nonclassical-state alphabets. We first review state-of-the-art coherent on-off-keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) with a photon-counting measurement, illustrating its asymptotic inefficiency relative to the Holevo limit. Then we analyze two architectures that improve upon the dimensional versus photon efficiency tradeoff achievable with conventional OOK or PPM. We show that at high photon efficiency these architectures achieve an efficiency tradeoff that differs from the best possible tradeoff by only a constant factor. The first architecture is a coherent-state transmitter that relies on feedback from the receiver to control the transmitted energy. The second architecture uses a single-photon number-state source.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ultimate limits of optical communication efficiency with photon-counting receivers","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284249","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284249.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"The ultimate limits of optical communication efficiency with photon-counting receivers","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284249/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963315","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ultimate limits of optical communication efficiency with photon-counting receivers","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p541dolinar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085509S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6284250,"authors":[{"name":"Saikat Guha","affiliation":["Disruptive Information Proc.

Achieving the Holevo capacity requires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible to implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along with classical postprocessing [1], [2]. Here, we apply our recent results on the classical-quantum polar code [3] - the first near-explicit, linear, symmetric-Holevo-rate achieving code - to the lossy optical channel, and we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan's original polar codes, applied to the DMC induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivable structured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or direct-detection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum fidelity as a channel parameter rather than the classical Bhattacharyya quantity to choose the \u201cgood channels\u201d in the polar-code construction), paired with a quantum successive-cancellation receiver - which involves a sequence of collective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantum state of the received codeword waveform - can attain the Holevo limit, and can hence in principle achieve higher rates than Arikan's polar code and decoder directly applied to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for construction of an optical realization of the quantum successive-cancellation receiver remains an open question.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284250","startPage":"546","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284250.pdf","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284250/","displayDocTitle":"Polar coding to achieve the Holevo capacity of a pure-loss optical channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284250/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12963316","publicationDate":"July 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar coding to achieve the Holevo capacity of a pure-loss optical channel","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p546guha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048281S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6284251,"authors":[{"name":"Mark M.

The achievability follows from the analysis of an interference neutralization scheme where the relays are partitioned into K pairs, and interference is neutralized separately by each pair of relays. For K = 1, we previously proved a gap of 4 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. In this paper, we give a result for general K.

The results on the existence of capacity achieving linear codes in the literature are limited to the random binary codes with equal probability generating matrix elements and sparse parity-check matrices. Moreover, the codes with sparse generating matrices reported in the literature are not proved to be capacity achieving for channels other than Binary Erasure Channel. As opposed to the existing results in the literature, which are based on optimal maximum a posteriori decoders, the proposed approach is based on a different decoder and consequently is suboptimal. We also demonstrate an interesting trade-off between the sparsity of the generating matrix and the error exponent (a constant which determines how exponentially fast the probability of error decays as block length tends to infinity). Based on our results, we also propose a channel coding rate achievable by linear codes at a given block length and error probability. Moreover, we prove the existence of capacity achieving linear codes with a given (arbitrarily low) density of ones on rows of the generating matrix. In addition to proving the existence of capacity achieving sparse codes, an important conclusion of our paper is to prove that any arbitrarily selected sequence of sparse generating matrices is capacity achieving with high probability.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284267","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284267.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity achieving linear codes with random binary sparse generating matrices over the Binary Symmetric Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284267/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity achieving linear codes with random binary sparse generating matrices over the Binary Symmetric Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963333","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284267/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity achieving linear codes with random binary sparse generating matrices over the Binary Symmetric Channel","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p621makhdoumikakhaki.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07555S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284272,"authors":[{"name":"Vance Chiang-Chi Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Vance Chiang-Chi","lastName":"Liao","id":"38469159600"},{"name":"Ming-Syan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Syan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280976600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2104-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2105-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6284272","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","DNA","Data mining","Runtime","Databases","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data mining","formal verification","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structural motif mining","biosequences","intrablock gap constraints","interblock gap constraints","biological sequences","sequential pattern mining","small alphabets","long sequences","DNA","protein sequences","substitutions","insertions","loops","deletions","depth-first spelling algorithm","sequence three-dimensional table","DIB-exuberance","candidate intrablocked gap sequential pattern spelling","candidate interblocked gap sequential pattern spelling","pattern verification","intrablock counting matrices","interblock counting matrices","intrablock size constraints","interblock size constraints","BASIC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequential patterns","Pattern mining","Data mining"]}],"abstract":"Among the biological sequences, sequential pattern mining reveals implicit motifs/patterns, which are of functional significance and have specific structures. Small alphabets and long sequences, such as DNA and protein sequences, are difficult to handle by traditional sequential pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the intra- and inter-blocked gap constraints can deal with the substitutions, insertions, loops, and deletions in evolution process. Hence we propose an approach called Depth-first spelling algorithm for mining structural motifs with Intra- and inter-Block gap constraints in biological sequences (referred to as DIB). DIB has two execution steps. First, it constructs a three-dimensional table of sequences by scanning the given dataset once. Second, DIB-Exuberance generates intra- and inter-blocked gap sequential patterns. Candidate intra- and inter-blocked gap sequential pattern spelling and pattern verification are carried out by DIB-Exuberance in a depth-first manner. Intra and inter gap constraints are handled by the intra- and inter-block counting matrices. The block size matrix deals with intra- and inter-block size constraints. In biological sequences, DIB's runtime is much shorter than BASIC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mining structural motifs for biosequences with intra- and inter-block gap constraints","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","doi":"10.1109/ISI.2012.6284272","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269208/6281845/06284272.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISI.2012.6284272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281845","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient mining structural motifs for biosequences with intra- and inter-block gap constraints","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284272/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12964310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mining structural motifs for biosequences with intra- and inter-block gap constraints","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086008S","chronDate":"11-14 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269208","isNumber":"6281845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269208","xplore-issue":"6281845","articleId":"6284272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284274,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Avram","affiliation":["Software Technology Laboratory, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Avram","id":"38469243300"},{"name":"Uwe Gl\u00e4sser","affiliation":["Software Technology Laboratory, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Gl\u00e4sser","id":"37284241900"},{"name":"Hamed Yaghoubi Shahir","affiliation":["Software Technology Laboratory, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamed Yaghoubi","lastName":"Shahir","id":"37681952500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2104-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2105-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6284274","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"abstract":"Maritime security is critical for many nations to address the vulnerability of their sea lanes, ports and harbours to a variety of threats and illegal activities.

All NIR images were captured night-time, outdoors and at mid-ranges (from 30 up to 120 meters). We utilized both commercial and academic face matchers and performed a set of experiments indicating that our cross-photometric score level fusion rule can be utilized to improve SWIR cross-spectral matching performance across all FR scenarios investigated. We also show that intra-spectral matching results, using either MWIR or NIR images, are comparable to the baseline results, i.e., when comparing visible to visible face images. Our experiments also indicate that the level of improvement in recognition performance is scenario dependent. Experiments also show that cross-spectral matching (the heterogeneous problem, where gallery and probe sets have face images acquired in different spectral bands) is a very challenging problem and it requires further investigation to address real-world law enforcement or military situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security

technique using decoder side information, which is unknown at the encoder, to help the reconstruction. In this paper, we propose and implement a new WZC structure, called residual WZC, for the quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv problem where side information can be arbitrarily distributed. In our two-stage residual WZC, the source is quantized twice and the input of the second stage is the quantization error (residue) of the first stage. The codebook of the first stage quantizer must be simultaneously good for source and channel coding, since it also acts as a channel code at the decoder. Stemming from the non-ideal quantization at the encoder, a problem of channel decoding beyond capacity is identified and solved when we design the practical decoder. Moreover, by using the modified reinforced belief-propagation quantization algorithm, the low-density parity check code (LDPC), whose edge degree is optimized for channel coding, also performs well as a source code. We then implement the residual WZC by an LDPC and a low-density generator matrix code (LDGM). The simulation results show that our practical construction approaches the Wyner-Ziv bound. Compared with previous works, our construction can offer more design flexibility in terms of distribution of side information and practical code rate selection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284308/","accessionNumber":"12963350","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based code design for quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv problem with arbitrary side information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based code design for quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv problem with arbitrary side information","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p6wei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073941S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284322,"authors":[{"name":"Shubin Zheng","affiliation":["College of Urban Railway Transportation, Shanghai University Engineering of Science, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shubin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38469226600"},{"name":"Xiaodong Chai","affiliation":["College of Urban Railway Transportation, Shanghai University Engineering of Science, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Chai","id":"38469156700"},{"name":"Xiaoxue An","affiliation":["College of Urban Railway Transportation, Shanghai University Engineering of Science, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"An","id":"38469302400"},{"name":"Liming Li","affiliation":["College of Urban Railway Transportation, Shanghai University Engineering of Science, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Li","id":"38469187000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6284322","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":637},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Cameras","Rails","Calibration","Rail transportation","Image processing","Charge coupled devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic optical inspection","calibration","CCD image sensors","computer vision","gauges","image thinning","iterative methods","railway accidents","railway engineering","railway safety","remaining life assessment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["railway track gauge inspection method","computer vision","railway track gauge irregularity","rail service life","vehicle service life","vehicle falling off rail","wheel trapping","driving accidents","dynamic inspection method","CCD cameras","charge-coupled device cameras","red laser sector lights","inspection principle","calibration method","inspection system","gauge points","image processing technology","image component extraction","differential iteration threshold","adaptive iteration threshold","image dilation","image thinning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["track gauge inspection","calibration","image processing"]}],"abstract":"Railway track gauge irregularity severely reduces the service life of rail and vehicle, and even result in vehicle falling off rail or wheel trapping, which causes driving accidents.

position need to be controlled within a pointed limits, which lead to two problem to be solved: one is how to describe state uncertainties at every different sample times; the other is how to deduce the next state uncertainty according to the current one. This paper provides a method to construct a stochastic predictive model to covering those problems. In the concrete, the predictive model uses Gaussian and Beta distribution as well as Monte Carlo Method to describe and deduce the state uncertainties respectively. The method is also applied to the process of pushing a nano-particle using AFM.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284330","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06284330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","startPage":"1335","endPage":"1340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic state prediction in AFM based nanomanipulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic state prediction in AFM based nanomanipulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284330/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12962559","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284330/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic state prediction in AFM based nanomanipulation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076101S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6284330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6284343,"authors":[{"name":"Liguo Zhang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liguo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469181300"},{"name":"Jianbin Jiao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianbin","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37546470800"},{"name":"Qixiang Ye","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qixiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37416976100"},{"name":"Zhenjun Han","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenjun","lastName":"Han","id":"37897747400"},{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"38469267400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6284343","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Image edge detection","Hidden Markov models","Surface emitting lasers","Transforms","Laser modes","Laser noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","inspection","object detection","production engineering computing","welding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust weld line detection","cross structured light","hidden Markov model","CSL","HMM","weldment surface","laser stripes","classical Hough transform based method","automatic weld inspection systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Weld line detection","Cross structured light","HMM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a vision-based weld line detection system with cross structured light (CSL) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

The Hidden Markov Model filters out various noises on the weldment surface and then detects laser stripes precisely, which guarantees the accuracy of weld line location.

However, these head-mounted devices are bulky and can only assist a user to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we detail a wearable stereovision system that can not only help avoid obstacles, but also stream real-time video feed via the 3G network. This wearable device is composed of an eyeglasses and a power-efficient embedded processing device. On one end, the eyeglasses carries two miniature cameras for the stereo-imaging. On the other end, we utilize a FPGA and FIFO buffers to synchronize and combine the stereo-images. Moreover, through a series of parallel programming techniques, we achieve a real-time stereo-matching on the embedded processor. In addition, the video captured by this system can be streamed to a mobile device over the 3G network. A prominent application of this device is that, the healthy sighted individual can make use of the live video feed to provide logistical guidance to a visually impaired user.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284345","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06284345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wearable stereo vision system for visually impaired","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A wearable stereo vision system for visually impaired","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284345/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12962574","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6284345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wearable stereo vision system for visually impaired","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065363S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6284345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284372,"authors":[{"name":"Fu Dong Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics & Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Cheng Du, Si Chuan, China"],"firstName":"Fu Dong","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Li Mei Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics & Aeronautics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Cheng Du, Si Chuan, China"],"firstName":"Li Mei","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Astronautics, Aeronautics University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Cheng Du, Si Chuan, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600518600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6284372","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284372","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Acoustic beams","Transducers","Pistons","Absorption","Mathematical model","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadband networks","delays","transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam-forming design","broadband beam-steerable parametric array","broadband parametric array beam-forming","loop transducer array conditions","rectangle transducer array conditions","frequency beam","main-lobe peak value","main-lobe directivity","side-lobe amplitude","element signal time-delay method","parametric array beam-steering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rectangle array","Loop array","Beam forming","Beam steering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284372","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06284372.pdf","startPage":"1580","endPage":"1585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6284372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of beam-forming for broadband beam-steerable parametric array","abstract":"This paper has discussed the simulation and analysis to beam-forming of broadband parametric array in both rectangle and loop transducer array conditions.

By having a compact structure, low driving voltage and a simple control system, microrobots could complete a variety of underwater tasks, even in limited spaces. To realize the multifunctionality of the microrobot for adapting to complex underwater environments, we proposed a walking biomimetic microrobot with two kinds of motion attitudes, lying state and standing state. The microrobot used eleven ICPF (ionic conducting polymer film) actuators to move and two SMA (shape memory alloy) actuators to change motion attitude. In the lying state, the microrobot could implement stick insect-inspired walking/rotating motion, fish-like swimming motion, horizontal grasping motion, and floating motion. In the standing state, it could implement inchworm-inspired crawling motion along two directions and vertical grasping motion. Then we developed a prototype of multi-functional biomimetic microrobot and evaluated its walking, rotating and floating speeds experimentally.

Energy per bit is employed as the performance metric. Minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions are determined to quantify the energy efficiency in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In particular, the impact of channel and source variations is investigated. A block-fading model in which fading coefficients are arbitrarily correlated in one block before assuming independent realizations in the next one, is considered. Initially, the effect of fading correlation on energy efficiency is analyzed. It is shown that while minimum energy per bit does not depend on the fading correlation, wideband slope decreases as positive correlation increases, resulting in increased energy requirements at low but nonzero SNR levels. Subsequently, an ON-OFF source arrival model is considered. It is shown that while the minimum energy per bit does not get affected by source variations, wideband slope diminishes with increasing source burstiness.

Previously invented relay coding strategies have not been designed to achieve this enormous capacity occurring in the low SNR region. In this paper, we propose a simple coding strategy for a relay channel with low SNRs or, equivalently, for a very noisy relay channel. The multiplicative repetition is utilized to design this simple coding strategy. We claim that the proposed strategy is simple since the destination and the relay can decode with almost the same computational complexity by sharing the same structure of decoder. An appropriate static power allocation which yields the maximum throughput close to the optimal one in low SNRs is suggested. Under practical constraints such as equal time-sharing etc., the asymptotic performance of this simple strategy is within 0.5 dB from the achievable rate of relay channel. Furthermore, the performance at short code lengths enjoys a relaying gain by approximately 1.4 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284699/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284699/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963402","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Code design for very noisy relay channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code design for very noisy relay channels","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p930suthisopapan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079568S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6284702,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Ivashkina","affiliation":["ETIS-UMR8051, ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise-CNRS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Ivashkina","id":"37888185200"},{"name":"Iryna Andriyanova","affiliation":["ETIS-UMR8051, ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise-CNRS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Iryna","lastName":"Andriyanova","id":"37546590700"},{"name":"Pablo Piantanida","affiliation":["Department of Telecoms, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Piantanida","id":"37293979700"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["Department of Telecoms, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284702","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284702","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Encoding","Relays","Decoding","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","block codes","graph theory","iterative methods","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erasure-correcting codes","erasure-detecting codes","full-duplex binary erasure relay channel","asymptotic iterative performance","sparse-graph codes","block-Markov codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the asymptotic iterative performance of block-Markov, sparse-graph codes over the binary erasure relay channel is investigated.

Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A save-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time \u03c1 (dubbed the save ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting, with the remaining fraction 1 - \u03c1 used for data transmission. The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the ESD efficiency, \u03b7. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD being a battery with \u03b7 <; 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with \u03b7 = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is derived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed study.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284704","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284704.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal save-then-transmit protocol for energy harvesting wireless transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284704/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal save-then-transmit protocol for energy harvesting wireless transmitters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284704/","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal save-then-transmit protocol for energy harvesting wireless transmitters","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p955luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103336S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284706,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Gurakan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Berk","lastName":"Gurakan","id":"38469129200"},{"name":"Omur Ozel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Omur","lastName":"Ozel","id":"37400338000"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406100800"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2067},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Energy exchange","Wireless communication","Throughput","Energy harvesting","Data communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","energy harvesting","energy management systems","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy cooperation","energy harvesting wireless communications","multihop communication scenario","source node","relay node","destination node","transmitter","energy transfer unit","energy arrivals","optimal offline energy management policies","end-to-end throughput","convex problem","relay energy profile"]}],"abstract":"We consider a simple multi-hop communication scenario composed of a source node, a relay node and a destination node where the source and the relay can harvest energy from the nature. Energy required for communication arrives (is harvested) at the transmitter and an unlimited battery stores it before being consumed for transmission. In addition, the source can assist the relay by transferring a portion of its energy to the relay through a separate energy transfer unit. We address this energy cooperation between the source and the relay in a deterministic setting. Assuming that the source and the relay nodes are informed of the energy arrivals in advance, we find jointly optimal offline energy management policies for the source and the relay that maximize the end-to-end throughput. We show that this problem is a convex problem. In order to gain insight about the structure of the solution, we consider specific scenarios. In particular, we show that if the relay energy profile is higher at the beginning and lower at the end with only one intersection, then matching the power sequences of the source and the relay slot-by-slot is optimal. We also consider the case when the energy of the source is available at the beginning and show that transferring energy in the first slot is optimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy cooperation in energy harvesting wireless communications","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284706","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268627/6281806/06284706.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2012.6284706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6284706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6284706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Energy cooperation in energy harvesting wireless communications","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6284706/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12963409","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy cooperation in energy harvesting wireless communications","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"p965gurakan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074018S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268627","isNumber":"6281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268627","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6281806","articleId":"6284706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6284712,"authors":[{"name":"Eyal En Gad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eyal En","lastName":"Gad","id":"37593222400"},{"name":"Anxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anxiao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37315964400"},{"name":"Jehoshua Bruck","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jehoshua","lastName":"Bruck","id":"37271794000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2579-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2580-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2578-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-8095"}],"articleNumber":"6284712","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Microprocessors","Transistors","Memory management","Modulation","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","write-once storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell flash memory design","enterprise storage systems","write asymmetric memory codes","WAM codes","reliability improvement","endurance improvement","block erasures","multiset permutations","charge levels","memory capacity","floating gate transistors","relative cell levels","information representation","instantaneous rate","total capacity rate"]}],"abstract":"The limited endurance of flash memories is a major design concern for enterprise storage systems.

Overall, our new method enables faster writes, improved reliability as well as improved endurance by allowing multiple writes between block erasures. We study the capacity of the new WAM codes with relative levels, where the information is represented by multiset permutations induced by the charge levels, and show that it achieves the capacity of any other WAM codes with the same number of writes. Specifically, we prove that it has the potential to double the total capacity of the memory.

A mini even free vision feedback system is on demand when rehabilitation trainings need to be implemented at home. In this study a vision feedback system is developed based on open source software. The original 3D character is generated by a piece of special software Makehuman and exported as several optional formats such as obj, mtl, bvh and so on. These exported files are re-loaded in a graph interface built with wxWidgets and rendered with OpenGL. The motion sensors are fixed on the patient's limbs and the motion data are sampled to update 3D model rendering. The patients' motion posture is shown on a screen in real time to prompt their rehabilitation training. The new vision feedback system presented in this paper does not depend on any commercial software or expensive hardware. As a fully open source system, it is very appropriate to realize more economical rehabilitation trainings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Skeleton","Bonding","Machine

The chattering is also reduced by using a saturation function. But this control strategy only guarantees an asymptotic convergence. In order to increase the tracking speed for robotic joints when tracking error is small, a sliding surface with saturation function of the error is proposed in this paper. By applying this sliding surface, a fast finite time convergence is achieved. 6R industrial robots have highly coupled inertia coefficients in the inertia matrix. When modeling error exists, system precision and stability would be affected greatly. To improve the system robustness property, separate sliding surface feedback compensation torques mainly for the last three joints are applied in this paper. The compensation torques also help increase the tracking speed. The proposed controller is tested through ADAMS-MATLAB co-simulations on a 6R serial industrial robot prototype to prove its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285104","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06285104.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QSMC based on reaching law using saturation sliding surface for 6R industrial robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285104/","displayDocTitle":"QSMC based on reaching law using saturation sliding surface for 6R industrial robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12962647","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6285104/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QSMC based on reaching law using saturation sliding surface for 6R industrial robots","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046005S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6285104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6285136,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaopeng Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Robots and Systems, Ministry of Education, China","Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaopeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37674514800"},{"name":"Min Pan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Robots and Systems, Ministry of Education, China","Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Pan","id":"38469132600"},{"name":"Zhan Tao Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Aerospace Institute for Metrology and Measurement Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhan Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"38469132100"},{"name":"Fei Meng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Robots and Systems, Ministry of Education, China","Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Meng","id":"38196787600"},{"name":"Han Bao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Robots and Systems, Ministry of Education, China","Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Bao","id":"38469237400"},{"name":"Wencheng Ni","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Robots and Systems, Ministry of Education, China","Intelligent Robotics Institute, School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wencheng","lastName":"Ni","id":"38469188300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6285136","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"abstract":"In this paper, an active embedded stereo vision system with IR filters is proposed for robust three-dimensional localization.

To suppress the tremor, the medical drugs or auxiliary exoskeleton system were applied. The amplitude and frequency of tremor movement were crucial to effective suppression by exoskeleton system. In this study, base on the drawback of the kinematic information and the relationship between surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals and muscle activations, the prediction of angle from sEMG signals by using network was proposed and realized, avoiding establishing a complex mathematical model to describe the angular displacement. Comparing the sEMG captured from tremor with the normal signals, the linear profile-curve of sEMG was extracted as a feature value, and the relationship model between joint angle and sEMG was constructed by the radial basis function neural network (RBF). The analysis of the experimental data showed that the linear profile-curve could be used to predict the angle or angular velocity, with higher accuracy and adaptability comparing with root mean square (RMS) of EMG.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285668/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12962690","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6285668/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of sEMG-based tremor joint angle using the RBF neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of sEMG-based tremor joint angle using the RBF neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080983S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6285668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6285687,"authors":[{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Shilian Mao","affiliation":["Graduate school of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Mao","id":"38059839200"},{"name":"Liwei Shi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37531265800"},{"name":"Maoxun Li","affiliation":["Graduate school of Engineering, Kagawa University, Hayashi, Kagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Maoxun","lastName":"Li","id":"38468707800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6285687","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285687","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Servomotors","Force","Drag","Robot kinematics","Propellers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrodynamics","marine systems","microrobots","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","robot kinematics","servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinematic analysis","amphibious spherical robot","microrobots","locomotion velocity","enduring time","compact sizes","mother-son multirobots cooperation system","GSL system","GSLMom robot","fixed hemisphere hull","openable quarter ball hulls","unit locomotion system","water jet propeller","two servo motors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spherical robot","Amphibious robot","Water-jet propeller","Quadruped walking","Mother robot","Walking gait"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, microrobots are being widely researched in order to deal with complicated missions in limited spaces. But important abilities such as locomotion velocity and enduring time are usually sacrificed in order to realize compact sizes. To solve these problems, we proposed a mother-son multi-robots cooperation system, named GSL system, which included several microrobots as son robots, and a novel designed amphibious spherical robot as the mother robot. The mother robot, which was called GSLMom robot, was designed to be able to carry microrobots and provide power supply for them. This paper will mainly focus on the structure and mechanism of the GSLMom robot. The GSLMom robot, which was designed as an amphibious spherical one, was shaped by a fixed hemisphere hull, and two openable quarter ball hulls. The robot was equipped with a 4 unit locomotion system, and each unit consists of a water jet propeller and two servo motors. Each servo motor could rotate 90\u00b0 in horizontal or vertical direction respectively. When moving in water, servo motors controlled the directions of water jet propellers and the 4 propellers worked to actuate the robot. With this mechanism, the robot could realize moving forward, backward, rotating, floating and sinking motion in water. In the ground situation, propellers were used as legs, and servo motors actuated these legs to realize walking mechanism, so that the robot could realize moving forward, backward, and rotating motions on the ground. After discussed structures, actuating strategies were proposed for the robot. And kinematic models of the robot were also built.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285687","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06285687.pdf","startPage":"2214","endPage":"2219","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and kinematic analysis of an amphibious spherical robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Design and kinematic analysis of an amphibious spherical robot","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6285687/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12962709","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and kinematic analysis of an amphibious spherical robot","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065843S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6285687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6285702,"authors":[{"name":"Kyongwon Han","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Kyongwon","lastName":"Han","id":"38469160000"},{"name":"Yantao Tian","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yantao","lastName":"Tian","id":"37272870100"},{"name":"Yongsu Kong","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yongsu","lastName":"Kong","id":"38469248400"},{"name":"Jinsong Li","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Li","id":"37857997700"},{"name":"Yinghui Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469301500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6285702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Neural networks","Training","Trajectory","Neurons","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent control","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","plates (structures)","three-term control","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking control","ball system","plate system","improved PSO online training PID neural network","on-line training PIDNN controller","trajectory tracking","under-actuated system","mathematical model","nonlinear control","intelligent control","improved particle swarm optimization method","differential evolution algorithm","DEPSO","multilayered forward neural network","PIDNN control method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball and plate system","particle swarm optimization","differential evolution","nonlinear system","PID controller","neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285702","abstract":"In this paper, an on-line training PIDNN controller using an improved DEPSO algorithm for trajectory tracking of the ball and plate system is proposed. Since the ball and plate system is a typical under-actuated system with inherent nonlinearity and coupling between its parameters, the accurate mathematical model is difficult to be derived, so that a lot of nonlinear control and intelligent control methods are used for the ball and plate system control. The control method using a PID neural network is one of the intelligent methods. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization method based on differential evolution algorithm (DEPSO) is used to train the weighting factors of multilayered forward neural network. This PIDNN control method based on DEPSO algorithm can overcome the shortcoming of the BP algorithm which is easy to get into local minimum. At the same time, the simulation results of tracking control for ball and plate system show that the proposed PIDNN controller has simple structure, nice static and dynamic characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285702","startPage":"2297","endPage":"2302","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2012.6285702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282333","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6264153/6282333/06285702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking control of ball and plate system using a improved PSO on-line training PID neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tracking control of ball and plate system using a improved PSO on-line training PID neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6285702/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12962724","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking control of ball and plate system using a improved PSO on-line training PID neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2012396.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069273S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6264153","isNumber":"6282333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6264153","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6282333","articleId":"6285702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6285704,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjuan Yang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chengjuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38469237300"},{"name":"Wenjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38469170800"},{"name":"Xuesong Mei","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Mei","id":"37544593200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1278-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1277-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"6285704","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser ablation","Ultrafast electronics","Materials","X-ray lasers","Power lasers","Heating","Semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium alloys","bubbles","casting","high-speed optical techniques","impurities","laser ablation","microcracks","titanium alloys","vanadium alloys","X-ray chemical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal effects","femtosecond laser ablation","millisecond laser ablation","high-average power","high-peak energy","elemental composition","ablated material","Oxford INCA energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy","EDS","electronic digital imaging system","recast layer","microcracks","bubbles","impurity","oxygen content","ultrashort pulse duration","heat affected zone","TiAlV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtosecond laser ablation","elemental composition","recast layer","heat-affected zone"]}],"abstract":"In order to have a deeper understanding of femtosecond (fs) laser ablation mechanism and its thermal effects on material, comparative experiments of a millisecond laser with high average power and a femtosecond laser with high peak energy were carried out on Ti-6Al-4V.

Curiosity, currently en route, relies on radio isotope decay as its source of electrical power. Given the limited amount of space available for solar panels and that the wattage available from radioisotope decay is limited; power is clearly a critical resource for any rover. The goal of this work is to estimate the energy cost of traversing terrains of various properties. Knowledge of energy costs for terrain traversal will allow for more efficient path planning enabling rovers to have longer periods of activity. Our system accepts grid-based terrain elevation data in the form of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) along with rover and soil parameters, and uses a newly developed model of the most common rover suspension design (rocker-bogie) along with a terramechanics-based wheel-soil interaction model to build a map of the estimated torque required by each wheel to move the rover to each adjacent terrain square.

First, we model the overall studied system as a weighted graph, and then we formulate the spectrum sharing as a vertex coloring problem. Second, we show that the two problems are similar and we design a greedy algorithm to solve both problems using two selection criteria.

importance of using a modulation scheme which is both power and bandwidth efficient. Continuous phase modulation (CPM) provides an attractive option for spectral efficient communication systems. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes combined with CPM has a potential to result in a spectrally efficient scheme that is also energy efficient in that it yields low error rates at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, LDPC coded CPM which can be decoded and demodulated iteratively is considered for uplink of satellite communications. In order to reduce the positive feedback during iterative detection with short frame, an improved method based on weighed extrinsic information exchange is presented. Theoretic analysis and simulation results over Rayleigh fading channel show that the proposed method can not only achieve lower bit error rate (BER) and better convergence compared to the previous methods, but also offer very low error-floor and good BER performance in waterfall region.

Timing delay and phase offset are assumed as perfectly known. The second derivative of the neperian logarithm of the probability density function (PDF) p(x|\u03b3) of the observation vector x parametrized by the carrier frequency offset, is theoretically built up. Then numerical Monte Carlo (MC) method is used to find out the true CRLB and the modified CRB (MCRB) from linearly modulated signals over FRFC with complex additive white Gaussian noise (CAWGN). Through the assessment of the CRLB and the MCRB for various observation window size our method is proven to be trustworthy. The reliability of the method is made obvious from both square quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals. The simulation result has shown that optimal NDA carrier frequency recovery depends on the constellation density for low SNR range. For both QAM and PSK modulations and for different modulation orders, it is shown that the CRLB is as low as the observation window length is larger. We also show that CRLB to MCRB ratio tends asymptotically towards 1 for larger SNR range as far as the modulation density increases. The derived bound provides an efficient standard to compare the performance of any unbiased NDA carrier frequency estimator for linearly modulated signals over FRFC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012

Heterogeneous mobile network architecture. In this paper, we consider a two tier Heterogeneous network with multiple radio access technologies (RATS) namely; (i) the secondary network which comprises of cognitive enabled femto base stations which are referred to as cognitive-femto BS (CFBS) such that each of the BS are equipped with a single antenna and (ii) the macrocell network which is considered as a primary network. The effectiveness of the cognitive transmission is based on the efficient spectrum sensing algorithms which determine the availability of the spectrum holes. However, it is equally important for the cognitive network to minimize the cross-tier interference particularly during (i) the spectrum sensing and (ii) the cognitive transmission if spectrum is available. By exploiting the cooperation among the CFBS, the multiple CFBS can be considered as a single base station with multiple geographically dispersed antennas. In this context, we proposed a smart network where CFBS collaborates to reduce the cross-tier interference level by directing the main beam toward the desired femtocell mobile user and creating null toward the cross-tier interference. The resultant network is referred to as Smart cognitive-femto network (SCFN) which requires the CFBS to be self-aware such that the CFBS are aware of their surroundings and adapt accordingly to maintain a reliable and efficient communication link. In order to determine the effectiveness of the proposed smart network, we study the interference rejection (or suppression) capabilities of the SCFN. It has been shown that the proposed smart network offers significant performance improvements in interference suppression and signal to interference ratio (SIR) and may be considered as a promising solution to the interference management problems in Heterogeneous network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285835","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269207/6285764/06285835.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6285764","startPage":"402","endPage":"407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the interference suppression capabilities of cognitive enabled femto cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the interference suppression capabilities of cognitive enabled femto cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285835/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12964265","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6285835/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the interference suppression capabilities of cognitive enabled femto cellular networks","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p402shakir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067496S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269207","isNumber":"6285764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269207","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6285764","articleId":"6285835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6285836,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Ting Sun","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Ting Sun","id":"38006692600"},{"name":"Jia-Chin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jia-Chin Lin","id":"37536880000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1950-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1949-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1948-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6285836","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Multiple signal classification","Bandwidth","Receivers","Vehicles","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","access protocols","demodulation","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","frequency estimation","mean square error methods","multipath channels","multiplexing","OFDM modulation","signal classification","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-carrier frequency-offset estimation","carrier-aggregation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communications","fourth-generation mobile communications","4G mobile communications","carrier frequency offsets","CFO","CA-OFDM communications","multiple signal classification","MUSIC","mean square error","MSE","time-varying multipath fading channels","medium access control","MAC layer","physical-layer multiplexing","PHY multiplexing","fast Fourier transform","FFT demodulation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication is a promising technique for use in fourth-generation (4G) mobile communications. Meanwhile, the carrier aggregation technique becomes crucial for raising the transmission rate. The achievable data rate of an OFDM system is generally limited by spectral efficiency and the available bandwidth; the former strongly depends on the adopted modulation techniques, and the latter strongly depends on the spectrum policy. A carrier aggregation method is a feasible and flexible bandwidth utilization technique that facilitates upgrades to transmission throughput by aggregating several contiguous or non-contiguous carriers. Unlike conventional OFDM systems, multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) must be taken into consideration for carrier-aggregated OFDM (CA-OFDM) communications. Several preambles are constructed as pilots for individual component carriers. With knowledge of the preamble property, novel estimation methods for multiple CFOs are proposed and investigated by taking advantage of either a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) or a root-MUSIC algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve good performance in terms of the error rate of detection and the mean-square error (MSE) over time-varying multipath fading channels. With assistance from the accurate multi-CFO estimation and compensation proposed in this paper, the carrier aggregation, which is conventionally accomplished on the medium access control (MAC) layer with a few parallel, ordinary OFDM inner receivers, can be effectively transformed to be a physical-layer (PHY) multiplexing technique by means of a larger-size fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulation. This transformation can reduce the implementation overhead needed by independently building several parallel ordinary inner receivers. This transformation can also save the header length prefixed on the MAC layer for conducting carrier aggregations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-carrier frequency-offset estimation based on MUSIC for carrier-aggregation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communications","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285836","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269207/6285764/06285836.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6285764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-carrier frequency-offset estimation based on MUSIC for carrier-aggregation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communications","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6285836/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12964266","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-carrier frequency-offset estimation based on MUSIC for carrier-aggregation orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communications","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p408sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039319S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269207","isNumber":"6285764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269207","xplore-issue":"6285764","articleId":"6285836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6285837,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Kui Chang","affiliation":["Department of communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Han-Kui Chang","id":"38026075700"},{"name":"Jia-Chin Lin","affiliation":["Department of communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jia-Chin Lin","id":"37536880000"},{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of communications Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Meng-Lin Ku","id":"37602473400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1950-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1949-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1948-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6285837","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Information technology","Wireless communication","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","higher order statistics","probability","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential spectrum sensing","higher-order statistics","sensing capability","miss occurrence probability","secondary user","spectrum resource recycling","false alarm occurrence probability","spectral utilization","cognitive radio receiver","signal-to-noise ratio","fading channel","sequential test detector","spectral sensing","cumulant statistics","spectrum sensing reliability","Gaussian noise","binary hypothesis testing","sequential probability ratio test","vacant spectrum detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential spectrum sensing based on higher-order statistics for cognitive radios","doi":"10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6285764","endPage":"417","publicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269207/6285764/06285837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCITechnol.2012.6285837","startPage":"413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6285837","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is a crucial technique used to discover available bands that are not occupied by primary users in cognitive networks (CNs). With good sensing capability in terms of low probability of a miss occurrence, secondary users can effectively recycle the spectrum resource without disturbing active primary users. With low probability of a false alarm occurrence, spectral utilization may be relatively simple spectrum sensing technique. In practice, a cognitive radio (CR) receiver has to operate at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes because of channel fades and noise. Therefore, low SNR inevitably degrades the performance of ED dramatically. In this paper, a sequential test detector based on higher-order statistics (HOS) is investigated to conduct effective spectral sensing, especially in low-SNR environments. By taking advantage of cumulant statistics, spectrum sensing reliability can be significantly improved as Gaussian noise can be overwhelmed. Based on binary hypothesis testing, a low-complexity sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is thus developed for effectively detecting the vacant spectrum to meet the requirements of the sensing duty cycle. Simulation results show that the proposed detector outperforms conventional ED, especially in low SNR environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6285837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12964267","htmlLink":"/document/6285837/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sequential spectrum sensing based on higher-order statistics for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential spectrum sensing based on higher-order statistics for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"p413chang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043993S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269207","isNumber":"6285764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269207","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6285764","articleId":"6285837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6285839,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Almradi","affiliation":["Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Almradi","id":"38469150500"},{"name":"Sohail Dianat","affiliation":["Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Sohail","lastName":"Dianat","id":"37327108500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1950-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1949-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1948-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6285839","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Binary phase shift keying","Estimation","Receiving antennas","Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","AWGN","integration","phase shift keying","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cramer-Rao lower bound","nondata aided SNR estimation","BPSK modulated signal","MISO","STBC channel","nondata aided signal to noise ratio estimation","binary phase shift keying modulated signal","multiple input single output","space time block codes channel","Alamouti transmit diversity model","additive white Gaussian noise","numerical integration","Fisher information matrix element","antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB)","data aided (DA)","non-data aided (NDA) estimation","transmit diversity","binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signals","space time block codes (STBC) channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB) for the estimation of Non Data Aided (NDA) Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) estimation of Binary Phase Shift keying (BPSK) modulated signals over Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) with Space Time Block Codes (STBC) channels is derived.

The lower bounds were derived for non-data aided estimation when the transmitted symbols are unknown to the receiver. The NDA bound is then compared to the Data Aided (DA) estimation where the transmitted symbols are known to the receiver. Numerical integration is being used to find the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) elements in order to calculate the CRLB in the NDA case. It is shown that there is a significant improvement when compared to the Single Input Single Output (SISO) CRLB.

The EM algorithm is a method that finds the Maximum Likelihood (ML) solution iteratively when there are unobserved (hidden or missing) data. Extension of the proposed approach to other types of modulated signals in estimating SNR is straight forward. The performance of the estimator is assessed using the NDA Cramer Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs). Alamouti coding technique is used in this paper with two transmit antennas and one receive antenna. Our assumption is that the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with unknown variance, and scaled by fixed unknown complex channel gain. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that the proposed estimator offers a substantial improvement over the conventional Single Input Single Output (SISO) NDA SNR estimator due to the use of the statistical dependences in space and time.

This design has subsequently been compared to other highly nonlinear fibers in order to highlight the effect of both using soft glass and the design and optimization technique. Modelled fiber performance shows squeezing of phase noise in a 5 m length of fiber with 32 dBm total power in the signal and pumps.

The discrete-wavelet-transform-based (DWT) RE scheme generates artifacts (due to a DWT shift-variant property). A wavelet-domain approach based on dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) and nonlocal means (NLM) is proposed for RE of the satellite images. A satellite input image is decomposed by DT-CWT (which is nearly shift invariant) to obtain high-frequency subbands. The high-frequency subbands and the low-resolution (LR) input image are interpolated using the Lanczos interpolator. The high-frequency subbands are passed through an NLM filter to cater for the artifacts generated by DT-CWT (despite of its nearly shift invariance). The filtered high-frequency subbands and the LR input image are combined using inverse DT-CWT to obtain a resolution-enhanced image. Objective and subjective analyses reveal superiority of the proposed technique over the conventional and state-of-the-art RE techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite Image Resolution Enhancement Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Nonlocal Means","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2012.2208616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6361358/06286987.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2208616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6286987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6286987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Satellite Image Resolution Enhancement Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Nonlocal Means","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6286987/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2012","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146562","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite Image Resolution Enhancement Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Nonlocal Means","sourcePdf":"lgrs-ghafoor-2208616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068798S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6361358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6361358","articleId":"6286987","onlineDate":"24 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6286990,"authors":[{"name":"Bi-Qiang Mu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bi-Qiang","lastName":"Mu","id":"38540863300"},{"name":"Han-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Han-Fu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281177500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6286990","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":701},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Kernel","MIMO","Approximation algorithms","Vectors","Approximation methods","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","convergence of numerical methods","Gaussian processes","linear systems","MIMO systems","nonlinear functions","random processes","recursive estimation","set theory","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive identification","MIMO Wiener systems","stochastic approximation algorithm","SA algorithm","multiinput and multioutput Wiener system","independent and identically distributed Gaussian random vectors","Gaussian random vectors","multivariable kernel functions","linear subsystem","nonlinear function convergence","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Wiener system","stochastic approximation","strong consistency","$\\alpha$ -mixing"]}],"abstract":"Stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms are proposed to identify a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) Wiener system, in which the system input is taken to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

This requirement can be implemented by reducing the number of electrons in the unselected NAND strings prior to programming. By applying negative bias to all the word lines in the selected block, excess electrons can be removed from the channel and source/drain regions into the bit line or the source line using drift and diffusion mechanisms, and also electrons in the surface states can be recombined with accumulated holes before programming. After the pretreatment of electron reduction in the NAND string, a normal NAND program sequence follows. The advantage of the pretreatment before programming has been verified by measuring the 8-Gb NAND Flash memory with a 50-nm technology node. Significant reduction of the threshold voltage shift was observed even after the severe program disturb stress, which corresponds to around 30 times of the programming of the 2 bit/cell operation.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2012.2208462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/6305505/06287010.pdf","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2208462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6305505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Programming Scheme for the Improvement of Program Disturb Characteristics in Scaled nand Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"A New Programming Scheme for the Improvement of Program Disturb Characteristics in Scaled nand Flash Memory","volume":"59","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2012","accessionNumber":"12998910","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287010/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287010/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Programming Scheme for the Improvement of Program Disturb Characteristics in Scaled nand Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"ted-shirota-2208462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117311S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6305505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6305505","articleId":"6287010","onlineDate":"24 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6287012,"authors":[{"name":"Ashvini Gyanathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6334462/6287012/6287012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashvini Gyanathan received the B.Eng.

In the case of the white Gaussian channel it is known that the minimum error probability, under the average power constraint, decreases faster than the exponential of any order. Recently Gallager and Nakibo\u011flu (2010) proposed a coding scheme for the white Gaussian channel and successfully showed the multiple-exponential decay of the error probability for all rates below capacity. This paper aims to prove that, without any special assumptions on the noise of the stationary Gaussian channel, the minimum error probability decreases multiple-exponentially fast. In general, no explicit formulas are known for the capacity of the stationary Gaussian channel. In this paper, we introduce a lower bound \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">*</sup>\n on the capacity \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>\n.

Control objectives of dc microgrid are: 1) to ensure equal load sharing (in per unit) among sources; and 2) to maintain low-voltage regulation of the system. Conventional droop controllers are not effective in achieving both the aforementioned objectives simultaneously. Reasons for this are identified to be the error in nominal voltages and load distribution. Though centralized controller achieves these objectives, it requires high-speed communication and offers less reliability due to single point of failure. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new decentralized controller for dc microgrid. Key advantages are high reliability, low-voltage regulation, and equal load sharing, utilizing low-bandwidth communication. To evaluate the dynamic performance, mathematical model of the scheme is derived. Stability of the system is evaluated by eigenvalue analysis. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified through a detailed simulation study. To confirm the viability of the scheme, experimental studies are carried out on a laboratory prototype developed for this purpose. Controller area network protocol is utilized to achieve communication between the sources.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6341145/06287047.pdf","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Control to Ensure Proportional Load Sharing and Improve Voltage Regulation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Control to Ensure Proportional Load Sharing and Improve Voltage Regulation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287047/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287047/","volume":"28","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Control to Ensure Proportional Load Sharing and Improve Voltage Regulation in Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpel-anand-2215055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086301S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6341145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"564","xplore-issue":"6341145","articleId":"6287047","onlineDate":"24 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6287050,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Pulsewidth modulations (PWMs) for the independently controlled inverters are implemented using a simple effective time placement affected by offset-time concept, thus, eliminating the use of sector identification and lookup tables. Analytical expressions for ripple content in the motor phase current are developed and a current trajectory is theoretically obtained directly from the switching states of the dual inverter in a stationary reference frame. In addition, this paper also describes a current ripple trajectory in the motor by exploring the freedom of independently operating the individual inverters with different PWMs. Based on the analysis, discontinuous PWMs are employed for the individually inverters that not only offer the advantage of reducing the total switching commutations in the inverters but also reduces the current ripple. Analytical expression for the RMS ripple current and variation in RMS ripple current in one cycle of operation for different PWMs are also presented for the entire speed range of the dual-inverter drive. The performance of the dual-inverter drive with the proposed PWM variants is first studied analytically and then verified by performing suitable experiments on a 1-kW open-end winding induction motor drive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discontinuous Decoupled PWMs for Reduced Current Ripple in a Dual Two-Level Inverter Fed Open-End Winding Induction Motor Drive","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215344","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6361328/06287050.pdf","startPage":"2493","endPage":"2502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Discontinuous Decoupled PWMs for Reduced Current Ripple in a Dual Two-Level Inverter Fed Open-End Winding Induction Motor Drive","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6287050/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discontinuous Decoupled PWMs for Reduced Current Ripple in a Dual Two-Level Inverter Fed Open-End Winding Induction Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"tpel-srirama-2215344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045885S","chronDate":"May  2013","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"78","articleId":"6287050","onlineDate":"24 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6287063,"authors":[{"name":"Jayita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6287055/6287063/6287063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jayita Das (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India in 2004.

Apart from writing and reading, nanomagnets are also clocked using external magnetic fields generated by current carrying wires. The related current ranges in mA and consumes large power. Also, the fields cannot sharply terminate at boundaries between nanomagnets that are required to be in different clock zones. The above concerns motivated us to look into alternate magnetic devices to realize magnetic logic. We therefore suggested miltilayer magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) for logic. We have observed that MTJ free layers can interact with their neighbors through magnetic coupling. In this paper we have proposed use of this coupling for effective logic computation. MTJs are also CMOS friendly, a property that we used to write, clock and read from logic. CMOS integration also improves control over individual elements in logic. In this paper we have used these properties to present a novel CMOS-MTJ integrated architecture that: a) computes logic using magnetic coupling between MTJs and b) writes, clocks and reads from logic using spin transfer torque (STT) current that is more energy efficient. A feasibility study of this CMOS-MTJ integration in 22 nm CMOS technology node is also presented. The proposed architecture achieves an energy reduction >;95% in adders and multipliers when compared to traditional designs using single layer nanomagnets.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6287055/06287063.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2012.2185311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287055","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Low Power Hybrid CMOS-Magnetic Logic Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Low Power Hybrid CMOS-Magnetic Logic Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"12961061","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287063/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Low Power Hybrid CMOS-Magnetic Logic Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcsi-bhanja-2185311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10073S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6287055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6287055","articleId":"6287063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6287127,"authors":[{"name":"Ramli Adnan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ramli","lastName":"Adnan","id":"37320645400"},{"name":"Fazlina Ahmat Ruslan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Fazlina Ahmat","lastName":"Ruslan","id":"38073005000"},{"name":"Abd Manan Samad","affiliation":["Center for Surveying Science and Geomatics, Faculty of Arc., Planning and Surveying, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abd Manan","lastName":"Samad","id":"37312408700"},{"name":"Zainazlan Md Zain","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zainazlan","lastName":"Md Zain","id":"37546260300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2036-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2035-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2034-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6287127","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Floods","Rivers","Kalman filters","Predictive models","Forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","floods","forecasting theory","geophysics computing","Kalman filters","mean square error methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flood water level modelling","artificial neural network","Sungai Batu Pahat","flood water level prediction","forecasting problems","early warning system","backpropagation neural network","BPN","extended Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back Propagation Neural Network","Flood Water Level Forecasting","Mean Squared Error","Correlation Coefficient","Error Goal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287127","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269158/6287117/06287127.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flood water level modelling and prediction using artificial neural network: Case study of Sungai Batu Pahat in Johor","abstract":"Flood water level prediction has long been the earliest forecasting problems that have attracted the interest of many researchers.

The cell is combined with a simple current mirror summing node to produce biologically plausible postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A single charge packet is effectively transferred from the synapse to the summing node, whenever a presynaptic pulse is applied to one of its terminals. The charge packet is \u201cweighted\u201d by a voltage applied to the second terminal of the synapse. A voltage applied to the third terminal determines the charge recovery time in the synapse, which can be adjusted over several orders of magnitude. This voltage determines the paired pulse ratio for the synapse. The fall time of the PSP is also adjustable and is set by the gate voltage of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor operating in subthreshold. Results extracted from chips fabricated in a 0.35-\u03bcm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, alongside theoretical and simulation results, confirm the ability of the cell to produce PSPs that are characteristic of real synapses. The concept addresses a key requirement for scalable hardware neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2211035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6298049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2211035","endPage":"1525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6298049/06287129.pdf","startPage":"1513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon-Based Dynamic Synapse With Depressing Response","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287129/","displayDocTitle":"Silicon-Based Dynamic Synapse With Depressing Response","volume":"23","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12982128","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2012","pubMedId":"24807998","htmlLink":"/document/6287129/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon-Based Dynamic Synapse With Depressing Response","sourcePdf":"tnnls-dowrick-2211035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168218S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6298049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6298049","articleId":"6287129","onlineDate":"24 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6287140,"authors":[{"name":"Kumar Abhishek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT Patna, India"],"firstName":"Kumar","lastName":"Abhishek","id":"38469233400"},{"name":"Abhay Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, NIT Patna, India"],"firstName":"Abhay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38469287000"},{"name":"Rajeev Ranjan","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, NIT Patna, India"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"38469171100"},{"name":"Sarthak Kumar","affiliation":["Deolitte India, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Sarthak","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38469111900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2036-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2035-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2034-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6287140","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2699},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Neurons","Prediction algorithms","Predictive models","Testing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","geophysics computing","multilayer perceptrons","rain","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rainfall prediction model","multilayered artificial neural network","back-propagation algorithm configuration","learning cycle","back-propagation-feed forward neural network","data sets","Udupi district of Karnataka","artificial neural network based predictive models","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monsoon rainfall","Udupi","prediction","artificial neural network","back propagation algorithm","multilayer artificial neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287140","abstract":"The multilayered artificial neural network with learning by back-propagation algorithm configuration is the most common in use, due to of its ease in training. It is estimated that over 80% of all the neural network projects in development use back-propagation. In back-propagation algorithm, there are two phases in its learning cycle, one to propagate the input patterns through the network and other to adapt the output by changing the weights in the network. The back-propagation-feed forward neural network can be used in many applications such as character recognition, weather and financial prediction, face detection etc. The paper implements one of these applications by building training and testing data sets and finding the number of hidden neurons in these layers for the best performance. In the present research, possibility of predicting average rainfall over Udupi district of Karnataka has been analyzed through artificial neural network models. In formulating artificial neural network based predictive models three layered network has been constructed.

One key enhancement feature is bandwidth extension by the use of multicarrier technology to support deployment bandwidth up to 100 MHz. In order to achieve up to 1 Gb/s peak data rate in IMT-Advanced mobile systems, carrier aggregation technology is introduced by the 3GPP to support very-high-data-rate transmissions over wide frequency bandwidths (e.g., up to 100 MHz) in its new LTE-Advanced standards. The carrier aggregation (CA) technology allows scalable expansion of effective bandwidth provided to a user terminal through simultaneous utilization of radio resources across multiple carriers. The CA in LTE-Advanced is designed to support aggregation of a variety of different arrangements of component carriers (CCs), including CCs of the same or different bandwidths, contiguous or non- contiguous CCs in the same frequency band, and CCs in different frequency bands. The CA is supported by both formats of LTE, specifically the frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) variants. This guarantees that both FDD LTE and TDD LTE are able to meet the high data throughput requirements placed upon them. This paper provides an outline of carrier aggregation including aggregation structure, deployment scenarios, implementation, main design features and backward compatibility with legacy LTE systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier aggregation in Long Term Evolution-Advanced","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","doi":"10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287153","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269158/6287117/06287153.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Carrier aggregation in Long Term Evolution-Advanced","conferenceDate":"16-17 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287153/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12964150","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier aggregation in Long Term Evolution-Advanced","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0029ID73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06399S","chronDate":"16-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269158","isNumber":"6287117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269158","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6287117","articleId":"6287153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287156,"authors":[{"name":"Ramli Adnan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ramli","lastName":"Adnan","id":"37320645400"},{"name":"Fazlina Ahmat Ruslan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Fazlina Ahmat","lastName":"Ruslan","id":"38073005000"},{"name":"Abd Manan Samad","affiliation":["Department of Surveying Science and Geomatics, Faculty of Arc., Planning and Surveying, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abd Manan","lastName":"Samad","id":"37312408700"},{"name":"Zainazlan Md Zain","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zainazlan","lastName":"Md Zain","id":"37546260300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2036-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2035-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2034-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6287156","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Equations","Mathematical model","Floods","Prediction algorithms","Time measurement","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floods","forecasting theory","Kalman filters","level measurement","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended Kalman filter","EKF prediction","flood water level estimation","forecasts","nonlinear problems","flood phenomenon","root mean square error","RMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kalman Filter","Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)","Tracking and Prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287156","abstract":"This paper addresses Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm that is uses to predict and estimate flood water level.

This theory is also supported with the simulation results that produce small value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) which is close to zero.","doi":"10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287156","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269158/6287117/06287156.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) prediction of flood water level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) prediction of flood water level","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12964153","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287156/","conferenceDate":"16-17 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) prediction of flood water level","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0032ID79.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042806S","chronDate":"16-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269158","isNumber":"6287117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269158","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6287117","articleId":"6287156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6287165,"authors":[{"name":"Nurul Fatihah Jusoh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nurul Fatihah","lastName":"Jusoh","id":"37543140000"},{"name":"Muhammad Adib Haron","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Adib","lastName":"Haron","id":"38611493700"},{"name":"Fuziah Sulaiman","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Fuziah","lastName":"Sulaiman","id":"37329035500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2036-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2035-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2034-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6287165","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"abstract":"To meet the standard modern system communication demands, the paper represents the implementation of bidirectional shift converter technique for the embedded converter RS232 to Universal Serial Bus circuit block within FPGA using Verilog HDL language to be applied in a system wireless communication within Zigbee protocol.

Both methods could be used for many applications including for recording heritage building. This study is carried out to investigate the combination of two photogrammetric methods i.e aerial photogrammetry which utilizes light weight rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and terrestrial photogrammetry for the production of 3D heritage building. In this study, a building is simulated as a heritage building located in the precinct of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The UAV was used to acquire the digital aerial images of the building and its' surrounding where the UAV is equipped with high resolution digital camera. For terrestrial photogrammetry, the digital images of the building facades are acquired from the ground using the similar high resolution digital camera. For accurate measurement, the high resolution digital camera is calibrated and later the recovered parameters are used for digital image processing. Surrounding and on the fa\u00e7ades of the building, ground control points (GCP) and control points (CP) are established respectively using total station. The GCP is used in image processing of aerial photogrammetry to produce the orthophoto and foot print of the building. For the CP it is used in image processing of terrestrial photogrammetry to produce 3D model of the building. Then the results from both methods are combined together where the 3D model of the building is placed on the footprint of the building in the orthophoto. In conclusion, product of geomatic has been used by archeologist for decades, however, product such as 3D building could assist archeologist to produce better recoding of a heritage building.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 July 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287166/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12964163","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integration of low altitude aerial & terrestrial photogrammetry data in 3D heritage building modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of low altitude aerial & terrestrial photogrammetry data in 3D heritage building modeling","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0042ID89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056631S","chronDate":"16-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269158","isNumber":"6287117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269158","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287117","articleId":"6287166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6287186,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result, the hypertrophic condition of the heart often revealed itself in the form of abnormal sinus rhythm that can be detected via an electrocardiogram (ECG). In order to reduce the risk of misinterpretation by cardiologists, a variety of computational methods have been suggested for automated classification of arrhythmias. This paper proposes to explore Elman neural network for detecting cardiomyopathy. A total of 600 ECG beat samples were acquired from an established online database. Initially, the signals were filtered to eliminate high-frequency interference and perform baseline rectification. Nine time-based descriptors from leads I, II and III were used for training, testing and validation of the network structures. A total of five hidden-node node structures were tested with four different learning algorithms. Results show that all the network structure managed to achieve more than 90% classification accuracy. The fastest convergence was achieved with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with an average of 16 epochs.","doi":"10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287186","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269158/6287117/06287186.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"332","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGRC.2012.6287186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on Elman neural network for detection of cardiomyopathy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on Elman neural network for detection of cardiomyopathy","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12964183","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287186/","conferenceDate":"16-17 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on Elman neural network for detection of cardiomyopathy","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0062ID115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055584S","chronDate":"16-17 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269158","isNumber":"6287117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269158","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6287117","articleId":"6287186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6287485,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Gui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gui","id":"38109170100"},{"name":"Guixia Kang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guixia","lastName":"Kang","id":"37290963700"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for the Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6287485","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference constraints","Quantization","Robustness","Vectors","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","cognitive radio","linear codes","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding","quantisation (signal)","radio spectrum management","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser cognitive MIMO system","linear precoding design","cognitive multiinput multioutput system","CR MIMO system","secondary broadcast channel","spectrum","primary user","PU","cooperative feedback","local feedback","secondary user","SU","secondary transmitter","ST","minimum mean square error","MMSE criteria","channel uncertainties","quantization error","interference constraint","precoder design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive MIMO","cooperative feedback","minimum mean square error"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we present a linear precoder design scheme for a cognitive (CR) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, where a secondary broadcast channel uses the same spectrum with multiple primary users (PUs).

In this letter, we present and evaluate a simple technique to perform packet aggregation in IEEE 802.11ac MU-MIMO (Multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output) WLANs. Results show that in non-saturation conditions both the number of active stations (STAs) and the queue size have a significant impact on the system performance. If the number of STAs is excessively high, the heterogeneity of destinations in the packets contained in the queue makes it difficult to take full advantage of packet aggregation.

This method is robust because it does not need the feedback of channel state information (CSI) to the transmitter and does not assume that the number of Eve's antennas should be smaller than that of Bob. Furthermore, we propose a new concept of outage secrecy region to evaluate the secrecy performance from a geometrical perspective. This should be useful if we need to know what zone should be protected (or militarized).

We prove that, in contrast to the case of Gaussian two-way channel (GTWC) where the two bounds coincide thus establishing its capacity region, the two bounds of AF-TWRC do not coincide unless both terminals are noise-free, due to that the intermediate relay node introduces additional power constraint relating to the correlation of channel inputs from both terminals. This indicates that the capacity region of non-restricted Gaussian AF-TWRC, which was previously believed to be already established in a way similar to that of GTWC, still remains open.

We propose a sparsity model that allows the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) for the online recovery of large data sets in real WSN scenarios, exploiting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of real signals. Bayesian analysis is utilized to approximate the statistical distribution of the principal components and to show that the Laplacian distribution provides an accurate representation of the statistics of real data. This combined CS and PCA technique is subsequently integrated into a novel framework, namely, SCoRe1: Sensing, Compression and Recovery through ON-line Estimation for WSNs. SCoRe1 is able to effectively self-adapt to unpredictable changes in the signal statistics thanks to a feedback control loop that estimates, in real time, the signal reconstruction error. We also propose an extensive validation of the framework used in conjunction with CS as well as with standard interpolation techniques, testing its performance for real world signals.

In TR-OFDM, the use of passive time reversal processing offers a simple means of reducing channel time dispersion. Consequently, a cyclic prefix (CP) with a length shorter than the channel order can be used without inducing much inter-block interference (IBI). This paper tackles a technical challenge critical to the success of TR-OFDM, that is, how to minimize the CP length while satisfying certain performance requirements. Based on a data model derived for TR-OFDM, a quantitative relationship between the CP length and error performance is first established and a design procedure is then proposed. Our design reveals that the optimal CP length depends on the power delay profiles of underlying channels. Our design also leads to new insight in the time reversal operation and helps identify channel situations where TR-OFDM might not work effectively. The merits of our design are confirmed by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Cyclic Prefix Length for Time-Reversed OFDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.081612.120172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6333589/06287525.pdf","startPage":"3723","endPage":"3733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.081612.120172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6333589","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Cyclic Prefix Length for Time-Reversed OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6287525/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","publicationDate":"October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057135","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Cyclic Prefix Length for Time-Reversed OFDM","sourcePdf":"3723-tw1210-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07923S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6333589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6333589","articleId":"6287525","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6287527,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Shin Jo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Control Engineering, Hanbat National University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6333589/6287527/6287527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han-Shin Jo (S'06, M'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, 2004, and 2009, respectively.

The HCN is modeled as a multi-tier cellular network where each tier's base stations (BSs) are randomly located and have a particular transmit power, path loss exponent, spatial density, and bias towards admitting mobile users. For example, as compared to macrocells, picocells would usually have lower transmit power, higher path loss exponent (lower antennas), higher spatial density (many picocells per macrocell), and a positive bias so that macrocell users are actively encouraged to use the more lightly loaded picocells. In the present paper we implicitly assume all base stations have full queues; future work should relax this. For this model, we derive the outage probability of a typical user in the whole network or a certain tier, which is equivalently the downlink SINR cumulative distribution function. The results are accurate for all SINRs, and their expressions admit quite simple closed-forms in some plausible special cases. We also derive the average ergodic rate of the typical user, and the minimum average user throughput - the smallest value among the average user throughputs supported by one cell in each tier. We observe that neither the number of BSs or tiers changes the outage probability or average ergodic rate in an interference-limited full-loaded HCN with unbiased cell association (no biasing), and observe how biasing alters the various metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2012.081612.111361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2012.081612.111361","startPage":"3484","endPage":"3495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6333589/06287527.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6333589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Cellular Networks with Flexible Cell Association: A Comprehensive Downlink SINR Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Cellular Networks with Flexible Cell Association: A Comprehensive Downlink SINR Analysis","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13057137","publicationDate":"October 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287527/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Cellular Networks with Flexible Cell Association: A Comprehensive Downlink SINR Analysis","sourcePdf":"3484-tw1210-jo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157773S","chronDate":"October  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6333589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"804","xplore-issue":"6333589","articleId":"6287527","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6287529,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-Ho Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6333589/6287529/6287529-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyun-Ho Lee (S'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the school of electrical engineering.

The general model is not only exemplified by the Time-Reversed Space-Time Block Code (TR-STBC) scheme, but also by the Asynchronous Cooperative Liner Dispersion Codes (ACLDC) scheme. In these schemes a guard interval has to be inserted between adjacent transmission blocks to mitigate the effect of ISI. Consequently, this could degrade the effective symbol rate for a small block size. A larger block size would enhance the effective symbol rate and also substantially increase the decoding complexity. In the general model proposed in this paper, we further present a novel low-complexity breadth-adjustable tree-search algorithm and compare it with Sphere-Decoding (SD) based algorithms. With simulation results we will illustrate that our algorithm is able to achieve the optimal performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) with a complexity much lower than the SD-based algorithms, whether the ACLDC or TR-STBC scheme is employed. Through simulations we further demonstrate that when the block size of the ACLDC is equivalent to 20, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is only a fraction of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-8</sup>\n that of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm.

Thus, CS appears to be an excellent technique for data acquisition and reconstruction in a wireless sensor network (WSN) which typically employs a smart fusion center (FC) with a high computational capability and several dumb front-end sensors having limited energy storage. This paper presents a novel signal reconstruction method based on CS principles for applications in WSNs. The proposed method exploits both the intra-sensor and inter-sensor correlation to reduce the number of samples required for reconstruction of the original signals. The novelty of the method relates to the use of the Frechet mean of the signals as an estimate of their sparse representations in some basis. This crude estimate of the sparse representation is then utilized in an enhanced data recovering convex algorithm, i.e., the penalized \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization, and an enhanced data recovering greedy algorithm, i.e., the precognition matching pursuit (PMP).

A major concern in such networks is energy efficiency because gas sensors are power-hungry, and the sensor node must operate unattended for several years on a battery power supply. A system with aggressive energy management at the sensor level, node level, and network level is presented. The node is designed with very low sleep current consumption (only 8 \u03bcA), and it contains a metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor and a pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor. Furthermore, the network is multimodal; it exploits information from auxiliary sensors, such as PIR sensors about the presence of people and from the neighbor nodes about gas concentration to modify the behavior of the node and the measuring frequency of the gas concentration. In this way, we reduce the nodes' activity and energy requirements, while simultaneously providing a reliable service. To evaluate our approach and the benefits of the context-aware adaptive sampling, we simulate an application scenario which demonstrates a significant lifetime extension (several years) compared to the continuously-driven gas sensor. In March 2012, we deployed the WSN with 36 nodes in a four-story building and by now the performance has confirmed models and expectations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Adaptive Multimodal Wireless Sensor Network for Energy-Efficient Gas Monitoring","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2012.2215733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6376138/06287540.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2012.2215733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6376138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Context-Adaptive Multimodal Wireless Sensor Network for Energy-Efficient Gas Monitoring","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6287540/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13196452","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Adaptive Multimodal Wireless Sensor Network for Energy-Efficient Gas Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jsen-jelicic-2215733-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208848S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6376138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6376138","articleId":"6287540","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6287548,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Ding","id":"37625396600"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Ding","id":"37270937600"},{"name":"Chi Fang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Fang","id":"37270031200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6287548","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1149},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Face","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Facial features","Databases","Fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image resolution","pose estimation","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous pose normalization","pose-robust face recognition","continuous pose variations","automatic pose normalization algorithm","pose-dependent correspondences","2D facial feature points","3D face model","multiview random forest embedded active shape model","CMU-PIE database","FERET database","CAS-PEAL database","facial symmetry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","pose normalization"]}],"abstract":"Pose variation is a great challenge for robust face recognition. In this paper, we present a fully automatic pose normalization algorithm that can handle continuous pose variations and achieve high face recognition accuracy. First, an automatic method is proposed to find pose-dependent correspondences between 2-D facial feature points and 3-D face model. This method is based on a multi-view random forest embedded active shape model. Then we densely map each pixel in the face image onto the 3-D face model and rotate it to the frontal view. The filling of occluded face regions is guided by facial symmetry. Recognition experiments were conducted on the two western databases CMU-PIE, FERET and one eastern database CAS-PEAL. Currently the algorithm has been trained with pose variation up to \u00b150\u00b0 in yaw. Our algorithm not only achieves high recognition accuracy for learnt poses but also shows good generalizability for extreme poses. Furthermore, it suggests the promising application to people of different races.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2215586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6296742/06287548.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2012.2215586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Pose Normalization for Pose-Robust Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287548/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Pose Normalization for Pose-Robust Face Recognition","volume":"19","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","accessionNumber":"13012080","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287548/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Pose Normalization for Pose-Robust Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-ding-2215586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061053S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6296742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6296742","articleId":"6287548","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6287557,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Ferrer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications (iTEAM), Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Val\u00e9ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6334458/6287557/6287557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Ferrer (M'04) was born in Almer\u00eda, Spain, in 1974.

The presented technique aims to reduce the distortion in the Mel filter-bank energy estimation due to the harmonic composition of voiced speech intervals and DFT (discrete Fourier transform) sampling when the central frequency of band-pass filters is shifted. This paper also proposes an analytical maximum likelihood (ML) method to estimate the optimal warping factor in the cepstral space. The presented interpolated filter-bank energy-based VTLN leads to relative reductions in WER (word error rate) as high as 11.2% and 7.6% when compared with the baseline system and standard VTLN, respectively, in a medium-vocabulary continuous speech recognition task. Also, the proposed VTLN scheme can provide significant reductions in WER when compared with state-of-the-art VTLN methods based on linear transforms in the cepstral feature-space. The warping factor estimated with the proposed VTLN approach shows more dependence on the speaker and more independence of the acoustic-phonetic content than the warping factor resulting from standard and state-of-the-art VTLN methods. Finally, the analytical ML-based optimization scheme presented here achieves almost the same reductions in WER as the ML grid search version of the technique with a computational load 20 times lower.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2012.2215590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2012.2215590","startPage":"110","endPage":"121","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6334458/06287560.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6334458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Reducing Harmonic and Sampling Distortion in Vocal Tract Length Normalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"On Reducing Harmonic and Sampling Distortion in Vocal Tract Length Normalization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287560/","accessionNumber":"13061957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287560/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Reducing Harmonic and Sampling Distortion in Vocal Tract Length Normalization","sourcePdf":"tasl-yoma-2215590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072248S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6334458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","xplore-issue":"6334458","articleId":"6287560","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":6287563,"authors":[{"name":"Wang-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wang-Soo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38065194800"},{"name":"Chang-Kyung Seong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Limited, Yongin si, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chang-Kyung","lastName":"Seong","id":"37667584200"},{"name":"Woo-Young Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281363600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6287563","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Clocks","Adaptive equalizers","Monitoring","Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","CMOS integrated circuits","filtering theory","printed circuits","random sequences","reliability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive continuous-time linear equalizer","asynchronous undersampling histograms","CTLE","optimal equalizing filter coefficient","clock synchronization","CMOS technology","pseudorandom bit sequence data","PCB traces","DisplayPort cable","statistical analysis","reliability","bit rate 5.4 Gbit/s","size 0.13 mum","size 40 cm","size 80 cm","size 120 cm","size 3 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive equalization","asynchronous undersampling histogram","continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE)"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate a new type of adaptive continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) based on asynchronous undersampling histograms.

In this paper, we review most of the techniques that have been applied to the use of the electrocardiogram for biometric recognition. In particular, we categorize the methodologies based on the features and the classification schemes. Finally, a comparative analysis of the authentication performance of a few of the ECG biometric systems is presented, using our inhouse database. The comparative study includes the cases where training and testing data come from the same and different sessions (days). The authentication results show that most of the algorithms that have been proposed for ECG-based biometrics perform well when the training and testing data come from the same session. However, when training and testing data come from different sessions, a performance degradation occurs. Multiple training sessions were incorporated to diminish the loss in performance. That notwithstanding, only a few of the proposed ECG recognition algorithms appear to be able to support performance improvement due to multiple training sessions. Only three of these algorithms produced equal error rates (EERs) in the single digits, including an EER of 5.5% using a method proposed by us.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2215324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6342844/06287579.pdf","startPage":"1812","endPage":"1824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2215324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Biometric Recognition: A Comparative Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287579/","displayDocTitle":"ECG Biometric Recognition: A Comparative Analysis","volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136030","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287579/","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Biometric Recognition: A Comparative Analysis","sourcePdf":"tifs-odinaka-2215324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.190016S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6287579","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":6287580,"authors":[{"name":"Raef Bassily","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6342844/6287580/6287580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raef Bassily (M'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering and the M.S. degree in engineering mathematics from Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

We decompose the channel from the helper to the eavesdropper into two orthogonal components: one is aligned in the direction of the channel between the helper and the legitimate receiver (direct component) and the other is in the orthogonal direction to the channel between the helper and the legitimate receiver (orthogonal component). We then propose a strategy in which the helper uses the orthogonal component to transmit pure Gaussian noise as in the CJ strategy while he uses the direct component for either CJ or NF depending on the given channel conditions. We explicitly derive the optimal power control policy for this strategy and give the achievable secrecy rates when the direct component is used to perform CJ or NF. We hence derive the channel conditions where CJ is better than NF over the direct component and vice-versa. Finally, we consider the reversely degraded multiple antenna relay-eavesdropper channel. We show that a simple strategy in which the relay jams with full power along the orthogonal component and transmits nothing in the direct component achieves a secrecy rate that approaches the secrecy capacity of this channel as the relay's average power goes to infinity. Moreover, we show that this result holds almost surely even if the relay-eavesdropper's channel state information is unavailable.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6342844/06287580.pdf","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2012.2215325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2012.2215325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342844","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deaf Cooperation for Secrecy With Multiple Antennas at the Helper","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Antennas","Jamming","Receivers","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","cooperative communication","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","jamming","radio receivers","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deaf cooperation","cooperative jamming","CJ","noise forwarding","NF","secrecy rate","Gaussian wiretap channel","GWT","helper node","orthogonal component","legitimate receiver","Gaussian noise","channel condition","optimal power control policy","multiple antenna relay-eavesdropper channel","relay jam","channel secrecy capacity","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel decomposition","cooperative jamming","information theoretic secrecy","multiple antennas","noise forwarding","relay-eavesdropper channel","reversely degraded channel","secrecy rates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Deaf Cooperation for Secrecy With Multiple Antennas at the Helper","volume":"7","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6287580/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13136031","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deaf Cooperation for Secrecy With Multiple Antennas at the Helper","sourcePdf":"tifs-ulukus-2215325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084769S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6342844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6342844","articleId":"6287580","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6287586,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangsheng Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6392254/6287586/6287586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangsheng Huang received the B.S. degree in material science and the M.S. degree in computer science from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1998 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2005.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The DSR maps heterogeneous face images into a common discriminative subspace in which robust classification can be achieved. In the proposed method, the subspace learning problem is transformed into a least squares problem. Different mappings should map heterogeneous images from the same class close to each other, while images from different classes should be separated as far as possible. To realize this, we introduce two novel regularization terms, which reflect the category relationships among data, into the least squares approach.

However, the known robust fractal coding methods (HFIC and LAD-FIC, etc.) are not optimal, since, besides the high computational cost, they use the corrupted domain block as the independent variable in the robust regression model, which may adversely affect the robust estimator to calculate the fractal parameters (depending on the noise level). This paper presents a Huber fitting plane-based fractal image coding (HFPFIC) method. This method builds Huber fitting planes (HFPs) for the domain and range blocks, respectively, ensuring the use of an uncorrupted independent variable in the robust model. On this basis, a new matching error function is introduced to robustly evaluate the best scaling factor. Meanwhile, a median absolute deviation (MAD) about the median decomposition criterion is proposed to achieve fast adaptive quadtree partitioning for the image corrupted by salt & pepper noise. In order to reduce computational cost, the no-search method is applied to speedup the encoding process. Experimental results show that the proposed HFPFIC can yield superior performance over conventional robust fractal image coding methods in encoding speed and the quality of the restored image. Furthermore, the no-search method can significantly reduce encoding time and achieve less than 2.0 s for the HFPFIC with acceptable image quality degradation. In addition, we show that, combined with the MAD decomposition scheme, the HFP technique used as a robust method can further reduce the encoding time while maintaining image quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13188886","pubMedId":"22949061","htmlLink":"/document/6287587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Huber Fractal Image Coding Based on a Fitting Plane","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Huber Fractal Image Coding Based on a Fitting Plane","sourcePdf":"tip-lu-2215619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067613S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6392254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6392254","articleId":"6287587","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6287592,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Greenhalgh","affiliation":["Visual Information Laboratory, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6357363/6287592/6287592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jack Greenhalgh received the M.Eng. degree in computer systems engineering from the University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K., in 2010.

The goal is to control a team of AUVs to reach all appointed target locations for only one time on the premise of workload balance and energy sufficiency while guaranteeing the least total and individual consumption in the presence of the variable ocean current. First, the SOM neuron network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in 3-D ocean environment. The working process involves special definition of the initial neural weights of the SOM network, the rule to select the winner, the computation of the neighborhood function, and the method to update weights. Then, the velocity synthesis approach is applied to plan the shortest path for each AUV to visit the corresponding target in a dynamic environment subject to the ocean current being variable and targets being movable.

These systems use a large network of sensor nodes that are laid on the ocean floor to collectively gather and transmit seismic information. In particular, underwater wireless sensor networks are gaining prominence in continuous seismic monitoring of undersea oilfields. They are autonomous and use wireless acoustic transmission for transferring data. However, the deployment period of such networks extends well beyond the battery lifetimes of the nodes. Hence, to ensure continuous monitoring from all node locations, it is required to replace the energy-depleted nodes on the ocean floor. Replacing these nodes at remote undersea locations is very expensive, and hence, the total node replacement cost in large seismic node networks is extremely high. In this paper, we develop effective joint policies involving routing and node replacement decisions to minimize the replacement costs per unit time. Our routing approach is simple and suitable for this application, and it strives for energy efficiency at all times. We propose a few node-replacement policies and compare their performances when they are combined with our proposed routings.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2012.2208850","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6407497/06287606.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6407497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2012.2208850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"80","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Routing and Node Replacement in Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks for Seismic Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Combined Routing and Node Replacement in Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks for Seismic Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287606/","volume":"38","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6287606/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13218945","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Routing and Node Replacement in Energy-Efficient Underwater Sensor Networks for Seismic Monitoring","sourcePdf":"joe-mohapatra-2208850-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067363S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6407497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6407497","articleId":"6287606","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287616,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Zhu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, School of Information Science and Engineering, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6314489/6287616/6287616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Zhu (S'12) was born in Zhejiang Province, China, on April 5, 1987.

SICL is a shielded planar coaxial line, which is very suitable for wideband and high-speed applications due to its broad unimodal operation band, low insertion loss, very small dispersion, and easy integration with other planar circuits. In order to achieve wider bandwidth and better VSWR performance of the SICL balun, a pair of quarter-wave impedance transformers are inserted into the balanced line. The impedance characteristics of the proposed SICL baluns are analyzed, and the parameters that determine the balun bandwidth are discussed. Then, curves of the balun resistance, reactance, and the SICL characteristic impedance are presented. According to these curves, the design parameters of the proposed SICL baluns can easily be determined. To verify these ideas, an UWB SICL single balun and an UWB SICL dual balun are designed, fabricated, and measured. Both full-wave simulated and measured results are presented, and good agreement between them is observed. The proposed SICL baluns have a simple structure and good performance, which are suitable for applications in UWB communication systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2209448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314489","startPage":"3062","endPage":"3070","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6314489/06287616.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Single and Dual Baluns Based on Substrate Integrated Coaxial Line Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287616/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Wideband Single and Dual Baluns Based on Substrate Integrated Coaxial Line Technology","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030678","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Wideband Single and Dual Baluns Based on Substrate Integrated Coaxial Line Technology","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhu-2209448-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070546S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6314489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6314489","articleId":"6287616","onlineDate":"27 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6287619,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco de Leon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Francisco de Le\u00f3n (S'86\u2013M'92\u2013SM'02) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

In this paper, a new model based on hidden Markov model theory is presented for an electric arc. For this purpose, the characteristic of the arc voltage-current is divided into four regions. Then, on the basis of actual measured samples of an electric arc in several functioning cycles of EAF, different operating points are generated in the form of statistical probability, corresponding to hidden Markov theory in the aforementioned four regions. The arc model is designed in the form of a current-dependent voltage source. Therefore, the proposed model is without linear approximation and corresponds to the actual state.

singing voices from music accompaniment is an important task in many applications, such as music information retrieval, lyric recognition and alignment. Music accompaniment can be assumed to be in a low-rank subspace, because of its repetition structure; on the other hand, singing voices can be regarded as relatively sparse within songs. In this paper, based on this assumption, we propose using robust principal component analysis for singing-voice separation from music accompaniment. Moreover, we examine the separation result by using a binary time-frequency masking method. Evaluations on the MIR-1K dataset show that this method can achieve around 1~1.4 dB higher GNSDR compared with two state-of-the-art approaches without using prior training or requiring particular features.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287816","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287816/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966528","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Singing-voice separation from monaural recordings using robust principal component analysis","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089869S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6287824,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In order to estimate this difficulty even for examples without ground truth, a method motivated by selective sampling is applied. This method assigns a degree of difficulty to a sample based on the mutual disagreement between the output of various beat tracking systems. On a large beat annotated dataset we show that this mutual agreement is correlated with the mean performance of the beat trackers evaluated against the ground truth, and hence can be used to identify difficult examples by predicting poor beat tracking performance. Towards the aim of advancing future beat tracking systems, we demonstrate how our method can be used to form new datasets containing a high proportion of challenging music examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287824/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966536","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the automatic identification of difficult examples for beat tracking: Towards building new evaluation datasets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the automatic identification of difficult examples for beat tracking: Towards building new evaluation datasets","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048893S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6287827,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Sturmel","affiliation":["Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS UMR 7587, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Sturmel","id":"37646453800"},{"name":"Laurent Daudet","affiliation":["Institut Langevin, ESPCI, CNRS UMR 7587, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Daudet","id":"37332759400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287827","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectrogram","Real time systems","Time frequency analysis","Interference","Equations","Source separation","Phase estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","iterative methods","phase estimation","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative phase reconstruction","Wiener filtered signals","phase estimation","blind source separation","estimated spectrogram","Wiener mask","Griffin technique","Lim technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase reconstruction","Spectrogram","STFT","Blind source separation","Wiener filter"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative phase reconstruction of wiener filtered signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287827","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287827","startPage":"101","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","abstract":"This paper deals with phase estimation in the framework of underdetermined blind source separation, using an estimated spectrogram of the source and its associated Wiener filter.

TCS can exploit knowledge about the speech spectral structure. As a result, only one speech power estimate is needed for MMSE-based noise power estimation. Moreover, the presented estimator results in an improved noise tracking performance, especially in babble noise, where SNR improvements of 1dB over the original MMSE-based approach can be

In this framework, we start by formulating the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) criterion to retrieve each of the desired speech signals from the observed mixtures of sounds and outline the importance of multi-speaker activity detection. The latter is modeled by introducing a latent variable whose posterior probability is computed via expectation maximization (EM) combining both the spatial and spectral cues of the multichannel speech observations. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting joint blind source separation (BSS) and noise reduction solution performs remarkably well in reverberant and noisy environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287829","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"109","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multichannel MMSE-based framework for joint blind source separation and noise reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multichannel MMSE-based framework for joint blind source separation and noise reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287829/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966541","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6287829/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multichannel MMSE-based framework for joint blind source separation and noise reduction","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050791S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287830,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Schwarz","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schwarz","id":"38057551100"},{"name":"Klaus Reindl","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Reindl","id":"37391512200"},{"name":"Walter Kellermann","affiliation":["Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Kellermann","id":"37274601000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287830","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reverberation","Noise","Speech recognition","Speech","Microphones","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","speech recognition","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two channel reverberation suppression scheme","blind signal separation","Wiener filtering","blind signal extraction scheme","microphones","dereverberation","blocking matrix","recognition rate","automatic speech recognizer","GRID corpus","room impulse response","interference suppression","suppress reverberation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dereverberation","blind source separation","source extraction","speech enhancement"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we apply a blind signal extraction scheme for two microphones to the problem of dereverberation. The system consists of a blocking matrix that cancels the target signal as well as reverberated components up to a certain time lag, thus obtaining a reference not only for noise and interference, but also for late reverberation, which can then be suppressed with a Wiener filter, while leaving early reverberation components largely intact. The performance is assessed in terms of recognition rate of an automatic speech recognizer trained on clean speech, using sentences from the GRID corpus convolved with measured room impulse responses. We show that the system, although primarily developed for noise and interference suppression in low SNR conditions, can significantly suppress reverberation and thereby improve recognition results.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287830","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287830.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-channel reverberation suppression scheme based on blind signal separation and wiener filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287830/","displayDocTitle":"A two-channel reverberation suppression scheme based on blind signal separation and wiener filtering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966542","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287830/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-channel reverberation suppression scheme based on blind signal separation and wiener filtering","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062214S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287832,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian B\u00f6ck","affiliation":["Department of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"B\u00f6ck","id":"38469575400"},{"name":"Markus Schedl","affiliation":["Department of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Schedl","id":"37296901000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287832","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1149},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287832","abstract":"In this paper a new approach for polyphonic piano note onset transcription is presented.

The use of a single regression output layer instead of the often used one-versus-all classification approach enables the system to significantly lower the number of erroneous note detections.

Complicated scenarios comprising multiple sources, motivate the use of the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer (BF) and specifically its efficient generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) implementation. The complexity of applying the GSC is dominated by the blocking matrix (BM). A common approach for constructing the BM is to use a projection matrix to the null-subspace of the constraints. The latter BM is denoted as the eigen-space BM, and requires M\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n complex multiplications, where M is the number of microphones. In the current contribution, a novel systematic scheme for constructing a multiple constraints sparse BM is presented. The sparsity of the proposed BM substantially reduces the complexity to K \u00d7 (M - K) complex multiplications, where K is the number of constraints. A theoretical analysis of the signal leakage and of the blocking ability of the proposed sparse BM and of the eigen-space BM is derived. It is proven analytically, and tested for narrowband signals and for speech signals, that the blocking abilities of the sparse and of the eigen-space BMs are equivalent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287851/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12966563","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287851/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A sparse blocking matrix for multiple constraints GSC beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sparse blocking matrix for multiple constraints GSC beamformer","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042366S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287853,"authors":[{"name":"Tofigh Naghibi","affiliation":["Speech Processing Group, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tofigh","lastName":"Naghibi","id":"37646174800"},{"name":"Beat Pfister","affiliation":["Speech Processing Group, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Beat","lastName":"Pfister","id":"37417381400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287853","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Microphones","Interference","Transfer functions","Robustness","Arrays","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","estimation theory","interference suppression","microphone arrays","reverberation","transfer function matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamformers","desired signal cancellation","reverberation","microphone transfer function mismatch","steering vector error","voice activity information","beamformer update","speech activity","signal cancellation effect","source-to-microphones transfer functions","data covariance matrix","rough estimates","source locations","estimated target direction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array","signal cancellation effect","weighted Procrustes problem","dereverberation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to prevent adaptive beamformers from cancelling the desired signal","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287853","startPage":"205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287853","abstract":"Under real conditions, severe signal cancellation often occurs in adaptive beamformers because of reverberation, microphone transfer function mismatch or steering vector error.

Although measurement techniques for acquiring and processing spatial information in a room using arrays of loudspeakers and microphones have been recently proposed, the current literature in room acoustics does not describe the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in a comprehensive manner. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to present an initial theoretical framework for the spatial analysis of enclosed sound fields using an acoustic MIMO system, based on a spherical loudspeaker array and a spherical microphone array. The fundamental characteristics of the system transfer matrix are shown to be invariant to rotation of the arrays, with its rank dependant on the number of reflections in the room. The paper concludes with a simulation study validating the theoretical models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287854/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12966565","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287854/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of acoustic MIMO systems in enclosed sound fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of acoustic MIMO systems in enclosed sound fields","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085989S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6287861,"authors":[{"name":"Lars-Johan Br\u00e4nnmark","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences, Signals and Systems, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars-Johan","lastName":"Br\u00e4nnmark","id":"38529009800"},{"name":"Adrian Bahne","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences, Signals and Systems, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bahne","id":"38526563100"},{"name":"Anders Ahl\u00e9n","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences, Signals and Systems, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Ahl\u00e9n","id":"37323684300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287861","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loudspeakers","Polynomials","MIMO","Acoustics","Transfer functions","Robustness","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feedforward","filtering theory","loudspeakers","MIMO systems","sound reproduction","spectral analysis","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple loudspeakers","MIMO feedforward control","multichannel approach","robust loudspeaker-room equalization","room correction problem","single-channel methods","loudspeaker signals","separate scalar filters","spectral flatness","acoustic transfer functions","audio reproduction systems","equalization performance","MIMO formulation","multichannel generalization","single-channel approach","reproduction error","spatial variability","preringing artifacts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic signal processing","audio systems","equalizers","MIMO","polynomials"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new multichannel approach to robust loudspeaker-room equalization is presented. Traditionally, the equalization (or room correction) problem has been treated mostly by single-channel methods, with loudspeaker signals being prefiltered individually by separate scalar filters. Single-channel methods can generally improve the average spectral flatness of the acoustic transfer functions in a listening region, but the variability of the transfer functions within the region cannot be affected. Most modern audio reproduction systems, however, contain two or more loudspeakers, and in this paper we aim at improving the equalization performance by using all available loudspeakers jointly. To this end we propose a general MIMO formulation of the problem, which is a multichannel generalization of an earlier single-channel approach by the authors. The new approach is found to reduce the average reproduction error and the spatial variability of the acoustic transfer functions. Moreover, pre-ringing artifacts are avoided, and the reproduction error below 1000 Hz is significantly reduced with an amount that scales with the number of loudspeakers used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved loudspeaker-room equalization using multiple loudspeakers and MIMO feedforward control","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287861","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287861.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improved loudspeaker-room equalization using multiple loudspeakers and MIMO feedforward control","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287861/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved loudspeaker-room equalization using multiple loudspeakers and MIMO feedforward control","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050064S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6287865,"authors":[{"name":"Jalil Taghia","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jalil","lastName":"Taghia","id":"37705030300"},{"name":"Nasser Mohammadiha","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Mohammadiha","id":"37394550500"},{"name":"Arne Leijon","affiliation":["Sound and Image Processing Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Arne","lastName":"Leijon","id":"37394551100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287865","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Time frequency analysis","Blind source separation","Bayesian methods","Speech","Density functional theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","blind source separation","Gaussian processes","time-frequency analysis","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variational Bayes approach","underdetermined blind source separation","automatic determination","variational treatment","frequency bin-wise manner","time-frequency mixture","variational mixture","circular-symmetric complex-Gaussian density function","Bayesian inference","conjugate prior distribution","learning task","hyper-parameter estimation","variational posterior distribution optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind source separation","variational Bayesian approach","number of sources","variational mixture of Gaussians"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a variational Bayes approach to the underdetermined blind source separation and show how a variational treatment can open up the possibility of determining the actual number of sources.

Unlike factorial HMM, CRF does not have the conditional independence assumption on observations, thus different types of observations from the speech mixture can be integrated into the models through feature functions. Similar to factorial HMM, there is the statistical independence assumption on sources. Under this assumption, the two-source single-microphone speech separation problem can be expressed by two independent linear-chain CRFs. The separation problem becomes two pattern recognition problems, with respect to CRF models of the two sources.

mode control with residual noise estimation for beamformer-based multi-channel speech enhancement","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new adaptation mode controller (AMC) for a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) having prior knowledge of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a desired speech source. In order to optimize the adaptation mode of a GSC, the residual noise remaining in the GSC output must be employed for adapting the AMC. The residual noise in the GSC output is estimated by using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based Wiener filter, where a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a posteriori target-to-non-target-directional signal ratio (TNR) are estimated based on a decision-directed approach and a DOA-based approach, respectively. The estimated residual noise is finally incorporated as a control parameter into the adaptive filters in the AMC. The performance of the proposed AMC is evaluated by measuring the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) scores and cepstral distortion in car noise environments with SNRs from 0 to 20 dB. Experimental results show that the proposed AMC performs better than the conventional AMCs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287876/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12966587","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287876/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation mode control with residual noise estimation for beamformer-based multi-channel speech enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation mode control with residual noise estimation for beamformer-based multi-channel speech enhancement","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056179S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6287915,"authors":[{"name":"Tzu-Chun Yeh","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Chun","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38469757300"},{"name":"Ming-Ju Wu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Ju","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238507100"},{"name":"Jyh-Shing Roger Jang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyh-Shing Roger","lastName":"Jang","id":"37380631600"},{"name":"Wei-Lun Chang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Lun","lastName":"Chang","id":"38469395300"},{"name":"I-Bin Liao","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Bin","lastName":"Liao","id":"37698575300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287915","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Market research","Estimation","Accuracy","Instruments","Indexes","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","hidden Markov models","music","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid approach","singing pitch extraction","trend estimation","hidden Markov model","polyphonic audio music","pitch tracking method","trend-estimation-based method","forward signal","backward signal","training-based HMM method","audio melody extraction","MIREX 2010"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio Melody Extraction","Hidden Markov Model","Trend Estimation","Singing Pitch Extraction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for singing pitch extraction from polyphonic audio music.

Applications of such technology include, but are not limited to, query-by-example search, spoken term detection and automatic word discovery. Obtaining content-aware acoustic features as independent as possible from speaker and acoustic environment variations is a key step in these algorithms. Currently, GMM posteriorgrams are found to outperform the standard MFCC features even though they were not designed to optimize the discrimination between acoustic classes. In this paper we combine the K-means clustering algorithm with the GMM posteriorgrams front-end to obtain more discriminant features. Results on a query-by-example task show that the proposed approaches outperform standard MFCC features by 7.8% absolute P@N and GMM-based posteriorgram features by 3.7% absolute P@N when using a 64-dimensional feature vector.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287922.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker independent discriminant feature extraction for acoustic pattern-matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Vectors","Clustering algorithms","Training","Standards","Data models","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian distribution","pattern clustering","speaker recognition","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker independent discriminant feature extraction","acoustic pattern-matching","automatic processing","speech utterances","query-by-example search","spoken term detection","automatic word discovery","content-aware acoustic features","speaker environment variations","acoustic environment variations","GMM posteriorgrams","standard MFCC features","K-means clustering","GMM-based posteriorgram features","64-dimensional feature vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pattern-matching","word discovery","query-by-example","k-means"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Speaker independent discriminant feature extraction for acoustic pattern-matching","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966633","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker independent discriminant feature extraction for acoustic pattern-matching","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048858S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6287974,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Ito","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37270018600"},{"name":"Hirotoshi Arai","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotoshi","lastName":"Arai","id":"38469689400"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Yamada","affiliation":["Research Division of Intelligence and Information Sciences, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37336767700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6287974","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"abstract":"The application of compressed sensing (CS) to MRI has the potential for significant scan time reductions. The signal obtained in the phase-scrambling Fourier transform (PSFT) imaging technique shows better performances compared to standard Fourier transform base imaging when it is applied to CS. Sparsity of signal is an essential condition for compressed sensing. In this work, we adopt a FREBAS transform as a sparsifying transform function instead of wavelet transform to improve the quality of images in PSFT based CS. It was shown that the directionality of FREBAS transform and the usage of successive thresholding in FREBAS domain offers fairly good images, particularly at low sampling rates. In addition, proposed method is robust to the choice of sampling trajectory of NMR signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06287974.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"680","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6287974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing using FREBAS transform in magnetic resonance phase scrambling Fourier transform technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Trajectory","Compressed sensing","Fourier transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","biomedical NMR","Fourier transforms","image coding","medical image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","FREBAS transform","magnetic resonance phase scrambling","Fourier transform technique","MRI","scan time reductions","PSFT imaging","signal sparsity","sparsifying transform function","wavelet transform","image quality","NMR signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["L1-norm","FREBAS","MRI","sparse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6287974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing using FREBAS transform in magnetic resonance phase scrambling Fourier transform technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6287974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966685","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing using FREBAS transform in magnetic resonance phase scrambling Fourier transform technique","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042625S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6287974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6287976,"authors":[{"name":"Marco F.

In this paper, we propose an initial approach for feature extraction for classification purposes via Hidden Markov Tree models trained on skin sample melanin intensity images.

The method indeed works well when the template and the block to be predicted are highly correlated, e.g., in homogenous image areas, however, it obviously fails in areas with non homogeneous textures. This paper explores the idea of using a block-matching intra prediction algorithm which, thanks to a Rate-Distorsion (RD) based decision mechanism, will naturally be used in image areas when template matching (TM) fails. This new method offers a significant coding gain compared to H.264 Intra prediction modes and the template matching based prediction. Indeed, the TM-based algorithm and the proposed hybrid algorithm lead, with the Bjontergaard measure, to rate gains of up to respectively 38.02% and 48.38% at low bitrates when compared with H.264 Intra only.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288000","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"781","endPage":"784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid template and block matching algorithm for image intra prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid template and block matching algorithm for image intra prediction","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288000/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966710","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288000/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid template and block matching algorithm for image intra prediction","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053874S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6288008,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Shik Kim","affiliation":["Video & Image Processing, Systems and Applications R&D Center, Dallas, TX"],"firstName":"Woo-Shik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086774301"},{"name":"Sunil K.

An image or video signal is represented as a graph signal, where the graph is generated so as not to cross an image edge in a local region, i.e., square block. Then, spectral representation of graph signal is used to form transform kernels by finding eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix of the graph. This method requires to include additional information, i.e., edge map or adjacency matrix, into a bitstream so that a decoder can regenerate the exactly same graph used at an encoder. The novelty of this paper includes finding the optimal adjacency matrix and compressing it using context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding. Coding efficiency improvement can be achieved when an image block contains arbitrarily shaped edges by applying the transform not across the edges. The proposed transform is applied to coding depth maps used for view synthesis in a multi-view video coding system, and provides 14% bit rate savings on average.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288008.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph based transforms for depth video coding","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288008","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Graph based transforms for depth video coding","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966718","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288008/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph based transforms for depth video coding","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0000813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055747S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288026,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ta Chu","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ta","lastName":"Chu","id":"37278390200"},{"name":"Sheng-Chung Tseng","affiliation":["National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Chung","lastName":"Tseng","id":"38469687400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288026","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Feature extraction","Visualization","Instruction sets","Vectors","Vector quantization","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","graphics processing units","information retrieval","multimedia computing","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated scene categorization","multiscale category-specific visual word strategy","computer vision","multimedia information retrieval","bag of word models","Euclidean distance","feature clustering","visual word quantization","GPU implementations","comprehensive experiments","multimedia analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","scene categorization","multiscale category-specific visual words"]}],"abstract":"We utilize GPU to accelerate an essential component for computer vision and multimedia information retrieval, i.e. scene categorization.

In this work, DirLOTs are used to construct directional symmetric orthonormal discrete wavelet transforms and then the bases are adopted to generate a redundant dictionary with several directions. The multiple directional property is suitable for representing natural images which contain diagonal edges and textures. The proposed dictionary is applied to solve the basis pursuit denoising problem. The denoising performance is evaluated for several images through the heuristic shrinkage and block-coordinate-relaxation algorithm.

Experiment results show that, compared to HEVC Test Model (HM) 2.0, our proposal achieves an average of 1.65% bitrate reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288107","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra prediction with enhanced inpainting method and vector predictor for HEVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intra prediction with enhanced inpainting method and vector predictor for HEVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288107/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966816","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288107/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra prediction with enhanced inpainting method and vector predictor for HEVC","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061012S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288110,"authors":[{"name":"Harley Zhang","affiliation":["Research Laboratory of Electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Harley","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469760800"},{"name":"Jae S.

Using direction-adaptive one-dimensional discrete cosine transforms (1D-DCTs) can provide significant additional bitrate savings. However, this requires optimization over all available transforms to minimize the overall bitrate, which can be expensive in terms of time and computation. We examine the use of only the horizontal and vertical 1D-DCTs in addition to the 2D-DCT for coding motion compensation residuals. By reducing the number of available transforms, the amount of required computation decreases significantly, with a potential cost in performance. We perform experiments using a modified H.264/AVC codec to compare the performance of using different sets of available transforms. The results indicate that for typical applications of video coding, most of the performance benefit from using directional 1D-DCTs can be retained by keeping only the horizontal and vertical 1D-DCTs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288110.pdf","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1232","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of one-dimensional transforms in coding motion compensation prediction residuals for video applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Bit rate","Codecs","Video coding","Encoding","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","motion compensation","optimisation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-dimensional transforms","motion compensation prediction residual coding","two-dimensional discrete cosine transform","2D-DCT","direction-adaptive one-dimensional discrete cosine transforms","direction-adaptive 1D-DCT","optimization","horizontal 1D-DCT","vertical 1D-DCT","modified H.264-AVC codec","video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","motion compensation","video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of one-dimensional transforms in coding motion compensation prediction residuals for video applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288110/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966819","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of one-dimensional transforms in coding motion compensation prediction residuals for video applications","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05382S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6288147,"authors":[{"name":"Linbin Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Linbin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086744345"},{"name":"Miao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240473600"},{"name":"Chris Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, TX"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Ding","id":"37284220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288147","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Robustness","Standards","Noise","Image reconstruction","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image denoising","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","optimisation","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L1-norm principal component analysis","L1-norm based PCA","Karhunen-Loeve transform","dimensionality reduction","feature selection","subspace detection","sum of squared error minimization","feature noise","optimization","image occlusions","image denoising"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Principal component analysis","robustness","Lagrangian methods","Image processing"]}],"abstract":"Principal component analysis (PCA) (also called Karhunen - Lo\u00e8ve transform) has been widely used for dimensionality reduction, denoising, feature selection, subspace detection and other purposes.

In addition, we adopt the spatial information to preserve the completeness of the detected motion objects.

In this paper, we propose a novel face representation scheme based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and block-based kernel Fisher linear discriminant (BKFLD). NSCT is a newly developed multiresolution analysis tool and has the ability to extract both intrinsic geometrical structure and directional information in images, which implies its discriminative potential for effective feature extraction of face images. By encoding the the NSCT coefficient images with the local binary pattern (LBP) operator, we could obtain a robust feature set. Furthermore, kernel Fisher linear discriminant is introduced to select the most discriminative feature sets, and the block-based scheme is incorporated to address the small sample size problem. Face recognition experiments on FERET database demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288183","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288183.pdf","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1536","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform and block-based kernel Fisher linear discriminant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform and block-based kernel Fisher linear discriminant","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966890","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288183/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform and block-based kernel Fisher linear discriminant","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043103S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6288184,"authors":[{"name":"Niall McLaughlin","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Niall","lastName":"McLaughlin","id":"38469485100"},{"name":"Ji Ming","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Ming","id":"37275945100"},{"name":"Danny Crookes","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Crookes","id":"37273373000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288184","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"In this paper we demonstrate a simple and novel illumination model that can be used for illumination invariant facial recognition. This model requires no prior knowledge of the illumination conditions and can be used when there is only a single training image per-person. The proposed illumination model separates the effects of illumination over a small area of the face into two components; an additive component modelling the mean illumination and a multiplicative component, modelling the variance within the facial area. Illumination invariant facial recognition is performed in a piecewise manner, by splitting the face image into blocks, then normalizing the illumination within each block based on the new lighting model. The assumptions underlying this novel lighting model have been verified on the YaleB face database. We show that magnitude 2D Fourier features can be used as robust facial descriptors within the new lighting model. Using only a single training image per-person, our new method achieves high (in most cases 100%) identification accuracy on the YaleB, extended YaleB and CMU-PIE face databases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Accuracy","Face","Databases","Face recognition","Training","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination invariant facial recognition","piecewise-constant lighting model","illumination conditions","illumination model","additive component modelling","mean illumination","multiplicative component","facial area","face image","YaleB face database","magnitude 2D Fourier features","robust facial descriptors","CMU-PIE face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["facial recognition","illumination invariance","lighting model","limited training data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288184","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288184.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination invariant facial recognition using a piecewise-constant lighting model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Illumination invariant facial recognition using a piecewise-constant lighting model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288184/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288184/","accessionNumber":"12966891","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination invariant facial recognition using a piecewise-constant lighting model","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05308S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288188,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068212200"},{"name":"Jiayi Du","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Du","id":"37086801219"},{"name":"Jingtong Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jingtong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37309334200"},{"name":"Qingfeng Zhuge","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Zhuge","id":"37266661400"},{"name":"Edwin H.-M.

It is desirable to apply NVM as main memory in embedded Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) systems. However, NVMs have drawbacks that need to be overcome. That is, a write to the NVMs is expensive. Loops are the most critical and time-consuming part in digital signal processing (DSP) applications. However, loops are difficult to parallelize on multi-processor systems due to the inter-iteration dependencies. This paper targets on embedded CMP systems and proposes techniques to improve loop parallelism while considering reducing the write activities to the NVMs when they are used as main memory. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of write activities on NVM by 21.1% on average. In other words, the average lifetime of NVM can be extended to at least 2 times longer than before and the total schedule length is reduced by 19.6% on average.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288188","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288188.pdf","startPage":"1553","endPage":"1556","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop scheduling optimization for chip-multiprocessors with non-volatile main memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Loop scheduling optimization for chip-multiprocessors with non-volatile main memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12966895","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288188/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop scheduling optimization for chip-multiprocessors with non-volatile main memory","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058409S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6288191,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085469875"},{"name":"Yun Pan","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37401475000"},{"name":"Xiaolang Yan","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolang","lastName":"Yan","id":"37275973800"},{"name":"Ruohong Huan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ruohong","lastName":"Huan","id":"37670805400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288191","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle filters","RNA","Memory management","Scalability","Indexes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering (numerical methods)","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical resampling architecture","distributed particle filter","processing element","unitary resampling","intermediate resampling procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Architecture","distributed particle filters","hierarchical resampling","latency","high memory efficiency"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hierarchical resampling (HR) architecture has been presented for distributed particle filters (PFs).

These consume a significant amount of chip resources; we aim to reduce costs by improving the system's accuracy per chip-area. For OFDM signals, we characterize the growth of data within the FFT and explore several cost-conscious methods for improving the fixed-point format. Using ASIC synthesis and hardware accurate simulations, we evaluate the corresponding system error and stability of these methods. We introduce Directive Scaling, which provides an average increase in overall accuracy without additional runtime-adaptive mechanisms. ASIC synthesis results show minimal overhead, and we explicitly evaluate and explain the inherent tradeoffs. When applied to an 8-bit IFFT design, our technique improves precision by approximately two bits with just a 4% area overhead, as opposed to the additional 32% area overhead required using standard methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving fixed-point accuracy of FFT cores in O-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288196","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288196.pdf","startPage":"1585","endPage":"1588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improving fixed-point accuracy of FFT cores in O-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288196/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966903","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving fixed-point accuracy of FFT cores in O-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08753S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288198,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tawfiq","affiliation":["Edward S.

The main goal of this paper is to present an augmentation protocol for the physical layer of the IEEE 802.15.6 specifications with focus on the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) mitigation in a proactive WBAN. The proposed methodology uses a new set of orthogonal codes from the conventional Walsh-Hadamard matrix which has the special property of \u201ccyclic orthogonality\u201d. This property ensures that the asynchronous nature of the WBAN does not produce MAI amongst the multiple on-body sensors. The work investigates the optimality of such codes in WBANs from the link Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. We show that the proposed spreading codes outperform conventional non-cyclic orthogonal spreading codes in a practical Rayleigh fading environment.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288198","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic orthogonal codes in CDMA-based asynchronous Wireless Body Area Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic orthogonal codes in CDMA-based asynchronous Wireless Body Area Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288198/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966905","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288198/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic orthogonal codes in CDMA-based asynchronous Wireless Body Area Networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053403S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288199,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Jerbi","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Sfax, Sfax, TN"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Jerbi","id":"38192786800"},{"name":"Micka\u00ebl Raulet","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, IETR/INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Micka\u00ebl","lastName":"Raulet","id":"37395391500"},{"name":"Olivier D\u00e9forges","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, IETR/INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"D\u00e9forges","id":"37328515600"},{"name":"Mohamed Abid","affiliation":["CES Laboratory, National Engineering school of Sfax, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abid","id":"37299902600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288199","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Video coding","Hardware design languages","Complexity theory","MPEG 4 Standard","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hardware description languages","program compilers","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level RVC-cal description","automatic generation","synthesizable hardware implementation","image coding","video coding","directly hardware description languages","VHDL","Verilog","high level language","target-independent language","Caltrop Actor Language","dataflow applications","hardware compiler","CAL hardware back-end","feature detection","target features","reconfigurable video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RVC-CAL","Data flow computing","CAL compiler","Automatic transformation"]}],"abstract":"Data process algorithms are increasing in complexity especially for image and video coding. Therefore, hardware development using directly hardware description languages (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog is a difficult task. Current research axes in this context are introducing new methodologies to automate the generation of such descriptions. In our work we adopted a high level and target-independent language called CAL (Caltrop Actor Language). This language is associated with a set of tools to easily design dataflow applications and also a hardware compiler to automatically generate the implementation. Before the modifications presented in this paper, the existing CAL hardware back-end did not support some high-level features of the CAL language. Consequently, high-level designed actors had to be manually transformed to be synthesizable. In this paper, we introduce a general automatic transformation of CAL descriptions to make these structures compliant and synthesizable. This transformation analyses the CAL code, detects the target features and makes the required changes to obtain synthesizable code while keeping the same application behavior. This work resolves the main bottleneck of the hardware generation flow from CAL designs.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288199","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic generation of synthesizable hardware implementation from high level RVC-cal description","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic generation of synthesizable hardware implementation from high level RVC-cal description","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288199/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966906","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic generation of synthesizable hardware implementation from high level RVC-cal description","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049872S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288200,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-hwan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280604200"},{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wonyong","lastName":"Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288200","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":335},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288200","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Indexes","Channel models","Out of order","Interference","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","error statistics","flash memories","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","NAND circuits","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least square based cell-to-cell interference cancellation technique","multilevel cell nand flash memory","semiconductor technology","signal processing approach","interference mitigation","LMS adaptive filtering based method","least mean square adaptive filtering based method","simulation model","channel characteristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell-to-cell interference","NAND flash memory","least squares","LMS adaptive filter"]}],"abstract":"Cell-to-cell interference becomes a major source of bit errors in NAND flash memories as the semiconductor technology continuously shrinks down. Recently, signal processing approaches to mitigate the interference have been proposed, and the least mean square (LMS) adaptive filtering based method [1] offers a promising solution. In this research, we propose a least squares based cell-to-cell interference cancelation method, which is more suitable for NAND flash memory devices where one page of data is accessed at a time. With a simulation model, we show that this approach outperforms the LMS filtering based one whether the interference is severe or not. In order to simplify the algorithm, the input data to compute the channel characteristics is decimated, and as a result the arithmetic intensity of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the LMS based one.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288200","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288200.pdf","startPage":"1601","endPage":"1604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least squares based cell-to-cell interference cancelation technique for multi-level cell nand flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Least squares based cell-to-cell interference cancelation technique for multi-level cell nand flash memory","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288200/","accessionNumber":"12966907","publicationDate":"March 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least squares based cell-to-cell interference cancelation technique for multi-level cell nand flash memory","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066875S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6288201,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Ching Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Ching","lastName":"Chu","id":"38469382300"},{"name":"Yi-Min Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Min","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405324600"},{"name":"Chi-Heng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Heng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37898170900"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsie-Chia","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280773500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288201","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":475},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Decoding","Calculators","Ash","Codecs","Error correction codes","Parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","CMOS memory circuits","codecs","error correction codes","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","NOR circuits","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully parallel BCH codec","double error correction","NOR flash application","NOR flash memory","latency constraint","error location polynomial","constant finite filed multiplier","CMOS technology","size 90 nm"]}],"abstract":"A double error correcting (DEC) BCH codec is designed for NOR flash memory systems to improve reliability.

We show that by careful selection of the BSS algorithm the double-talk (DT) problem in AEC is solved without the need to use a DT detector or a step-size controller. Furthermore, the echo cancellation performance is maintained even during single-talk when only the far-end speaker is active. The algorithm converges to the true echo path much faster than the normalized least-mean squares adaptation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not require a knowledge of the echo-tail length and is robust against under estimation of the echo-filter length. The simple implementation and fast convergence of the proposed method makes it a suitable candidate for implementation on low-power general purpose DSPs.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288225","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"1701","endPage":"1704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation and acoustic echo cancellation: A unified framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation and acoustic echo cancellation: A unified framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288225/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966932","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation and acoustic echo cancellation: A unified framework","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045053S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288230,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Du","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Du","id":"37649186400"},{"name":"Qiang Huo","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Huo","id":"37067063200"},{"name":"Kai Chen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"38469742900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288230","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Training","Handwriting recognition","Accuracy","Prototypes","Vocabulary","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","handwritten character recognition","image classification","image coding","image recognition","optimisation","trees (mathematics)","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large vocabulary online handwritten Chinese characters","compact multiple-prototype based classifier design","Rprop algorithms","sample-separation-margin","minimum classification error objective function","split vector quantization technique","classifier parameter compression","fast-match tree","online handwritten character recognition task","rotation-free recognition preprocessing technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["handwritten Chinese character recognition","rotation-free","Rprop","MCE"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288230","abstract":"We present a study of designing compact multiple-prototype based classifiers for rotation-free recognition of online handwritten Chinese characters.

Though many of these techniques can reliably detect traditional forgeries, recent research has shown that they can easily be fooled by anti-forensic operations designed to hide evidence of forgery. In response, new forensic techniques have been developed to detect the use of anti-forensics. In light of this, there is now a need to develop a theoretical understanding of the interactions between a forger using anti-forensics and a forensic investigator. In this paper, we propose techniques to evaluate the performance of anti-forensic algorithms along with a game theoretic framework for analyzing the interplay between forensics and anti-forensics. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic video frame deletion detection technique along with a technique to detect the use of video anti-forensics. We evaluate these techniques using our proposed analytical framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1752","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288237.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288237","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forensics","Forgery","Vectors","Nash equilibrium","Multimedia communication","Detectors","Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer forensics","decision theory","game theory","multimedia computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theoretic framework","game theoretic framework","digital forgeries","digital multimedia files","automatic video frame deletion detection","video anti-forensics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-Forensics","Digital Forensics","Video Compression","Game Theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forensics vs. anti-forensics: A decision and game theoretic framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966944","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288237/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288237/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forensics vs. anti-forensics: A decision and game theoretic framework","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039707S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":6288260,"authors":[{"name":"Xunyu Pan","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xunyu","lastName":"Pan","id":"37986251600"},{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38247990300"},{"name":"Siwei Lyu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Siwei","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37430715900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288260","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise level","Noise","Estimation","Splicing","Forgery","Discrete cosine transforms","Forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","audio watermarking","band-pass filters","computer forensics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local noise level estimation","digital audio signal tampering","splicing detection method","bandpass filtering","audio splicing forgeries","digital forensics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital Forensics","Audio Splicing","Local Noise Level Estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288260","abstract":"One common form of tampering in digital audio signals is known as splicing, where sections from one audio is inserted to another audio.

Existing research has mainly investigated the problem of localization in static WSNs, where the localization is performed mainly at the time of the node deployment. In contrast, it is important to keep track of the current locations of the nodes by invoking the localization algorithm periodically in mobile nodes. The high computation cost associated with most existing localization algorithms makes them less practical to use in resource constrained mobile sensor networks (MSNs). Additionally, these existing techniques often fail in hostile environments where some of the nodes may be compromised by adversaries, and used to transmit misleading information aimed at preventing accurate localization of the remaining sensors. In this paper, we build on our earlier work to propose an iterative gradient descent based technique with low computational complexity to securely localize nodes in MSNs. The proposed algorithm combines iterative gradient descent with selective pruning of inconsistent measurements to achieve a high localization accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can find a map of relative locations of the MSN even when some nodes are compromised and transmit false information.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288267","startPage":"1869","endPage":"1872","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288267.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A gradient descent based approach to secure localization in mobile sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Wireless sensor networks","Accuracy","Robot sensing systems","Ad hoc networks","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","iterative methods","mobile radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient descent based approach","localization","mobile sensor networks","wireless sensor networks","current locations","computation cost","iterative gradient descent","computational complexity","transmit false information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Sensor Networks","Secure Localization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"A gradient descent based approach to secure localization in mobile sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288267/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966974","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A gradient descent based approach to secure localization in mobile sensor networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061701S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288268,"authors":[{"name":"Hung X Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Hung X","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37278174000"},{"name":"Matthew Roughan","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Roughan","id":"37325973800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288268","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Markov processes","Observers","Protocols","Privacy","Vectors","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","data privacy","hidden Markov models","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobserver hidden Markov model identifiability","Internet service provider","ISP","multiparty secure distributed computation","data privacy","network attack detection","HMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Models","Multiple Observers","Identifiability","Security","Networks"]}],"abstract":"Most large attacks on the Internet are distributed.

Construction of methods that enable each row or column to be individually optimized, i.e., decoupled, are desirable for a number of reasons. With proper decoupling, the convergence characteristics such as local stability can be improved. Decoupling can enable density matching in applications such as independent component analysis (ICA). Lastly, efficient Newton algorithms become tractable after decoupling. The most common method for decoupling rows is to reduce the optimization space to orthogonal matrices. Such restrictions can degrade performance. We present a decoupling procedure that uses standard vector optimization procedures while still admitting nonorthogonal solutions. We utilize the decoupling procedure to develop a new decoupled ICA algorithm that uses Newton optimization enabling superior performance when the sample size is limited.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective decoupling method for matrix optimization and its application to the ICA problem","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288271","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288271.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"An effective decoupling method for matrix optimization and its application to the ICA problem","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288271/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966978","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective decoupling method for matrix optimization and its application to the ICA problem","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047795S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288286,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Ming Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Ming","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536724400"},{"name":"Jar-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jar-Ferr","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280193800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288286","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel linear regression for low resolution face recognition under variable illumination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Kernel","Face recognition","Vectors","Linear regression","Face","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image reconstruction","image resolution","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low resolution face recognition","variable illumination","kernel linear regression classification","nonlinear mapping function","nonlinear data distribution","kernel trick","kernel projection","minimum reconstruction error","Yale B facial database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kernel Linear Regression","Low Resolution Face Recognition","Illumination Variation"]}],"abstract":"To improve the limitation of linear regression classification, a class specific kernel linear regression classification is proposed for low resolution face recognition under variable illumination.

Our method involves training a connectionist network that simultaneously learns a distributed latent representation of the words, while maximizing the tagging accuracy. To compensate for the unavailability of true labels, we resort to training the model using a Curriculum: instead of random order, the model is trained using an ordered sequence of training samples, proceeding from \u201ceasier\u201d to \u201charder\u201d samples. On a standard test corpus, we show that without using any grammatical information, our model is able to outperform the standard EM algorithm in tagging accuracy, and its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art models. We also show that curriculum learning for this setting significantly improves performance, both in terms of speed of convergence and in terms of generalization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weakly supervised neural networks for Part-Of-Speech tagging","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288291","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288291.pdf","startPage":"1965","endPage":"1968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Weakly supervised neural networks for Part-Of-Speech tagging","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288291/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966998","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weakly supervised neural networks for Part-Of-Speech tagging","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0001965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06248S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6288301,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mediamatics, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38263062500"},{"name":"Richard Heusdens","affiliation":["Department of Mediamatics, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Heusdens","id":"37284710400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288301","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Linear systems","Equations","Inference algorithms","Belief propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear coordinate-descent message-passing","quadratic optimization","updating messages","linear functions","min-sum algorithm","quadratic functions","linear coordinate-descent algorithm","quadratic matrix","walk-summable","general linear systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed optimization","message passing","walk summable","coordinate decent"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288301","abstract":"In this paper we propose a new message-passing algorithm for quadratic optimization.

Subsequent efforts have established that the reconstruction performance of CS can be improved by employing additional prior signal knowledge, such as dependency in the location of the non-zero signal coefficients (structured sparsity) or by collecting measurements sequentially and adaptively, in order to focus measurements into the proper subspace where the unknown signal resides. In this paper, we examine a powerful hybrid of adaptivity and structure. We identify a particular form of structured sparsity that is amenable to adaptive sensing, and using concepts from sparse hierarchical dictionary learning we demonstrate that sparsifying dictionaries exhibiting the appropriate form of structured sparsity can be learned from a collection of training data. The combination of these techniques (structured dictionary learning and adaptive sensing) results in an effective and efficient adaptive compressive acquisition approach which we refer to as LASeR (Learning Adaptive Sensing Representations).","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288324","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288324.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning sparse representations for adaptive compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288324/","displayDocTitle":"Learning sparse representations for adaptive compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967031","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288324/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning sparse representations for adaptive compressive sensing","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050706S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288328,"authors":[{"name":"Mathieu Radenen","affiliation":["LIP6, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Radenen","id":"38469596200"},{"name":"Thierry Arti\u00e8res","affiliation":["LIP6, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Arti\u00e8res","id":"37270927800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288328","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Covariance matrix","Context","Vectors","Training","Speech recognition","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","handwriting recognition","hidden Markov models","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contextual hidden Markov model","HMM","handling variability","probability distribution","speech recognition","emotion feature","gesture recognition","handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Model","Handwriting Recognition","Context variables"]}],"abstract":"Multiple works have proposed extensions of HMMs for handling variability.

The DSN provides a method of stacking simple processing modules in buiding deep architectures, with a convex learning problem in each module. Additional fine tuning further improves the DSN, while introducing minor non-convexity. Full learning in the DSN is batch-mode, making it amenable to parallel training over many machines and thus be scalable over the potentially huge size of the training data.

Previous approaches address dependent samples by downsampling the dataset so that existing order detection methods can be used. By downsampling the data, the sample size is decreased so that the accuracy of the order estimation is degraded. In this paper, we introduce two linear mixture models with dependent samples. The likelihood for each model is developed based on the entire data set and used in an information theoretic framework to improve the order estimation performance for dependent samples.

The DDT captures long and short-ranged correlations between neighboring regions in each image using a tree-structured prior. Unlike other previous work, DDT first segments an input image into superpixels and learn a tree-structured prior based on the topology of superpixels in different scales. Such a tree structure is referred to as data-driven tree structure. Each superpixel is represented by a variable node taking a discrete value of class/label of the segmentation. The probabilistic relationships among the nodes are represented by edges in the network. The unsupervised image segmentation, hence, can be viewed as an inference problem of the nodes in the tree structure of DDT, which can be carried out efficiently. We evaluate quantitatively our results with respect to the ground-truth segmentation, demonstrating that our proposed framework performs competitively with the state of the art in unsupervised image segmentation and contour detection.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288353","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288353.pdf","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2216","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven tree-structured Bayesian network for image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven tree-structured Bayesian network for image segmentation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967058","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288353/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven tree-structured Bayesian network for image segmentation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082463S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288362,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Milani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Milani","id":"37316456000"},{"name":"Marco Tagliasacchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Tagliasacchi","id":"37295473900"},{"name":"Stefano Tubaro","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tubaro","id":"37273801800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288362","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Transform coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Quantization","Support vector machines","Robustness","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer forensics","data compression","image coding","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["JPEG compression","first digit features","double-compressed images","multimedia forensics community","source device identification","photo sharing Web sites","compression stages","forensic method","DCT coefficients","Benford's law","support vector machine classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple JPEG compression","forgery identification","first digit features","Benford's law"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288362","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288362.pdf","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating multiple JPEG compression using first digit features","abstract":"The analysis of double-compressed images is a problem largely studied by the multimedia forensics community, as it might be exploited, e.g., for tampering localization or source device identification. In many practical scenarios, e.g. photos uploaded on blogs, on-line albums, and photo sharing Web sites, images might be compressed several times. However, the identification of the number of compression stages applied to an image remains an open issue. This paper proposes a forensic method based on the analysis of the distribution of the first significant digits of DCT coefficients, which is modeled according to Benford's law. The method relies on a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and allows us to accurately identify the number of compression stages applied to an image. Up to four consecutive compression stages were considered in the experimental validation. The proposed approach extends and outperforms the previously published methods aimed at detecting double JPEG compression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288362/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967067","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Discriminating multiple JPEG compression using first digit features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminating multiple JPEG compression using first digit features","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040389S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288363,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Therefore, it is customary to have the content encoded multiple times. In this paper we consider a processing chain of two coding steps and we propose a method that aims at identifying the type of codec used in the first step, by analyzing its coding-based footprints. The method relies on the fact that lossy coding is an almost idempotent operation, i.e., re-encoding the reconstructed sequence with the same codec and coding parameters produces a sequence that is highly correlated with the input one. As a consequence, it is possible to analyze this sort of correlation to identify the first codec provided that the second codec does not introduce severe quality degradation. The proposed solution finds several applications in the field of multi-media forensics, e.g. to identify the device that generated the original video stream or detect collages of different sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288363/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967068","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Video codec identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video codec identification","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050718S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288385,"authors":[{"name":"Megumi Endoh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Megumi","lastName":"Endoh","id":"38469743500"},{"name":"Tomohiro Yanagimachi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Yanagimachi","id":"38469505200"},{"name":"Ryutarou Ohbuchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryutarou","lastName":"Ohbuchi","id":"37282411600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288385","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Training","Manifolds","Feature extraction","Databases","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","multimedia systems","solid modelling","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manifold learning","3D model retrieval","clustering-based training sample reduction","content-based multimedia retrieval","distance metric","locally linear embedding","feature dimensionality","randomized clustering tree","k-means algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content-based 3D model retrieval","distance metric learning","manifold learning","randomized tree clustering"]}],"abstract":"Retrieval accuracy in content-based multimedia retrieval can be improved by using distance metric learned from distribution of features in input feature space. One way to achieve this is by dimension reduction via manifold-learning, such as Locally Linear Embedding [8]. While effective in improving retrieval accuracy, these algorithms have high computational cost that depends on feature dimensionality d and number of training samples N. In this paper, we explore a clustering-based approach to reduce number of training samples; it uses L cluster centers (L\u226aN) computed from N input features as training samples. We propose to use extremely randomized clustering tree [3] for clustering. Experiments showed that the proposed approach produces better retrieval performance than random sampling, and that the randomized tree is much faster than the k-means algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288385","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288385.pdf","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2348","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient manifold learning for 3D model retrieval by using clustering-based training sample reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Efficient manifold learning for 3D model retrieval by using clustering-based training sample reduction","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967090","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288385/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient manifold learning for 3D model retrieval by using clustering-based training sample reduction","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042851S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288405,"authors":[{"name":"Afsaneh Asaei","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland","Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Afsaneh","lastName":"Asaei","id":"37712099800"},{"name":"Michael E.

The signals can be designed using a two-step method which first optimizes the covariance matrix and then searches for the signals accordingly. A more efficient way is to synthesize transmitted signals by designing a weight matrix given a set of orthogonal waveforms, which makes use of both MIMO waveform diversity and phased-array transmit gain. In this paper, we propose a method to design the transmit beampattern by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Then the eigen-decomposition of the optimal covariance matrix yields the weight matrix. Therefore it is called the SDP-EIG method. As a result, the overall transmitted waveforms are obtained more simply and efficiently, and the number of orthogonal signals required to form a desired beam reaches its minimum.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288412.pdf","startPage":"2453","endPage":"2456","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Colocated MIMO radar transmit beamforming using orthogonal waveforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Covariance matrix","Radar antennas","MIMO","Optimization","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","mathematical programming","MIMO radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colocated MIMO radar transmit beamforming","orthogonal waveforms","multiple-input-multiple-output radar transmit beamforming","two-step method","weight matrix","MIMO waveform diversity","phased-array transmit gain","semidefinite programming problem","optimal covariance matrix","SDP-EIG method","orthogonal signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Radar","transmit beamforming","transmit energy focusing","transmitted signal synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Colocated MIMO radar transmit beamforming using orthogonal waveforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967117","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Colocated MIMO radar transmit beamforming using orthogonal waveforms","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059343S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288414,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The majority of the literature prefers to omit the effect of propagation attenuation, and considers the receiving gain vectors to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) in power allocation. In this paper, we integrate the propagation losses into MIMO radar signal model, and investigate the power allocation problems under three popular criteria: maximizing the mutual information, minimizing the minimum mean square errors, and maximizing the echo energy. As their objective functions are either convex or concave, the optimal strategies are theoretically guaranteed.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288415","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"2465","endPage":"2468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO radars with heterogeneous propagation losses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO radars with heterogeneous propagation losses","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288415/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967120","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO radars with heterogeneous propagation losses","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044338S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6288416,"authors":[{"name":"Changchang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Changchang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38107624500"},{"name":"Jin Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Yan","id":"38469589400"},{"name":"Weidong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291853500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288416","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":278},"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is expected to achieve good inversion performance by utilizing space diversity technology.

As a key illustrative example, we consider a 4 \u00d7 4 system employing a unitary matrix waveform set, e.g., formed from Golay complementary sequences. When a non-negligible Doppler shift is induced by the target motion, the waveform matrix formed from the complementary sequences is no longer unitary, resulting in significantly degraded target range estimates. To solve this problem, we adopt a subspace based approach exploiting the observation that the receive matrix formed from matched filtering of the reflected waveforms has a (non-trivial) null-space. Through processing of the waveforms with the appropriate vector from the null-space, we can significantly improve the range detection performance. Also, another very important target aspect is the velocity with which the target is moving, and to determine that, the exact Doppler phase shift induced by the target motion needs to be estimated with reasonable accuracy. To accomplish this task, we develop a strategy that uses the MUSIC algorithm to estimate the Doppler phase, and we use simulations to show that the phase estimates obtained are reasonably accurate even at low SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288417","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288417.pdf","startPage":"2473","endPage":"2476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to Doppler compensation and estimation for multiple targets in MIMO radar with unitary waveform matrix scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288417/","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to Doppler compensation and estimation for multiple targets in MIMO radar with unitary waveform matrix scheduling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967122","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288417/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to Doppler compensation and estimation for multiple targets in MIMO radar with unitary waveform matrix scheduling","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048444S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288418,"authors":[{"name":"Jianshu Zhang","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Jianshu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37717251700"},{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"},{"name":"Arash Khabbazibasmenj","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Khabbazibasmenj","id":"37400208100"},{"name":"Sergiy A.

The source does not have direct line-of-sight to the service area and the information is delivered through a relay. The objective of this paper is to jointly optimize the relay position as well as the power allocation between the source and relay so that the outage probability of the signal received at the user nodes is minimized. Two different optimization criteria, which respectively minimize the worst-case outage probability and the average outage probability, are used. The analyses are verified by simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288422.pdf","startPage":"2493","endPage":"2496","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint optimization of relay position and power allocation in cooperative broadcast wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optimization","Resource management","Receivers","Joints","Simulation","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","cooperative communication","optimisation","probability","radio networks","radio receivers","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative broadcast wireless network","resource optimization problem","broadcast relay network","source broadcast","user receiver","service region","relay position","power allocation","signal","user node","optimization criteria","worst-case outage probability","cooperative communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","broadcast network","joint optimization","resource allocation","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimization of relay position and power allocation in cooperative broadcast wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288422/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967126","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimization of relay position and power allocation in cooperative broadcast wireless networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073234S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288427,"authors":[{"name":"Zengli Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology (formerly University of Missouri-Rolla), Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Zengli","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716169300"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology (formerly University of Missouri-Rolla), Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085385919"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"abstract":"This paper successfully implements compressed sensing (CS) to a near-field wideband 3-D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging system.

By introducing flexibility into the survey of the AUV, various limitations of pre-planned surveys are overcome. Experimental results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach in terms of higher area coverage in shorter mission times. The signal processing required by the algorithm is fast and computationally efficient such that real-time implementation is feasible.

The maximum number of detectable directions by the proposed method is twice that by the MUSIC method.

Widely linear minimum variance distortionless response (WL MVDR) beamformers can exploit the noncircularity of received signals and improve the performance of the conventional MVDR beamformer. However, in the optimum WL MVDR beamformer, the array steering vector (ASV) and the signal noncircularity coefficient should be known a priori for the signal of interest. This requirement puts strict limitation to the implementation of this beamformer. We therefore in this paper propose a robust approach to the optimal WL MVDR beamformer that can deal with the uncertainties in the ASV and noncircularity coefficient.

By doing so, the requirement on the exact information is relaxed while the performance improvement can still be obtained.

Also, asymptotic results show that when the number of sensors is very large and the variance of the distance between the sensor nodes and FC is small, multiple antennas do not provide a benefit compared with a single antenna system; when the number of antennas M is large and the measurement noise at the sensor nodes is small compared with the additive noise at the FC, the estimation error variance can be reduced by a factor of M.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288460","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288460.pdf","startPage":"2645","endPage":"2648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-only analog encoding for a multi-antenna fusion center","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288460/","displayDocTitle":"Phase-only analog encoding for a multi-antenna fusion center","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967164","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288460/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-only analog encoding for a multi-antenna fusion center","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042377S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288472,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Vahidnia","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Vahidnia","id":"38469779000"},{"name":"Shahram ShahbazPanahi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"ShahbazPanahi","id":"37273468400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288472","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous bidirectional relay-assisted communications","signal path","propagation delay","relaying paths","inter-symbol-interference","transceivers","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","tackle ISI","amplify-and-forward relaying technique","max-min fair design approach","beamformer weights","transmit power budget"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay networks","cooperative communication","SNR balancing","distributed beamforming","power allocation","Asynchronous relaying"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288472","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288472","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"In this paper, an asynchronous bidirectional relay network is considered. We assume that the signal path going through each relay has a propagation delay which is different from those of the other relaying paths. Such an assumption leads to inter-symbol-interference (ISI) at the two transceivers. As such, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed at the two transceivers to tackle ISI, while the relays, for the sake of simplicity, use amplify-and-forward relaying technique. Using a max-min fair design approach, an SNR balancing technique is presented to jointly obtain the beamformer weights and transceivers' subcarrier power loading under a total transmit power budget.

Specifically, under the assumption that the number of targets is generally much smaller than the number of antennas, the received signals can form a low-rank matrix with noise. According to the recently proposed matrix completion theory, only a subset of the entries are enough to recover the whole matrix as long as certain conditions are met, thus the implementation cost of obtaining a matrix could be reduced. We prove that the matrix formed by the received signals satisfies the condition for matrix recovery. Moreover, a uniform spatial sampling (USS) method is proposed, which is easy for hardware implementation and also could take advantage of the available number of front-end elements to achieve a better performance. We analytically prove that the probability of matrix recovery failure under the USS model is asymptotically equal to that under the Bernoulli model. Simulation results demonstrate that the matrix recovery performance under the USS model is very close to that using the uniform model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288473.pdf","startPage":"2697","endPage":"2700","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-rank matrix completion for array signal processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Analytical models","Manganese","Hardware","Vectors","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","matrix algebra","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-rank matrix completion","array signal processing","uniform spatial sampling method","matrix recovery failure probability","Bernoulli model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix completion","Array signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Low-rank matrix completion for array signal processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967176","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-rank matrix completion for array signal processing","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051814S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288474,"authors":[{"name":"Guosong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Guosong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538439200"},{"name":"Bo Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Peng","id":"38469531400"},{"name":"Hefeng Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Hefeng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37540152000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288474","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Matching pursuit algorithms","Sonar equipment","Underwater acoustics","Diversity reception","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","multipath channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse channel estimation assessment","passive-phase conjugation communications","PPC communications","time delayed arrivals","underwater communications","multipath channels","matching pursuit processing","MP processing","dependent acoustic channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive-phase conjugation","match pursuit","underwater acoustic communication","decision feedback equalizer","sparse channel"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates sparse channel estimations to improve the performance of passive-phase conjugation (PPC) communications.

The CS problem subject to perturbation in the sensing matrix is often encountered in practice and has attracted interest of researches. Unlike existing robust signal recoveries with the recovery error growing linearly with the perturbation level, this paper analyzes the CS problem subject to a structured perturbation to provide conditions for stable signal recovery under measurement noise. Under mild conditions on the perturbed sensing matrix, similar to that for the standard CS, it is shown that a sparse signal can be stably recovered by \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n minimization. A remarkable result is that the recovery is exact and independent of the perturbation if there is no measurement noise and the signal is sufficiently sparse. In the presence of noise, largest entries (in magnitude) of a compressible signal can be stably recovered.

In addition to introducing this scheme for teaching of DSP, some useful examples based on Delta Sigma Modulators are also presented. These modulators are selected because they are an integral part of modern Analog to Digital Converters and encompass many important Signal Processing concepts.

In this paper, we propose a rank-2 transmit beamformed Alamouti space-time code scheme, which may be seen as a generalization of the previous SDR-based beamforming framework. The beamforming problem arising from the proposed scheme is a rank-2 constrained semidefinite program (SDP).We deal with it using the SDR technique, but this time using rank-2 approximation rather than rank-1 approximation in the previous transmit beamforming. An analysis on the worst-case approximation accuracy of the rank-2 SDR approximation is provided, which reveals that the approximation accuracy degrades at a rate of \u221aM, where M is the number of users served. This improves upon the case of transmit beamforming, where the worst-case approximation accuracy degrades at the higher rate of M. Simulation results further show that the proposed scheme performs better than the transmit beamforming scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288497","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288497.pdf","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank-two transmit beamformed Alamouti space-time coding for physical-layer multicasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288497/","displayDocTitle":"Rank-two transmit beamformed Alamouti space-time coding for physical-layer multicasting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288497/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-two transmit beamformed Alamouti space-time coding for physical-layer multicasting","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067914S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6288498,"authors":[{"name":"Sagnik Ghosh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sagnik","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37981062900"},{"name":"Bhaskar D.

The convexity of the robust beamforming problem remains unknown. A slightly conservative version of the robust beamforming problem is thus studied herein as a compromise. It is in the form of a semi-infinite second-order cone program (SOCP), and more importantly, it possesses an equivalent and explicit convex reformulation, due to an linear matrix inequality description of the cone of Lorentz-positive maps. Hence the robust beamforming problem can be efficiently solved by an optimization solver. The simulation results show that the conservativeness of the robust form of semi-infinite SOCP is appropriate in terms of problem feasibility rate and the average transmission power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12967202","htmlLink":"/document/6288499/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Lorentz-positive mapswith applications to robust MISO downlink beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lorentz-positive mapswith applications to robust MISO downlink beamforming","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068331S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288500,"authors":[{"name":"Mirsad \u010cirki\u0107","affiliation":["Communication Systems Division, Department of Electrical Engineering (lSY), Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mirsad","lastName":"\u010cirki\u0107","id":"38229469600"},{"name":"Erik G.

In a dynamic network, it is imperative that the presence of a passive eavesdropper be determined before the transmitter can deploy robust secrecy-encoding schemes as a countermeasure. This is a difficult task in general, since by definition the eavesdropper is passive and never transmits. In this work we adopt a method that allows the legitimate nodes to detect the passive eavesdropper from the local oscillator power that is inadvertently leaked from its RF front end.

A weighted sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to optimize the subcarrier assignment as well as the power loading per CR user, while protecting the primary user (PU) systems. Since the CR-to-PU channels may not be accurately acquired, the PU interference constraint is cast as a chance constraint. Consequently, a convex conservative approximation of the chance constraint is employed for tractability reasons. In particular, to mitigate the combinatorial complexity incurred for optimal subcarrier assignment, a separable structure is pursued, and the dual decomposition method is employed to obtain a near-optimal solver.

The simulation results show that the algorithm improves the sum rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288504","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal joint base station assignment and downlink beamforming for heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal joint base station assignment and downlink beamforming for heterogeneous networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288504/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967207","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288504/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal joint base station assignment and downlink beamforming for heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.259032S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288506,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d3.

For flat-fading channels and feasible problems, this algorithm successfully aligns the interfering signals exploiting the spatial dimensions. In this paper, we consider the case in which all pairwise MIMO channels are frequency-selective (convolutive), and the users transmit broadband signals using a single-carrier scheme. Unlike the flat-fading case, for frequency-selective channels it is necessary to add a spectral mask in the frequency response of the precoders and decoders to avoid trivial solutions. We show in the paper that each step of the alternating minimization algorithm can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem in which the autocorrelation function of the precoders or decoders is obtained. Upon convergence, a final spectral factorization stage must be applied to obtain the precoders and decoders from their autocorrelation functions. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288506","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288506.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference leakage minimization for convolutive MIMO interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288506/","displayDocTitle":"Interference leakage minimization for convolutive MIMO interference channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967209","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288506/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference leakage minimization for convolutive MIMO interference channels","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046724S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288508,"authors":[{"name":"Hieu Duy Nguyen","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hieu Duy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37403915400"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274563900"},{"name":"Hon Tat Hui","affiliation":["ECE Department, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hon Tat","lastName":"Hui","id":"37284824900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288508","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Array signal processing","Collaboration","Downlink","Closed-form solutions","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","cellular radio","intercarrier interference","multi-access systems","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom region","multicell random beamforming","RBF","transmission scheme","multiuser multiantenna downlink system","asymptotic rate","intercell interference","cell scale","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","sum-rate","DoF region","DoF-optimal transmission","multicell system","transmit beams"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random beamforming (RBF)","degrees of freedom (DoF)","multi-cell system"]}],"abstract":"Random beamforming (RBF) is a practically favorable transmission scheme for multiuser multi-antenna downlink systems.

If data is to be sent to a far-away base station, collaborative beamforming by the sensors may help to distribute the load among the nodes and reduce fast battery depletion. However, collaborative beamforming techniques are far from optimality and in many cases may be wasting more power than required. In this contribution we consider the issue of energy efficiency in beamforming applications. Using a convex optimization framework, we propose the design of a virtual beamformer that maximizes the network's lifetime while satisfying a pre-specified Quality of Service (QoS) requirement.

Numerical simulations show the proposed heuristic compares favorably with the existing approaches in terms of both the number of supported links and speed.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288517","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288517.pdf","startPage":"2873","endPage":"2876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power and admission control via linear programming deflation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288517/","displayDocTitle":"Joint power and admission control via linear programming deflation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967220","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288517/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power and admission control via linear programming deflation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05392S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288520,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Khabbazibasmenj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Khabbazibasmenj","id":"37400208100"},{"name":"Sergiy A.

Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to the constrained maximization of the product of quadratic ratios that is a non-convex problem. Such problems appear also in many other applications. This problem can be further relaxed into a difference-of-convex functions (DC) programming problem, which is typically solved using the branch-and-bound method without polynomial-time complexity guarantees. We, however, develop a polynomial-time convex optimization-based algorithm for solving the corresponding DC programming problem named polynomial-time DC (POTDC). POTDC is based on a specific parameterization of the problem, semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation, linearization, and iterations over a single parameter. The complexity of the problem solved at each iteration of the algorithm is equivalent to that of the SDP problem. The effectiveness of the proposed POTDC method for the sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relay systems is shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial-time DC (POTDC) for sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relaying","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288520","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288520.pdf","startPage":"2889","endPage":"2892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial-time DC (POTDC) for sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relaying","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288520/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial-time DC (POTDC) for sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relaying","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067362S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288522,"authors":[{"name":"Lennart Gerdes","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Lennart","lastName":"Gerdes","id":"37545948200"},{"name":"Maximilian Riemensberger","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Riemensberger","id":"37302961900"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288522","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource description framework","Protocols","Vectors","MIMO","Complexity theory","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","MIMO communication","protocols","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility maximization","multiple input multiple output relay channel","half duplex two way MIMO relay channel","decode and forward communication","perfect channel information","time division duplex communication protocol","protocol phase","dual decomposition approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relay channel","MIMO","half-duplex","decode-and-forward","utility maximization"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses utility maximization problems in the half-duplex two-way multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channel, where the relay uses the decode-and-forward strategy.

More specifically, in our setup all wireless links are subjected to Rayleigh fading and Gaussian noise, and the relay node can be located at different distances from source and destination nodes. We assume that coded bits are fully-interleaved, so that the transmitted symbols are mutually independent. By exploiting factor graph representation, we propose a joint network/channel decoding algorithm, which takes into account decoding errors introduced by the relay node. The convergence of the proposed iterative decoding algorithm is studied through EXIT chart analysis. The proposed decoder is compared with a recently proposed algorithm, which employs the demodulate-and-forward protocol and works on coded bits, and it is shown that it provides better performance. More specifically, for a bit error rate (BER) equal to 1e-3, it is 1.5dB better when the relay is located near the destination and 2.0dB better when the relay is in between source and destination.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288523","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE

The log-likelihood ratio based decision rule is derived at the destination node. A semi-analytical power allocation strategy is presented by evaluating a closed-form expression for the effective signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, which is maximized by exhaustive search.

In this scheme, two secondary transmitters are used to alternately transmit secondary information to their respective receivers whilst relaying the primary signal at the same time. By using superposition coding at the secondary transmitters and successive decoding at the receivers, a diversity gain of 2 is obtained for the primary system without losing the bandwidth efficiency. Outage probabilities of the primary system and secondary system are analyzed. The optimal power allocation factor of the secondary system is determined to minimize the outage probability of the secondary system while maintaining the performance of the primary system. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can indeed enhance the outage performance of the primary and secondary systems simultaneously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12967228","htmlLink":"/document/6288525/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing based on two-path successive relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing based on two-path successive relaying","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053749S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288530,"authors":[{"name":"Xinping Yi","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Yi","id":"38469274000"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, EURECOM, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288530","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","MIMO","Transmitters","Interference channels","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast communication","information theory","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","precoding","radio links","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding","broadcast MIMO channel","delayed CSIT","finite SNR","information theory","multiuser downlink MIMO channel","delayed channel state information","transmitter","delayed channel feedback","feedback delay","channel coherence time","interference forwarding","signal enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","delayed feedback","precoding","multi-user"]}],"abstract":"Recent information theoretic results suggest that precoding on the multi-user downlink MIMO channel with delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) could lead to data rates much beyond the ones obtained without any CSIT, even in extreme situations when the delayed channel feedback is made totally obsolete by a feedback delay exceeding the channel coherence time. This surprising result is based on the ideas of interference forwarding and alignment which allow the receivers to reconstruct an information allowing them to cancel out the interference completely, making it an optimal scheme in the infinite SNR regime. In this paper, we formulate a similar problem, yet at finite SNR. We propose a new construction for the precoder which matches the previous results at infinite SNR yet reaches a useful tradeoff between interference alignment and signal enhancement at finite SNR, allowing for significant performance improvements in practical settings.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288530","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288530.pdf","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding on the broadcast MIMO channel with delayed CSIT: The finite SNR case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288530/","displayDocTitle":"Precoding on the broadcast MIMO channel with delayed CSIT: The finite SNR case","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967233","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288530/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding on the broadcast MIMO channel with delayed CSIT: The finite SNR case","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121308S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288531,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-Chen Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wan-Chen","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38469398800"},{"name":"Shang-Ho Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Ho","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37279553800"},{"name":"Pu-Hsuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pu-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"38006485700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288531","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity multimode antenna selection with bit allocation for zero-forcing receiver","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate multimode antenna selection for zero forcing receiver to maximize the overall data rate.

To reduce the complexity, we propose a greedy search algorithm for antenna selection. Using the proposed algorithm, the computations can be greatly reduced while the achievable data rate is nearly the same with exhaustive search.

Under an average only total transmit power constraint (APC), large antenna arrays at the BS (having tens to a few hundred antennas) have been recently shown to achieve remarkable multi-user interference (MUI) suppression with simple precoding techniques. However, building large arrays in practice, would require cheap/power-efficient Radio-Frequency (RF) electronic components. The type of transmitted signal that facilitates the use of most power-efficient RF components is a constant envelope (CE) signal (i.e., the amplitude of the signal transmitted from each antenna is constant for every channel use and every channel realization). Under certain mild channel conditions (including i.i.d. fading), we analytically show that, even under the stringent per-antenna CE transmission constraint (compared to APC), MUI suppression can still be achieved with large antenna arrays. Our analysis also reveals that, with a fixed M and increasing N, the total transmitted power can be reduced while maintaining a constant signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) level at each user. We also propose a novel low-complexity CE precoding scheme, using which, we confirm our analytical observations for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel, through Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation of the information sum-rate under the per-antenna CE constraint, shows that, for a fixed M and a fixed desired sum-rate, the required total transmit power decreases linearly with increasing N, i.e., an O(N) array power gain. Also, in terms of the total transmit power required to achieve a fixed desired information sum-rate, despite the stringent per-antenna CE constraint, the proposed CE precoding scheme performs close to the GBC sum-capacity (under APC) achieving scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288534","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"2949","endPage":"2952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant envelope precoding for power-efficient downlink wireless communication in multi-user MIMO systems using large antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constant envelope precoding for power-efficient downlink wireless communication in multi-user MIMO systems using large antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288534/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967237","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288534/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant envelope precoding for power-efficient downlink wireless communication in multi-user MIMO systems using large antenna arrays","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102497S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6288535,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469789500"},{"name":"Emiliano Dall'Anese","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Dall'Anese","id":"37392305700"},{"name":"Georgios B.

Numerical results are reported to corroborate the analytical findings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed robust beamforming for MIMO cognitive networks","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288535","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288535.pdf","startPage":"2953","endPage":"2956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Distributed robust beamforming for MIMO cognitive networks","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288535/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967238","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed robust beamforming for MIMO cognitive networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051233S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288538,"authors":[{"name":"Chiranjib Choudhuri","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiranjib","lastName":"Choudhuri","id":"37847187200"},{"name":"Abhishek Ghosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37598048600"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"},{"name":"Sudhakar Pamarti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhakar","lastName":"Pamarti","id":"37297591300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288538","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"abstract":"The analog imperfections in RF direct conversion receiver, of which I/Q imbalance is a major detriment, are examined.

This redundancy has been shown to be useful to combat channel impairments, when the subbands are transmitted over a wireless channel, as well as quantization noise. This paper describes an implementation of the maximum a posteriori and the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators of the input signal from the noisy quantized subbands obtained at the output of some transmission channel. The relations between the input samples and the noisy subband samples are described using a factor graph. Belief propagation is then applied to get the posterior marginals of the input samples. The experimental results show that when the channel is clear, a linear MMSE estimate performs quite well but the proposed approaches perform significantly better than a reconstruction using the linear MMSE estimator when the channel is noisy: a gain in terms of channel SNR of more than 2 dB is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288540/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12967243","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288540/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Map estimation of the input of an oversampled filter bank from noisy subbands by belief propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Map estimation of the input of an oversampled filter bank from noisy subbands by belief propagation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0002977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072294S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288543,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed method exploits the eigen-beamforming mode (EM) in MIMO systems which is a common feature in 4th generation standards: WiMAX and LTE. These systems use the same beamforming weights for dedicated pilots and data so the weights are interpreted as a channel effect from the receiver perspective. There is no need to invert the weights at the receiver side since it is compensated for in channel equalization. Beamforming performance depends on the relative phase difference between antennas but is unaffected by a phase shift common to all antennas. In contrast, PAPR changes with the common phase shift. An effective optimization technique based on Sequential Quadratic Programming is proposed to compute the common phase shifts that minimize the PAPR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding technique for peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) reduction in MIMO OFDM/A systems","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288547","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288547.pdf","startPage":"3005","endPage":"3008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Precoding technique for peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) reduction in MIMO OFDM/A systems","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288547/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding technique for peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) reduction in MIMO OFDM/A systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040588S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288548,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tong","affiliation":["Signal and System Theory Group, Universit\u00e4t Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tong","id":"37708062900"},{"name":"Peter J.

We focus on downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access and multiuser uplink random access. In both cases, frequency assignment, transmitted power, and coding mode are adapted to imperfect CSI in order to maximize expected transmission rate subject to average power constraints. Determination of optimal solutions is a non-convex stochastic optimization problem with infinitely many variables. Exploiting its property of null duality gap, we show that optimal solutions are determined by optimal dual variables. This affords considerable simplification because the dual optimization problem is convex and finite-dimensional.

This paper seeks to quantify the amount of interferences resulting from wideband channels which assumed to follow the multi-scale/multi-lag (MSML) model. Due to the fact that the mobility in wideband channels induces scale effects, Doppler is revealed in a manner distinct from the frequency shifts experienced in narrowband systems. The MSML channel model results in full channel matrices both in the frequency and time domains. However, banded approximations are still possible, leading to significant reduction in the equalization complexity. Herein, measures for determining whether time-domain or frequency-domain should be undertaken are provided based on the amount of the resulting interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288553.pdf","startPage":"3029","endPage":"3032","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time- or frequency-domain equalization for wideband OFDM channels?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Equalizers","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain equalization","time-domain equalization","wideband OFDM channel","intercarrier interference","time variation","multiscale-multilag channel model","scale effect","MSML channel model","channel matrix","banded approximation","equalization complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wideband channels","OFDM","equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Time- or frequency-domain equalization for wideband OFDM channels?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967256","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time- or frequency-domain equalization for wideband OFDM channels?","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066258S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288555,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37595351800"},{"name":"Jingjing Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37898607100"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288555","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Detectors","Complexity theory","MIMO","Iterative decoding","Adaptive systems","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","automatic repeat request","feedback","interference suppression","iterative methods","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive iterative decision multifeedback detection","multiuser MIMO systems","constellation constraints","multiuser multiantenna systems","interference cancellation","adaptive recursive least squares algorithm","time-varying channels","decision feedback detector","maximum likelihood detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","decision feedback receivers","RLS algorithms","multi-user detection","iterative processing"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive iterative decision multi-feedback detection algorithm with constellation constraints is proposed for multiuser multi-cantenna systems.

We further provide an equivalent but more practical form of the convex problem that can be efficiently handled with common optimization methods and software packages.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288557","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288557.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust maximin MIMO precoding for arbitrary convex uncertainty sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288557/","displayDocTitle":"Robust maximin MIMO precoding for arbitrary convex uncertainty sets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967260","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288557/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust maximin MIMO precoding for arbitrary convex uncertainty sets","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077829S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288559,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Medra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Medra","id":"37063093300"},{"name":"Timothy N.

The design of a feedback scheme to implement this strategy can be viewed as a (lossy) source compression problem on a Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading block is one approach to that problem, but it neglects any correlation between blocks. In some recent work, several approaches have been proposed to take advantage of this correlation. In this paper we propose an alternative technique that leverages existing Grassmannian codebooks from memoryless schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic interpolation. Distinguishing features of the proposed technique include the fact that it only requires a single codebook, and the fact that it enables the step length of the geodesic interpolation to be adapted to the channel realization, rather than the channel statistics. In some straightforward simulation experiments, the proposed approach provides better performance than an existing scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288559.pdf","startPage":"3053","endPage":"3056","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An incremental Grassmannian feedback scheme for linearly precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Transmitters","Receivers","Quantization","MIMO","Multiplexing","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interpolation","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transmitters","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental Grassmannian feedback scheme","linearly precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","transmitter adaptation","slow block-fading multiple-input multiple-output links","lossy source compression problem","memoryless vector quantization","Grassmannian codebooks","geodesic interpolation","channel realization","channel statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"An incremental Grassmannian feedback scheme for linearly precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288559/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967262","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An incremental Grassmannian feedback scheme for linearly precoded spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065112S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288562,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Chakareski","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory-LTS4, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Chakareski","id":"38521990200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288562","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Optimization","Peer to peer computing","Social network services","Vectors","Approximation methods","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","graph theory","information dissemination","Internet","Markov processes","optimisation","sampling methods","social networking (online)","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multigraph sampling","online community graphs","mean hitting time","social network","random walk models","multigraph ensemble","Markov chains","vertex set","branch and bound optimization technique","greedy optimization method","optimal subset approximation","complexity reduction","sampling cost reduction","information dissemination speed","node degree","eigenvector centrality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288562","abstract":"We derive a framework for sampling online communities based on the mean hitting time of its members, considering that there are multiple graphs associated with the same vertex set V representing the social network.

Having up-to-date distributed readings of grid conditions helps utilities efficiently scale generation up or down to meet demand. Narrowband powerline communication (PLC) systems can provide these up-to-date readings from subscribers to the local utility over existing power lines. A key challenge in PLC systems is overcoming additive non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose to use a cyclostationary model for the dominant component of additive non-Gaussian noise. The key contributions are (1) fitting measured data from outdoor narrowband PLC system field trials to a cyclostationary model, and (2) developing a cyclostationary noise generation model that fits measured data. We found that the period in the cyclostationary model matched half of the period of the main powerline frequency, which is consistent with previous work in indoor PLC additive noise modeling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288568.pdf","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3092","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary noise modeling in narrowband powerline communication for Smart Grid applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Narrowband","OFDM","Noise measurement","Smart grids","Spectrogram","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","intelligent control","signal processing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary noise modeling","narrowband powerline communication","smart grid applications","smart grid intelligent energy flows monitoring","smart grid intelligent energy flows control","electric grid conditions","distributed readings","narrowband powerline communication systems","additive nonGaussian noise","measured data fitting","outdoor narrowband PLC system","powerline frequency","PLC additive noise modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Powerline Communications","Smart Grid","Noise Modeling","Cyclostationarity","Linear Periodically Time-Varying (LPTV) Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary noise modeling in narrowband powerline communication for Smart Grid applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967271","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary noise modeling in narrowband powerline communication for Smart Grid applications","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054631S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288571,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Matamoros","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Matamoros","id":"38273029700"},{"name":"Carles Ant\u00f3n-Haro","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Carles","lastName":"Ant\u00f3n-Haro","id":"38272518500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288571","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Transforms","Vectors","Resource management","Covariance matrix","Estimation","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","precoding","sensors","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duty cycle impact","compressed observation","M2M capillary network","machine-to-machine network","spatial random field estimation","spatially correlated sensor","distributed precoding scheme","partial Karhunen-Lo`eve transform","partial KL transform","over-the-air compressed representation","closed-form expression","optimal power allocation strategy","estimation error minimization","benchmarking purpose"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288571","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288571","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on the use capillary M2M (Machine-to-Machine) networks for the estimation of spatial random fields.

We propose to leverage matched filters that already exist in many SUs to alleviate the impact of such SU interference by combining the matched filtering result and the energy detection result. The analysis shows that for practical purposes, our algorithm virtually eliminates all of the negative impact of SU interference with only negligible penalty in delay and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288583/","accessionNumber":"12967286","displayDocTitle":"Matched filtering assisted energy detection for sensing weak primary user signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched filtering assisted energy detection for sensing weak primary user signals","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045683S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6288584,"authors":[{"name":"Senay Negusse","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Senay","lastName":"Negusse","id":"38469508300"},{"name":"Per Zetterberg","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per","lastName":"Zetterberg","id":"37270124800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288584","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise","Estimation","Approximation algorithms","Standards","Channel estimation","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","phase noise","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost reference particle filter","data aided channel estimation","phase noise tracking","OFDM system","combined channel impulse response estimation","measurement equation","Rao-Blackwellization technique","CIR estimation","static channel state","OFDM symbol","mean squared error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Phase noise (PN)","Channel impulse response (CIR)","Cost reference particle filter (CRPF)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a robust technique based on cost reference particle filter (CRPF) for combined channel impulse response (CIR) estimation and phase noise (PN) tracking in OFDM systems without any priori information regarding the noise in the state and measurement equation.

We find the major contributors to the CFO measurement uncertainty are the additive white noise together with the inter-carrier interference (ICI). Our derivation results show the noise variance can be reduced via averaging while the ICI introduced uncertainty can be decreased by iterative CFO compensations. These considerations lead us to a Type-2 correction loop. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show our proposed algorithm is robust and able to compensate and track comparably large CFO.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288586.pdf","startPage":"3161","endPage":"3164","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM carrier frequency offset correction based on Type-2 control loop","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete Fourier transforms","Detectors","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM carrier frequency offset correction","type-2 control loop","robust data-aided carrier frequency offset tracking algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","intercarrier interference","additive white noise","ICI","type-2 correction loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Carrier Frequency Offset","Inter-carrier Interference","Pilot Tone Tracking","Type-2 Loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"OFDM carrier frequency offset correction based on Type-2 control loop","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967289","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM carrier frequency offset correction based on Type-2 control loop","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111847S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288587,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Romero","affiliation":["University of Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Romero","id":"38273603900"},{"name":"Roberto L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","affiliation":["University of Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","id":"38557369800"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288587","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288587","abstract":"We consider the problem of detecting a known signal with constant magnitude immersed in noise of unknown variance, when the propagation channel is frequency-flat and randomly time-varying within the observation window.

OFDM makes the system robust against intersymbol interference, whereas IDMA combats the multiple access interference. Nevertheless, two problems have to be solved: 1/ carrier frequency offset (CFO) must be estimated/corrected to guarantee the orthogonality between subcarriers. 2/ the conventional IDMA receiver requires a priori knowledge of the channel. Therefore, the CFO and the channel must be estimated. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we suggest a sigma point Kalman filter to solve the estimation issue. In addition, we propose a new scheme where a CFO correction is no longer necessary, unlike common OFDM approaches. We show that without a CFO correction, the transmitted bits can be recovered by modifying the conventional IDMA receiver. When considering an OFDM-IDMA network over Rayleigh fading channels, simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288598/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12967301","publicationDate":"March 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288598/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Frequency synchronization and channel equalization for an OFDM-IDMA uplink system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency synchronization and channel equalization for an OFDM-IDMA uplink system","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05675S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288600,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cheng","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38239657100"},{"name":"Sarah Drewes","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Drewes","id":"38234236400"},{"name":"Anne Philipp","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Philipp","id":"38231968800"},{"name":"Marius Pesavento","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Pesavento","id":"37285062000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288600","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Vectors","Computational complexity","Linear programming","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","computational complexity","frequency allocation","integer programming","interference (signal)","Long Term Evolution","relaxation theory","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint network optimization","coordinated multipoint transmission","mixed integer programming","4G standard","WiMAX","LTE-Advanced","intercell interference control","spectral efficiency","single frequency reuse network","CoMP operation","single basestation transmission","network complexity","operational cost","joint basestation selection","multicell beamforming","mixed integer second order cone programming approach","continuous relaxation","signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio level","mobile station"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated Multi-Point Transmission","Basestation Selection","Beamforming","Mixed Integer Conic Programming"]}],"abstract":"Coordinated Multi-Point Transmission (CoMP) has been proposed for 4G standards, like WiMAX and LTE-Advanced, as an effective mean to control intercell interference and to increase spectral efficiency in single frequency reuse networks. In practical systems, the remarkable benefits of CoMP operation over conventional single basestation transmission need to be traded against a significant overhead in network complexity and associated operational costs. In order to retain the benefits of CoMP at reasonable costs, we consider the problem of joint basestation selection and multicell beamforming (JBSB). We address this problem via a mixed integer second order cone programming (MI-SOCP) approach. We propose a novel MI-SOCP formulation of the JBSB problem and a reformulation with tighter continuous relaxations. Based on this formulation, we propose fast algorithms to find almost optimal feasible solutions.

Spectral diversity comes from opportunistic scheduling in the frequency domain enabled by the OFDMA technique, and is influenced by partial feedback design. By employing the best-M partial feedback strategy, we provide a unified view of spatial, spectral, and multiuser diversity through asymptotic (in users) analysis. We examine the tail behavior of the distribution of the received channel quality information (CQI) at the scheduler to prove the type of convergence as well as to derive the asymptotic approximations for the average spectral efficiency under partial feedback. We investigate the application of our analysis to different spatial diversity schemes. Our derived results can be used to quickly determine the minimum required partial feedback in a general multiuser MIMO-OFDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288601","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"3221","endPage":"3224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of a partial feedback OFDMA system employing spatial, spectral, and multiuser diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of a partial feedback OFDMA system employing spatial, spectral, and multiuser diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288601/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967304","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288601/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of a partial feedback OFDMA system employing spatial, spectral, and multiuser diversity","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069058S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288602,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","lastName":"V\u00e1zquez","id":"38274094000"},{"name":"Ana P\u00e9rez-Neira","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain","Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"P\u00e9rez-Neira","id":"38273848200"},{"name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel Lagunas","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Spain","Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","lastName":"Lagunas","id":"37284173800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288602","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Receivers","Array signal processing","Integrated circuits","Transmitters","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","MIMO communication","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO interference channel","asymmetric link gains","transmit beamforming technique","multiple input single output interference channel","interuser interference","sum-rate optimization","sum-rate approximation","received signal power level","multiuser interference power level","sum-rate expression","numerical simulations","channel gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","MISO Interference Channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288602","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288602","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"This paper proposes a transmit beamforming technique to cope with the problem of the Multiple Input Single Output Interference Channel (MISO IC).

In contrast, we present an alternative method of bounding the channel uncertainties, where we only limit the trace of the mismatch matrices. This approach leads to a problem formulation of reduced complexity as compared to the previous methods. Our goal is to minimize the total transmitted power subject to the worst-case user quality-of service (QoS) constraints. Lagrange duality is used to obtain a simple reformulation of the worst-case beamforming problem. The resulting non-convex problem can then be converted into a convex form using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) that can be solved efficiently using interior point methods. The resulting problem is a linear second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem as opposed to the quadratic SOCP problems in the previous robust approaches. Simulation results also show that the proposed method offers a significantly improved performance in terms of transmitted power.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"3229","endPage":"3232","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288603.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust downlink beamforming in multi-group multicasting using trace bounds on the covariance mismatches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288603/","displayDocTitle":"Robust downlink beamforming in multi-group multicasting using trace bounds on the covariance mismatches","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967306","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust downlink beamforming in multi-group multicasting using trace bounds on the covariance mismatches","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054071S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6288604,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Tajan","affiliation":["ETIS / ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Tajan","id":"37712509000"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["IRIT/ INP-ENSEEIHT, University of Toulouse III, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS / ENSEA, University of Cergy-Pontoise, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288604","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose, analyse and compare three different methods for opportunistic spectrum sharing access when the primary users implements an Incremental Redundancy (IR) type Hybrid Automatic ReQuest (H-ARQ) protocol. The first method consists in allowing the secondary user to communicate only during the first primary transmission round of the IR H-ARQ protocol. In this scenario, if the the secondary receiver fails to decode its message after the first round, it realizes a successive interference cancellation in the subsequent primary HARQ rounds by listening to the primary user. The second method consists in realizing a perfect interference cancellation at the secondary receiver with causal channel state information. In this method, the secondary user communicates only when the secondary receiver succeeds in decoding the primary message. To improve throughput performance at the secondary, the secondary pair is also considering the use of an IR-HARQ protocol. In a third method, the secondary user communicates following the same rule as in the proposed second method, but implementing an Adaptive Modulation and Coding scheme instead of HARQ. In particular, we show that this last protocol with a small number of interfered slots allows to limit the loss in the primary throughput needed for the secondary user to transmit.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing

We propose an eigenvalue-decomposition-based approach to channel estimation, that estimates the channel blindly from the received data. The approach exploits the asymptotic orthogonality of the channel vectors in very large MIMO systems. We show that the channel to each user can be estimated from the covariance matrix of the received signals, up to a remaining scalar multiplicative ambiguity. A short training sequence is required to resolve this ambiguity. Furthermore, to improve the performance of our approach, we combine it with the iterative least-square with projection (ILSP) algorithm.

This problem originated during the second WorldWar, and has been the subject of active research during the 70's, and 80's. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest due to the striking parallels between group testing and the now highly popular field of compressed sensing. In fact, boolean group testing is nothing but compressed sensing in a different algebra - with boolean `AND' and `OR' operations replacing vector space multiplication and addition. In this paper we review existing solutions for non-adaptive (batch) group testing and propose a linear programming relaxation solution, which has a resemblance to the basis pursuit algorithm for sparse recovery in linear models. We compare its performance to alternative methods for group testing.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288622","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288622.pdf","startPage":"3305","endPage":"3308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boolean compressed sensing: LP relaxation for group testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288622/","displayDocTitle":"Boolean compressed sensing: LP relaxation for group testing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12967325","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288622/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boolean compressed sensing: LP relaxation for group testing","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066863S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288624,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cafer Gurbuz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TOBB University of Economics and Technology, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali Cafer","lastName":"Gurbuz","id":"37266698900"},{"name":"Mert Pilanci","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mert","lastName":"Pilanci","id":"37646550900"},{"name":"Orhan Arikan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Orhan","lastName":"Arikan","id":"37350304900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288624","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Atomic measurements","Vectors","Image reconstruction","Indexes","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","greedy algorithms","iterative methods","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation maximization based matching pursuit algorithm","EMMP algorithm","iterative EM based framework","standard greedy methods","orthogonal matching pursuit","signal reconstruction errors","greedy algorithms","compressive sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse reconstruction","compressive sensing","greedy methods","expectation maximization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288624","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288624.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expectation maximization based matching pursuit","abstract":"A novel expectation maximization based matching pursuit (EMMP) algorithm is presented.

The results show that the proposed method has lower reconstruction errors compared to other greedy algorithms using the same conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288624/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966244","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Expectation maximization based matching pursuit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expectation maximization based matching pursuit","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052209S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6288625,"authors":[{"name":"Volker Pohl","affiliation":["Chair for Theoretical Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37278855900"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Chair for Theoretical Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288625","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288625","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Hilbert space","Silicon","Gold","Vectors","Technological innovation","Argon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hilbert spaces","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["U-invariant sampling","stable reconstruction","atomic spaces","arbitrary Hilbert space","signal reconstruction","signal recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic spaces","sampling","stationary sequences"]}],"abstract":"Given a U-invariant sampling scheme on an arbitrary Hilbert space \u210b.

sensing is a key component of the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. Among CR detectors, multiantenna detectors are gaining popularity since they improve the detection performance and are robust to noise uncertainties. Traditional approaches to multiantenna spectrum sensing are based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) or other heuristic detectors, which are not optimal in the Neyman-Pearson sense. In this work, we derive the locally most powerful invariant test (LMPIT), which is the optimal detector, among those preserving the problem invariances, in the low SNR regime. In particular, we apply Wijsman's theorem, which provides us an alternative way to derive the ratio of the distributions of the maximal invariant statistic. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed detector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12966275","htmlLink":"/document/6288655/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"The locally most powerful test for multiantenna spectrum sensing with uncalibrated receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The locally most powerful test for multiantenna spectrum sensing with uncalibrated receivers","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0412S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288657,"authors":[{"name":"Yijiu Zhao","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yijiu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38238806700"},{"name":"Yu Hen Hu","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Yu Hen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277445900"},{"name":"Houjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Houjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280099600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288657","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"abstract":"The feasibility of compressed sensing (CS) based waveform-reconstruction for data sampled from random equivalent sampling (RES) method is investigated.

For reconstruction from the level crossings we make use of the sparse reconstruction based optimization by constraining the bandpass signal to be sparse in its frequency content. While overdetermined system of equations is resorted to in the literature we use an undetermined approach along with sparse reconstruction formulation. We could get a reconstruction SNR >; 20dB and perfect support recovery with probability close to 1, in noise-less case and with lower probability in the noisy case. Random picking of LC from different levels over the same limited signal duration and for the same length of information, is seen to be advantageous for reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288659","startPage":"3453","endPage":"3456","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288659.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse signal reconstruction based on signal dependent non-uniform samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Sparse signal reconstruction based on signal dependent non-uniform samples","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288659/","accessionNumber":"12966279","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288659/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse signal reconstruction based on signal dependent non-uniform samples","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040251S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288662,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mansour","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Mansour","id":"37411968700"},{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr Yilmaz","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38241819100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288662","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Standards","Compressed sensing","Approximation methods","Weight measurement","Vectors","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","compressed sensing","filtering theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive compressed sensing","video acquisition","support estimate","sparse filtering","measurement matrix","signal coefficients","video compressive acquisition","reconstruction quality","adaptive recovery","weighted \u21131 minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","adaptive measurements","weighted acquisition","video acquisition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive compressed sensing scheme that utilizes a support estimate to focus the measurements on the large valued coefficients of a compressible signal.

We exploited these concepts to design critically sampled two-channel wavelet filterbanks for any bipartite graph. For arbitrary graphs, we proposed a bipartite subgraph decomposition scheme to decompose the graph into edge-disjoint bipartite subgraphs and apply filtering and downsampling separately on each subgraph. This leads to the design of multi-dimensional separable filterbanks on graphs. In this paper, we study these bipartite decompositions in more detail. In particular, we describe the meaning of dimensionality in the subgraph decomposition of arbitrary graphs and define some graph based metrics based on this understanding. Subsequently, we propose a heuristics based algorithm for bipartite subgraph decomposition and compare it with other non-optimized algorithms.

The asymptotic behavior of the estimator is also investigated, and it is proved that this method is a consistent estimator.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288674","startPage":"3513","endPage":"3516","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288674.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlogram for undersampled data: Bias and variance analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Correlogram for undersampled data: Bias and variance analysis","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288674/","accessionNumber":"12966294","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288674/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlogram for undersampled data: Bias and variance analysis","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051478S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288678,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Yazdian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Yazdian","id":"37828475900"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Bastani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hassan","lastName":"Bastani","id":"37297582300"},{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Gazor","id":"37273433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288678","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix","Arrays","Limiting","Transforms","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","exponential distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponentially windowed sample covariance matrix","limiting spectral distribution","LSD","SCM","complex array data","random matrix theory","doubly correlated Wishart matrices","noise-only data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","Limiting Spectral Distribution","Random Matrix Theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288678","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288678.pdf","startPage":"3529","endPage":"3532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral distribution of the exponentially windowed sample covariance matrix","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effect of applying an exponential window on the limiting spectral distribution (l.s.d.) of the exponentially windowed sample covariance matrix (SCM) of complex array data.

Depending on how to treat the symbols and the channel, we have previously derived different versions of CRB. Specifically, we have dealt with the cases where the symbols and/or the channel are assumed to be either deterministic unknowns or random. Moreover, the symbols have been considered to be either jointly estimated with the channel or marginalized. All in all, we have derived six different versions of Bayesian and deterministic CRBs. However, we have shown that many of these CRBs are too optimistic in the sense that they are not strict enough to be attained by any deterministic or Bayesian estimator. In this paper we propose modified versions of those loose CRBs in the context of SIMO FIR system that are valid at least in the moderate and high SNR regimes.

This sparsity is measured with respect to some known dictionary consisting of a finite number of atoms. Most models for real world signals, however, are parametrised by continuous parameters corresponding to a dictionary with an infinite number of atoms. Examples of such parameters are the temporal and spatial frequency. In this paper, we analyse how CS affects the estimation performance of any unbiased estimator when we assume such infinite dictionaries. We base our analysis on the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) which is frequently used for benchmarking the estimation accuracy of unbiased estimators. For the popular sensing matrices such as the Gaussian sensing matrix, our analysis shows that compressed sensing on average degrades the estimation accuracy by at least the down-sample factor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On compressed sensing and the estimation of continuous parameters from noisy observations","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288697","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288697.pdf","startPage":"3609","endPage":"3612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"On compressed sensing and the estimation of continuous parameters from noisy observations","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288697/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966317","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On compressed sensing and the estimation of continuous parameters from noisy observations","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085929S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288705,"authors":[{"name":"Noam Wagner","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Noam","lastName":"Wagner","id":"38269447200"},{"name":"Yonina C.

These demands typically imply increasing the number of transducer elements involved in each imaging cycle. Confined to traditional sampling methods, the inevitable result is a significant growth in the amount of raw data that needs to be transmitted from the system front end, and then processed by the processing unit, effecting machinery size and power consumption. In this paper, we derive a scheme which reduces the amount of transmitted data, by applying Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques to analog ultrasound signals detected in the transducer elements. We follow the spirit of Xampling, which combines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in CS, aimed at sampling analog signals far below the Nyquist rate. Our scheme enhances SNR, by integrating low-rate samples extracted from multiple transducer elements.

Our strategy relies on minimizing a least-squares (LS) objective, which is generally non-convex and might possess many local minima.

By drawing analogy between the problem of block-sparse signal recovery and the problem of communication over Gaussian multi-input and single-output multiple access channel, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition under which exact support recovery is possible. Based on the results, we show that block-sparse signals can reduce the number of measurements required for exact support recovery, by at least `1/(block size)', compared to conventional or scalar-sparse signals. The minimum gain is guaranteed by increased signal to noise power ratio (SNR) and reduced effective number of entries (i.e., not individual elements but blocks) that are dominant at low SNR and at high SNR, respectively. When the correlation between the elements of each nonzero block is low, a larger gain than `1/(block size)' is expected due to, so called, diversity effect, especially in the moderate and low SNR regime.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288716.pdf","startPage":"3685","endPage":"3688","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the benefits of the block-sparsity structure in sparse signal recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"On the benefits of the block-sparsity structure in sparse signal recovery","htmlLink":"/document/6288716/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12966336","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the benefits of the block-sparsity structure in sparse signal recovery","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075315S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6288722,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Muma","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Muma","id":"37399965600"},{"name":"Yao Cheng","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38469649200"},{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"},{"name":"Abdelhak M.

We discuss the meaning of impropriety, and the associated use of complementary statistics, when a real-valued random process is improper in the frequency domain. Through the use of modulation signal models, spectral impropriety can be connected explicitly to the frequency and phase of components belonging to a periodic, or more generally rhythmic, modulator waveform. We give theoretical signal models and provide an example of complementary analysis on underwater propeller noise from a merchant ship.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Noise","Speech","Frequency domain analysis","Propellers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","modulation","random processes","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real rhythmic signals","spectral impropriety estimation","complex signal processing","complementary statistics","real-valued random process","frequency domain","modulation signal models","modulator waveform","theoretical signal models","underwater propeller noise","a merchant ship"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modulation","nonstationary process","improper","periodical correlation","spectral analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288723","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288723.pdf","startPage":"3713","endPage":"3716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Existence and estimation of impropriety in real rhythmic signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Existence and estimation of impropriety in real rhythmic signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288723/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288723/","accessionNumber":"12966343","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Existence and estimation of impropriety in real rhythmic signals","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047377S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6288725,"authors":[{"name":"Guifeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Guifeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38067827300"},{"name":"Victor DeBrunner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"DeBrunner","id":"37270700700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288725","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288725","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Matching pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Uncertainty","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","interpolation","signal resolution","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution nonparametric spectral estimation","Hirschman optimal transform","joint localization","signal uncertainty","signal concentration","Heisenberg-Weyl measure","continuous-time signals","discrete Fourier transform","discrete cosine transform","pure tones","stationary spectral estimation method","orthogonal matching pursuit method","smoothed HOT-DFT periodogram","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","frequency estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hirschman Optimal Transform","Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","Periodogram","Quinn's method"]}],"abstract":"The traditional Heisenberg-Weyl measure quantifies the joint localization, uncertainty, or concentration of a signal in the phase plane based on a product of energies expressed as signal variances in time and in frequency. Unlike the Heisenberg-Weyl measure, the Hirschman notion of joint uncertainty is based on the entropy rather than the energy [1]. Furthermore, its definition extends naturally from the case of infinitely supported continuous-time signals to the cases of both finitely and infinitely supported discrete-time signals, and, as we noted in [2], the Hirschman optimal transform (HOT) is superior to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) in terms of its ability to separate or resolve two limiting cases of localization in frequency, viz pure tones and additive white noise. In this paper we implement a stationary spectral estimation method using an orthogonal matching pursuit method whose dictionary members are constructed from the combination of HOT-based and DFT atoms (elements) [3] in combination with the interpolating procedure developed in [4]. We call the resulting algorithm the smoothed HOT-DFT periodogram. We compare its performance (in terms of frequency resolution) to Quinn's smoothed periodogram. In particular, we compare the performance of the HOT-DFT with that of the DFT in resolving two close frequency components in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We find the HOT-DFT to be superior to the DFT in frequency estimation, and ascribe the difference to the HOT's relationship to entropy.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288725.pdf","startPage":"3721","endPage":"3724","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution non-parametric spectral estimation using the Hirschman optimal transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution non-parametric spectral estimation using the Hirschman optimal transform","htmlLink":"/document/6288725/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12966345","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution non-parametric spectral estimation using the Hirschman optimal transform","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04646S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288726,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37717167300"},{"name":"Rueywen Liu","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Rueywen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275368100"},{"name":"Fan He","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"He","id":"37707055200"},{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291214800"},{"name":"Bo Hu","affiliation":["Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hu","id":"37275649000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288726","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"abstract":"Blind channel estimation is a promising technique to reduce the pilot overhead.

A single moving sensor can take measurements over a wide spatial area thus acting as a substitute for a potentially large number of static sensors. A moving sensor encounters the spatial field in its path in the form of a time-domain signal. Hence a time-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed at the mobile sensor to limit the amount of out-of-band noise prior to sampling.

This sampling scheme uses two interleaved sample sequences at the same rate chosen according to the Landau criterion. The associated exact reconstruction formula is composed of two series with cardinal sine functions as general terms. In practical applications, the signal is observed on a finite window. The exact reconstruction formula is then approached by truncation of the series. The series rate of convergence has thus a strong influence on the reconstruction performance in practice. Unfortunately, the cardinal sine functions lead to a slow convergence. In the case of an over-sampled process, we propose interpolation formulas derived from raised cosine filters.

Computer simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods with computational cost of approximately O(K).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio","Maximum likelihood estimation","Probability density function","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","maximum likelihood estimation","measurement systems","particle swarm optimisation","probability","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Diracs sequence reconstruction","noisy samples","maximum likelihood estimation","noisy uniform measurement vector","estimation parameters","probability density function","PDF","log-likelihood function","nearest sequence","noisy sequence","Fourier domain","particle swarm optimization search","PSO search","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequence of Diracs","signals with finite rate of innovation","annihilating filter","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288746","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288746.pdf","startPage":"3805","endPage":"3808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of the sequence of Diracs from noisy samples via maximum likelihood estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of the sequence of Diracs from noisy samples via maximum likelihood estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288746/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288746/","accessionNumber":"12966364","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of the sequence of Diracs from noisy samples via maximum likelihood estimation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035537S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288756,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Lindsten","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Lindsten","id":"37546508300"},{"name":"Thomas B.

The resulting method was shown to be an efficient tool for joint Bayesian parameter and state inference in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. However, the mixing of the PG kernel can be very poor when there is severe degeneracy in the PF. Hence, the success of the PG sampler heavily relies on the, often unrealistic, assumption that we can implement a PF without suffering from any considerate degeneracy. However, as pointed out by Whiteley [2] in the discussion following [1], the mixing can be improved by adding a backward simulation step to the PG sampler. Here, we investigate this further, derive an explicit PG sampler with backward simulation (denoted PG-BSi) and show that this indeed is a valid MCMC method. Furthermore, we show in a numerical example that backward simulation can lead to a considerable increase in performance over the standard PG sampler.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Joints","Smoothing methods","Kernel","Monte Carlo methods","Approximation methods","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","particle filtering (numerical methods)","sampling methods","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle Gibbs sampler","particle filter","PF","Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler","MCMC sampler","joint Bayesian parameter","state inference","nonlinear nonGaussian state-space models","PG kernel","backward simulation","standard PG sampler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo","particle filter","particle Gibbs","backward simulation","Gibbs sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288756","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288756.pdf","startPage":"3845","endPage":"3848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of backward simulation in the particle Gibbs sampler","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the use of backward simulation in the particle Gibbs sampler","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288756/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288756/","accessionNumber":"12966374","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of backward simulation in the particle Gibbs sampler","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0003845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060367S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288760,"authors":[{"name":"Bingxin Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Stony Brook, NY"],"firstName":"Bingxin","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085683086"},{"name":"M\u00f3nica F.

Although there has been a strong focus on the use of correct statistical models for spectral weighting rules for the last few decades, there is just a few publications about SPU estimation based on a speech prior consistent with the spectral weighting rule. This contribution presents a new consistent solution for MMSE speech amplitude (SA) estimation under SPU, being based on the generalized gamma distribution representing a variety of speech priors. Employing the gamma speech model which is a special case of the generalized gamma distribution, the new approach is shown to outperform both the SPU-based MMSE-SA estimator relying on a Gaussian speech prior, and the gamma MMSE-SA estimation without SPU.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Noise","Speech enhancement","Estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gamma distribution","Gaussian processes","least mean squares methods","spectral analysis","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech presence uncertainty","speech priors throughout","statistical models","spectral weighting rules","speech amplitude","SPU-based MMSE-SA estimator","Gaussian speech prior","speech enhancement approaches","generalized gamma distribution"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288803","startPage":"4033","endPage":"4036","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288803.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE speech enhancement under speech presence uncertainty assuming (generalized) gamma speech priors throughout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MMSE speech enhancement under speech presence uncertainty assuming (generalized) gamma speech priors throughout","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12966421","publicationDate":"March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288803/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE speech enhancement under speech presence uncertainty assuming (generalized) gamma speech priors throughout","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057191S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288804,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zeng","affiliation":["Signal and Information Processing Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38469467000"},{"name":"Richard C.

Since the DDSB performs only local signal processing, it is robust and scalable for large sensor networks and dynamic environments.

We observe top performance on clean speech, and under high noise conditions, compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and DNNs, with the added benefit of being a \u201cdeeper\u201d model than an MLP but more compact than a DNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288816","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288816.pdf","startPage":"4085","endPage":"4088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting Recurrent Neural Networks for robust ASR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288816/","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Recurrent Neural Networks for robust ASR","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966434","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288816/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Recurrent Neural Networks for robust ASR","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067307S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6288821,"authors":[{"name":"Julien van Hout","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"van Hout","id":"38469535400"},{"name":"Abeer Alwan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Abeer","lastName":"Alwan","id":"37284892600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288821","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Speech","Speech recognition","Noise measurement","Estimation","Hidden Markov models","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","masks","median filters","speech recognition","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust speech recognition","soft-mask estimation","log-spectral enhancement","Mel-filtered log spectra","noisy speech","soft-decision mask","Mel-spectral domain","time-frequency correlation","median filtering","median blurring","multiplicative coefficients","log-spectral flooring","liftered spectra","clean speech","Aurora-2 corpus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech Recognition","Feature Extraction","Speech Enhancement","Mask Estimation","Median Filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288821","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288821.pdf","startPage":"4105","endPage":"4108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to soft-mask estimation and Log-Spectral enhancement for robust speech recognition","abstract":"This paper describes a technique for enhancing the Mel-filtered log spectra of noisy speech, with application to noise robust speech recognition. We first compute an SNR-based soft-decision mask in the Mel-spectral domain as an indicator of speech presence. Then, we exploit the known time-frequency correlation of speech by treating this mask as an image, and performing median filtering and blurring to remove the outliers and to smooth the decision regions. This mask constitutes a set of multiplicative coefficients (ranging in [0,1]) that are used to discard the unreliable parts of the Mel-filtered log-spectrum of noisy speech. Finally, we apply Log-Spectral Flooring [1] on the liftered spectra of both clean and noisy speech so as to match their respective dynamic ranges and to emphasize the information in the spectral peaks. The noisy MFCCs computed on these modified log-spectra show an increased similarity with their corresponding clean MFCCs. Evaluation on the Aurora-2 corpus shows that the proposed approach competes with state-of-the-art front-ends, like ETSI-AFE, MVA or PNCC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966439","htmlLink":"/document/6288821/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to soft-mask estimation and Log-Spectral enhancement for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to soft-mask estimation and Log-Spectral enhancement for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045285S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288824,"authors":[{"name":"Vikramjit Mitra","affiliation":["Speech Technology and Research Laboratory, SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vikramjit","lastName":"Mitra","id":"38351185500"},{"name":"Horacio Franco","affiliation":["Speech Technology and Research Laboratory, SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Horacio","lastName":"Franco","id":"37284913200"},{"name":"Martin Graciarena","affiliation":["Speech Technology and Research Laboratory, SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Graciarena","id":"37284911900"},{"name":"Arindam Mandal","affiliation":["Speech Technology and Research Laboratory, SRI International, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37645792100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288824","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Speech","Noise","Noise robustness","Hidden Markov models","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","noise","speech recognition","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normalized amplitude modulation feature","large vocabulary noise-robust speech recognition","channel degradations","background noise","human speech recognition performance","automatic speech recognition systems","human auditory system","teager nonlinear energy operator","normalized modulation cepstral coefficient features","NMCC features","renoised wall street journal corpus","renoised WSJ corpus","WSJ word-recognition experiments","SRI DECIPHER large vocabulary speech recognition system","Aurora-2 digit recognition task","standard HTK recognizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise-Robust Speech Recognition","Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition","Modulation Features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288824","abstract":"Background noise and channel degradations seriously constrain the performance of state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. Studies comparing human speech recognition performance with automatic speech recognition systems indicate that the human auditory system is highly robust against background noise and channel variabilities compared to automated systems. A traditional way to add robustness to a speech recognition system is to construct a robust feature set for the speech recognition model. In this work, we present an amplitude modulation feature derived from Teager's nonlinear energy operator that is power normalized and cosine transformed to produce normalized modulation cepstral coefficient (NMCC) features. The proposed NMCC features are compared with respect to state-of-the-art noise-robust features in Aurora-2 and a renoised Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. The WSJ word-recognition experiments were performed on both a clean and artificially renoised WSJ corpus using SRI's DECIPHER large vocabulary speech recognition system. The experiments were performed under three train-test conditions: (a) matched, (b) mismatched, and (c) multi-conditioned. The Aurora-2 digit recognition task was performed using the standard HTK recognizer distributed with Aurora-2. Our results indicate that the proposed NMCC features demonstrated noise robustness in almost all the training-test conditions of renoised WSJ data and also improved digit recognition accuracies for Aurora-2 compared to the MFCCs and state-of-the-art noise-robust features.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288824","startPage":"4117","endPage":"4120","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288824.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized amplitude modulation features for large vocabulary noise-robust speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Normalized amplitude modulation features for large vocabulary noise-robust speech recognition","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288824/","accessionNumber":"12966442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288824/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized amplitude modulation features for large vocabulary noise-robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062817S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288826,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Sundaram","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom Research and Development Laboratories, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Shiva","lastName":"Sundaram","id":"37604319300"},{"name":"Jerome R.

The basic idea is to leverage a reduced dimensionality description of the observations to derive acoustic prototypes that are closely aligned with perceived acoustic events. Our initial work adopted a bag-of-frames strategy to represent relevant acoustic information within speech segments. In this paper, we extend this approach by better integrating temporal information into the LPM feature extraction. Specifically, we use variable-length units to represent acoustic events at the supra-frame level, in order to benefit from finer temporal alignments when deriving the acoustic prototypes. The outcome can be viewed as a generalization of both conventional template-based approaches and recently proposed sparse representation solutions. This extension is experimentally validated on a context-independent phoneme classification task using the TIMIT corpus.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288826","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288826.pdf","startPage":"4125","endPage":"4128","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latent perceptual mapping with data-driven variable-length acoustic units for template-based speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Latent perceptual mapping with data-driven variable-length acoustic units for template-based speech recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966444","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288826/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent perceptual mapping with data-driven variable-length acoustic units for template-based speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047762S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6288833,"authors":[{"name":"Tara N.

Recently, an alternative structure was proposed which trains a NN with a constant number of hidden units to predict output targets, and then reduces the dimensionality of these output probabilities through an auto-encoder, to create auto-encoder bottleneck (AE-BN) features. The benefit of placing the BN after the posterior estimation network is that it avoids the loss in frame classification accuracy incurred by networks that place the BN before the softmax. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-training when creating AE-BN features. Our experiments indicate that with the AE-BN architecture, pre-trained and deeper NNs produce better AE-BN features. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, the AE-BN features provide over a 1% absolute improvement compared to a state-of-the-art GMM/HMM with a WER of 18.8% and pre-trained NN hybrid system with a WER of 18.4%. In addition, on a larger 430-hour Broadcast News task, AE-BN features provide a 0.5% absolute improvement over a strong GMM/HMM baseline with a WER of 16.0%.

recognition systems and may lead to better results than systems applying other widely used classifiers such as Support Vector Machines or feedforward Neural Networks. The good performance of BLSTM emotion recognition systems could be attributed to their ability to model and exploit contextual information self-learned via recurrently connected memory blocks which allows them to incorporate information about how emotion evolves over time. However, the actual amount of bidirectional context that a BLSTM classifier takes into account when classifying an observation has not been investigated so far. This paper presents a methodology to systematically investigate the number of past and future utterance-level observations that are considered to generate an emotion prediction for a given utterance, and to examine to what extent this temporal bidirectional context contributes to the overall BLSTM performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966452","htmlLink":"/document/6288834/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the memory of BLSTM Neural Networks for enhanced emotion classification in dyadic spoken interactions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the memory of BLSTM Neural Networks for enhanced emotion classification in dyadic spoken interactions","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07377S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288837,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Speech Research Group, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Sabato Marco Siniscalchi","affiliation":["Department of Telematics, Kore University of Enna, Enna, Italy"],"firstName":"Sabato Marco","lastName":"Siniscalchi","id":"37267054000"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Speech Research Group, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288837","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":437},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting attribute and phone estimation accuracies with deep neural networks for detection-based speech recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288837.pdf","startPage":"4169","endPage":"4172","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288837","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech recognition","Detectors","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Training","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","neural nets","speech processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection-based bottom-up speech recognition","attribute estimation accuracy","phone estimation accuracy","deep neural networks","high-precision sub-phonetic attribute","phonological features","phone lattices","hidden layers","Nov92 WSJ data","frame-level attribute estimation","phone detection","frame-level accuracy","top-down search strategy","bottom-up search strategy","lattice-based search strategy","knowledge integration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automatic speech attribute transcription","deep neural networks","detection-based ASR","phonological features","attribute detection","phone recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288837","abstract":"Generation of high-precision sub-phonetic attribute (also known as phonological features) and phone lattices is a key frontend component for detection-based bottom-up speech recognition.

A range of DNN architectures with five to seven hidden layers and up to 2048 hidden units per layer have been explored. Training on the SI84 and testing on the Nov92 WSJ data, the proposed DNNs achieve significant improvements over the shallow MLPs, producing greater than 90% frame-level attribute estimation accuracies for all 21 attributes tested for the full system. On the phone detection task, we also obtain excellent frame-level accuracy of 86.6%.

The transducers are processed into a two-layer hierarchy: at a high level, it is analogous to a word lattice, and each word transition embodies an HMM-state subgraph for that word at a lower level. This hierarchy combined with the appropriate customization of the transducers leads to a flexible implementation for all of the training criteria being discussed.

The success is largely attributed to the use of local filtering and max-pooling in the CNN architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply CNN to speech recognition within the framework of hybrid NN-HMM model. We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance. In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288864/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12966482","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6288864/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying Convolutional Neural Networks concepts to hybrid NN-HMM model for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Convolutional Neural Networks concepts to hybrid NN-HMM model for speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057782S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"369","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6288865,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Saeb","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Shahr-e-Rey Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Saeb","id":"38243297400"},{"name":"Farbod Razzazi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farbod","lastName":"Razzazi","id":"37396056100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288865","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Training","Accuracy","Signal processing algorithms","Support vector machines","Complexity theory","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","pattern classification","speech recognition","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","phoneme classification","common CS classification","N-best class selector","secondary classifier","tree search","test utterance","empirical risk reduction","computational complexity","recognition phase"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Phoneme classification"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new fast compressive sensing (CS) algorithm for phoneme classification is introduced.

Speech and noise are modeled as independent RBMs, and the interaction between them is explicitly modeled to capture how speech and noise combine to generate observed noisy speech features. In contrast with RBMs, where the bottom layer of random variables is observed, inference in the FHRBM is intractable, scaling exponentially with the number of hidden units. We introduce variational algorithms for efficient approximate inference that scale linearly with the number of hidden units. Compared to traditional factorial models of noisy speech, which are based on GMMs, the FHRBM has the advantage that the representations of both speech and noise are highly distributed, allowing the model to learn a parts-based representation of noisy speech data that can generalize better to previously unseen noise compositions. Preliminary results suggest that the approach is promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966487","htmlLink":"/document/6288869/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Factorial Hidden Restricted Boltzmann Machines for noise robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factorial Hidden Restricted Boltzmann Machines for noise robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082374S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6288870,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37632406400"},{"name":"Biing-Hwang Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Biing-Hwang","lastName":"Juang","id":"38109154700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288870","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Data models","Probability","Speech","Synchronization","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stranded GAUSSIAN mixture hidden MARKOV models","robust speech recognition","SGMM-HMM model","mixture components","Aurora 2 database","WER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Bayesian network","Gaussian mixture model","hidden Markov model","robust speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"Gaussian mixture (GMM)-HMMs, though being the predominant modeling technique for speech recognition, are often criticized as being inaccurate to model heterogeneous data sources.

We evaluated the proposed MLLP and MAPLP on the Aurora-2 database in an unsupervised model adaptation manner. Experimental results show that the LP function outperforms the LR function with both ML- and MAP-based estimates over different test conditions. Moreover, because the MAP-based estimate can handle over-fittings well, MAPLP has clear improvements over MLLP.

The environment transforms are obtained during training using constrained-MLLR (CMLLR) framework, while for speaker-transforms we use the analytically determined linear-VTLN matrices.

The proposed method is simple since it involves only the choice of pre-computed environment and speaker transforms and therefore, can be applied with very little test data unlike many other speaker and noise-compensation methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust speech recognition through selection of speaker and environment transforms","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288878","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288878.pdf","startPage":"4333","endPage":"4336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust speech recognition through selection of speaker and environment transforms","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288878/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966495","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speech recognition through selection of speaker and environment transforms","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079154S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288897,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37419739100"},{"name":"Frank Seide","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Seide","id":"37284532700"},{"name":"Gang Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Li","id":"37715667400"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288897","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":812},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting sparseness in deep neural networks for large vocabulary speech recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288897.pdf","startPage":"4409","endPage":"4412","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288897","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Data structures","Speech recognition","Computational modeling","Speech","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","gradient methods","neural nets","random processes","speech recognition","stochastic processes","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","large vocabulary speech recognition","parameter sparseness","soft regularization","convex constraint optimization problem","stochastic gradient ascent","data structure","random sparseness pattern","model size reduction","voice-search dataset","switchboard dataset","nonzero connection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","deep belief networks","deep neural networks","sparseness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288897","abstract":"Recently, we developed context-dependent deep neural network (DNN) hidden Markov models for large vocabulary speech recognition.

We formulate the goal of enforcing sparseness as soft regularization and convex constraint optimization problems, and propose solutions under the stochastic gradient ascent setting. We also propose novel data structures to exploit the random sparseness patterns to reduce model size and computation time. The proposed solutions have been evaluated on the voice-search and switchboard datasets. They have decreased the number of nonzero connections to one third while reducing the error rate by 0.2-0.3% over the fully connected model on both datasets. The nonzero connections have been further reduced to only 12% and 19% on the two respective datasets without sacrificing speech recognition performance. Under these conditions we can reduce the model size to 18% and 29%, and computation to 14% and 23%, respectively, on these two datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12965985","htmlLink":"/document/6288897/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploiting sparseness in deep neural networks for large vocabulary speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting sparseness in deep neural networks for large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066669S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":6288930,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf Huber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Anthropomatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Huber","id":"38469456600"},{"name":"Florian Kraft","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Anthropomatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kraft","id":"37687818200"},{"name":"Alex Waibel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Anthropomatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Waibel","id":"37284492500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288930","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288930","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Speech","Microphones","Time frequency analysis","Equations","Mathematical model","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphones","phase locked loops","reverberation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind dereverberation","sinusoid signals","PLL-based combined phase analysis","amplitude analysis","blind single-microphone method","phase-locked-loop","phase offset","reverberated recording","amplitude offset","single reverberated wavefronts","direct-to-reverberant ratio","delay-and-sum beamformer","real speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dereverberation","Phase-Locked-Loop","PLL","Echo","Robust Speech Recognition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a new `blind' single-microphone method for the dereverberation of sinusoid signals is presented.

However, the computational cost of VTS model adaptation (MVTS) methods hinders them from being widely used because they need to adapt all the HMM parameters for every utterance at runtime. In contrast, VTS feature enhancement (FVTS) methods have more computation advantages because they do not need multiple decoding passes and do not adapt all the HMM model parameters. In this paper, we propose two improvements to VTS feature enhancement: updating all of the environment distortion parameters and noise adaptive training of the front-end GMM. In addition, we investigate some other performance-related issues such as the selection of FVTS algorithms and the spectrum domain that MFCC is extracted from. As an important result of our investigation, we established the FVTS method can achieve comparable accuracy as the MVTS method with a smaller runtime cost. This makes FVTS method an ideal candidate for real world tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288962.pdf","startPage":"4677","endPage":"4680","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvements to VTS feature enhancement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Adaptation models","Speech","Noise","Accuracy","Nonlinear distortion","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","distortion","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","speech enhancement","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech signals distortion","vector Taylor series-based model adaptation","speech recognizers","environmental noise","computational cost","VTS model adaptation method","MVTS methods","VTS feature enhancement methods","FVTS methods","multiple decoding passes","HMM model parameters","environment distortion parameters","noise adaptive training","front-end GMM","real world tasks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VTS","feature enhancement","model adaptation","robust ASR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Improvements to VTS feature enhancement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966050","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvements to VTS feature enhancement","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059912S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288963,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Weninger","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Weninger","id":"37712670500"},{"name":"Martin W\u00f6llmer","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"W\u00f6llmer","id":"37542055400"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Geiger","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Geiger","id":"37994461500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Schuller","affiliation":["Institute for Human-Machine Communication, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37283946000"},{"name":"Jort F.

First, the noisy feature vectors are compensated by using a novel MD imputation technique based on the integration of truncated Gaussian pdfs. Although the proposed MD estimator has both the advantages of MD techniques and the use of cepstral features, it may still be affected by a number of uncertainty sources. In order to deal with these uncertainties, WVA-based uncertainty decoding is proposed. Our experiments on the Aurora-2 and Aurora-4 tasks show that the proposed MD estimator outperforms other MD imputation techniques. Also, we show that the combination of MD imputation with WVA provides better results than the combination with other uncertainty processing techniques such as the use of evidence pdfs for the estimated features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966054","htmlLink":"/document/6288966/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combining missing-data reconstruction and uncertainty decoding for robust speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining missing-data reconstruction and uncertainty decoding for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064088S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6288977,"authors":[{"name":"Weibin Zhang","affiliation":["HKUST Human Language Technology Center, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Weibin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469782000"},{"name":"Pascale Fung","affiliation":["HKUST Human Language Technology Center, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pascale","lastName":"Fung","id":"37276275200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6288977","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"Full covariance acoustic models trained with limited training data generalize poorly to unseen test data due to a large number of free parameters. We propose to use sparse inverse covariance matrices to address this problem. Previous sparse inverse covariance methods never outperformed full covariance methods. We propose a method to automatically drive the structure of inverse covariance matrices to sparse during training. We use a new objective function by adding L1 regularization to the traditional objective function for maximum likelihood estimation. The graphic lasso method for the estimation of a sparse inverse covariance matrix is incorporated into the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn parameters of HMM using the new objective function. Experimental results show that we only need about 25% of the parameters of the inverse covariance matrices to be nonzero in order to achieve the same performance of a full covariance system. Our proposed system using sparse inverse covariance Gaussians also significantly outperforms a system using full covariance Gaussians trained on limited data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Hidden Markov models","Training data","Linear programming","Sparse matrices","Training","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","covariance matrices","expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix inversion","sparse matrices","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low resource speech recognition","automatically learned sparse inverse covariance matrices","training data","full covariance acoustic models","objective function","L1 regularization","maximum likelihood estimation","graphic lasso method","expectation maximization algorithm","HMM parameter learning","sparse inverse covariance Gaussians"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse inverse covariance matrix","speech recognition","graphic lasso","expectation maximization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288977","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06288977.pdf","startPage":"4737","endPage":"4740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowresource speech recognition with automatically learned sparse inverse covariance matrices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6288977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lowresource speech recognition with automatically learned sparse inverse covariance matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6288977/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6288977/","accessionNumber":"12966065","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowresource speech recognition with automatically learned sparse inverse covariance matrices","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038734S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6288977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6288989,"authors":[{"name":"Haris B.

Results on the PASCAL-CHiME task for this algorithms show that they consistently outperform conventional beamfomers with a minimal increase in computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966107","htmlLink":"/document/6289020/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integration of beamforming and automatic speech recognition through propagation of the wiener posterior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of beamforming and automatic speech recognition through propagation of the wiener posterior","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066901S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6289031,"authors":[{"name":"Dilek Hakkani-T\u00fcr","affiliation":["Speech Laboratories, Microsoft, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dilek","lastName":"Hakkani-T\u00fcr","id":"38270094800"},{"name":"Gokhan Tur","affiliation":["Speech Laboratories, Microsoft, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Tur","id":"37284311400"},{"name":"Rukmini Iyer","affiliation":["Speech Laboratories, Microsoft, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rukmini","lastName":"Iyer","id":"37273060200"},{"name":"Larry Heck","affiliation":["Speech Laboratories, Microsoft, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Heck","id":"38275102700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289031","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Feature extraction","Keyword search","Search engines","Web search","Syntactics","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","language translation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language utterances","search queries","SLU domain detection","query click logs","search engine","Bing","Google","valuable implicit feedback","statistical spoken language understanding","SLU models","machine translation approach","URLs","syntactic transformations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["domain detection","spoken language understanding","search query click logs","machine translation"]}],"abstract":"Logs of user queries from a search engine (such as Bing or Google) together with the links clicked provide valuable implicit feedback to improve statistical spoken language understanding (SLU) models. However, the form of natural language utterances occurring in spoken interactions with a computer differs stylistically from that of keyword search queries. In this paper, we propose a machine translation approach to learn a mapping from natural language utterances to search queries. We train statistical translation models, using task and domain independent semantically equivalent natural language and keyword search query pairs mined from the search query click logs. We then extend our previous work on enriching the existing classification feature sets for input utterance domain detection with features computed using the click distribution over a set of clicked URLs from search engine query click logs of user utterances with automatically translated queries. This approach results in significant improvements for domain detection, especially when detecting the domains of user utterances that are formulated as natural language queries and effectively complements to the earlier work using syntactic transformations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289031","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289031","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289031.pdf","startPage":"4953","endPage":"4956","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Translating natural language utterances to search queries for SLU domain detection using query click logs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Translating natural language utterances to search queries for SLU domain detection using query click logs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966118","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Translating natural language utterances to search queries for SLU domain detection using query click logs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0004953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061447S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6289041,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The development of voice search for these languages led to a significant simplification of the original process to build a system for any new language which in in parts became our default process for internationalization of voice search.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289079","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289079.pdf","startPage":"5149","endPage":"5152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Japanese and Korean voice search","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289079/","displayDocTitle":"Japanese and Korean voice search","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966166","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289079/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Japanese and Korean voice search","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034036S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6289081,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Haipeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240076500"},{"name":"Cheung-Chi Leung","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Cheung-Chi","lastName":"Leung","id":"37675274400"},{"name":"Tan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277269500"},{"name":"Bin Ma","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37400228200"},{"name":"Haizhou Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Haizhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37407157000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289081","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":443},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289081","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Speech","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Training data","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","query processing","speech recognition","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic segment modeling approach","query-by-example spoken term detection","posteriorgram-based template matching framework","STD","frame-level posteriorgrams","dynamic time warping","acoustic segment models","unsupervised iterative procedure","ASM tokenizer","fisher corpus","language-mismatched phoneme recognizer","GMM tokenizer","unsupervised speaker normalization techniques","test utterances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spoken term detection","query-by-example","acoustic segment model","posteriorgram-based template matching"]}],"abstract":"The framework of posteriorgram-based template matching has been shown to be successful for query-by-example spoken term detection (STD). This framework employs a tokenizer to convert query examples and test utterances into frame-level posteriorgrams, and applies dynamic time warping to match the query posteriorgrams with test posteriorgrams to locate possible occurrences of the query term. It is not trivial to design a reliable tokenizer due to heterogeneous test conditions and the limitation of training resources. This paper presents a study of using acoustic segment models (ASMs) as the tokenizer. ASMs can be obtained following an unsupervised iterative procedure without any training transcriptions. The STD performance of the ASM tokenizer is evaluated on Fisher Corpus with comparison to three alternative tokenizers. Experimental results show that the ASM tokenizer outperforms a conventional GMM tokenizer and a language-mismatched phoneme recognizer. In addition, the performance is significantly improved by applying unsupervised speaker normalization techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289081","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289081.pdf","startPage":"5157","endPage":"5160","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An acoustic segment modeling approach to query-by-example spoken term detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"An acoustic segment modeling approach to query-by-example spoken term detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289081/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966168","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289081/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An acoustic segment modeling approach to query-by-example spoken term detection","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050484S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6289082,"authors":[{"name":"Yaodong Zhang","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37634327300"},{"name":"Ruslan Salakhutdinov","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ruslan","lastName":"Salakhutdinov","id":"37427069100"},{"name":"Hung-An Chang","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hung-An","lastName":"Chang","id":"37068303100"},{"name":"James Glass","affiliation":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Glass","id":"37284185800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289082","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech","Vectors","Speech recognition","Data models","Probability","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","query processing","speech recognition","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource configurable spoken query detection","deep Boltzmann machines","DBM-based posteriorgrams","semisupervised training","unsupervised training","keyword spotting tasks","TIMIT speech corpus","labeled data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spoken query detection","posteriorgram","Deep Boltzmann Machines"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a spoken query detection method based on posteriorgrams generated from Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs).

For this specific case, we design a new ordering algorithm which provides very large savings for some example MIMO radar systems considered for almost all false alarm probabilities and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). While these savings are demonstrated numerically, we also prove analytically that savings of (N - 1)/N \u00d7 100% are achieved for sufficiently small or large false alarm probabilities and sufficiently large distance measures, a generalization of SNR, for a very large class of signal detection problems which employ N total sensors.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289089","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289089.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"5189","endPage":"5192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordering for energy efficient communications for noncoherent MIMO radar networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ordering for energy efficient communications for noncoherent MIMO radar networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289089/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966176","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289089/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordering for energy efficient communications for noncoherent MIMO radar networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053331S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6289092,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Aittom\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, SMARAD CoE, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Aittom\u00e4ki","id":"37391626000"},{"name":"Visa Koivunen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, SMARAD CoE, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"firstName":"Visa","lastName":"Koivunen","id":"37269798700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289092","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","MIMO radar","Maximum likelihood estimation","Vectors","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO radar","radar transmitters","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target velocity estimation","distributed MIMO radar","multiple pulse repetition frequency","distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar","PRF","radar transmitter","maximum likelihood estimator","white noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","Maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose estimating the velocity of a target using a widely distributed multiple-input multiple-output radar that employs multiple pulse repetition frequencies.

The protocol includes a measurement epoch, feedback from the intended receiver to the transmit nodes, and a beamforming epoch. The intended receiver tracks the clock and kinematic parameters of the independent transmit nodes and coordinates the transmit nodes by feeding back state predictions which are then used as phase corrections to facilitate passband phase and frequency alignment at the receiver. A three-state dynamic model is developed to describe the stochastic kinematics and clock evolution of each transmit node relative to the frame of the receiver/coordinator. Steady-state analysis techniques are used to analytically predict the tracking performance as well as the beamforming gain as a function of the system parameters.

The simplest technique in this class is a 1-bit RSS feedback algorithm that has been studied in detail in the literature. Under this 1-bit algorithm, transmitters make random phase perturbations and the receiver periodically sends 1 bit of feedback indicating whether the received signal strength has increased or not compared to what was observed in the past. While this simple algorithm has very attractive properties such as dynamic tracking of time-varying phases, robustness to noise and other disturbances and is also simple to implement, we show in this paper that it also has serious limitations such as slow convergence and poor tracking performance in the presence of frequency offsets between the transmitters. We then show that enhanced feedback algorithms where the receiver sends as feedback several bits of feedback indicating the amplitude and phase of the received signal over time, are able to achieve beamforming in the presence of frequency offsets and large feedback channel latencies, while retaining the scalability and robustness of the 1-bit algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"5213","endPage":"5216","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable feedback algorithms for distributed transmit beamforming in wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289095/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable feedback algorithms for distributed transmit beamforming in wireless networks","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966182","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable feedback algorithms for distributed transmit beamforming in wireless networks","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077421S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6289096,"authors":[{"name":"Troy Stevens","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Troy","lastName":"Stevens","id":"38469769400"},{"name":"Keith Kastella","affiliation":["SRI International, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Kastella","id":"37064817500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289096","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Clocks","Synchronization","Receivers","Measurement uncertainty","Global Positioning System","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","clocks","Global Positioning System","Kalman filters","mobile radio","radiotelemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network localization","reference-aided method","open-loop method","mobile radio network","distributed transmit beamforming","independent clock synchronization","position estimation","relative angular orientation estimation","steering direction constellation","transmission time stamp transmission","reception time stamp transmission","round-robin fashion","clock offset estimation","Interradio range estimation","GPS measurement","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed transmit beamforming","ad-hoc communications network","wireless communications","self-localization and synchronization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289096","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289096","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstract":"This paper describes open-loop and reference-aided methods to localize and synchronize a network of mobile radios to perform distributed transmit beamforming.

The informed-transmitter link assumes that the distributed transmit nodes have access to channel state information. The channel state information includes the channel between the transmit and receive antenna arrays and a statistical model for interference impinging upon the receive array. In principle, the channel will have resolvable delay spread. In addition, because the distributed sets of nodes do not have a common local oscillator and move independently, the receiving set of nodes may observe resolvable independent frequency offsets and frequency spread from each of the transmit nodes. To compensate for this doubly dispersive channel, a space-time-frequency channel estimate is constructed.

Our algorithm essentially follows the logic of the Weiss-Weinstein bound, and has the following stages: coarse estimation using time domain samples, fine-grained estimation using a Newton algorithm in the frequency domain, and final refinement to within a small fraction of a carrier cycle. While the results here are of fundamental interest, we are motivated to push the limits of synchronization to enable the tight coordination required for emulating virtual antenna arrays using a collection of cooperating nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","accessionNumber":"12966186","htmlLink":"/document/6289099/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Attaining fundamental bounds on timing synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attaining fundamental bounds on timing synchronization","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045684S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6289104,"authors":[{"name":"Avishy Y.

Relying exclusively on the UKF formulation, our method facilitates sequential processing of measurements by employing the familiar Kalman filter predictor corrector form. As distinct from other CS methods, and by virtue of its pseudo-measurement mechanism, the CS-UKF, as we termed it, is non iterative, thereby maintaining a computational overhead which is nearly equal to that of the conventional UKF.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289104.pdf","startPage":"5249","endPage":"5252","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unscented compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Standards","Compressed sensing","Approximation methods","Optimization","Bayesian methods","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Kalman filters","measurement systems","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unscented compressed sensing","CS algorithm","noisy observations","time-varying signal","unscented Kalman filter","peripheral optimization","underlying signal support","sequential processing","Kalman filter predictor corrector form","pseudomeasurement mechanism","CS-UKF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Kalman filter","Unscented Kalman Filter","Sparse signal recovery","Sigma point filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Unscented compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289104/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966191","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unscented compressed sensing","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054124S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6289109,"authors":[{"name":"Ramin Zahedi","affiliation":["ECE Department, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Ramin","lastName":"Zahedi","id":"37545463000"},{"name":"Lucas W.

The structure of the optimal controller under various asymptotic regimes is studied. First, a setup with a fixed sample size is considered. In this setup, the asymptotic quantity of interest is the optimal exponent for the maximal error probability. For the case of binary hypothesis testing, it is shown that the optimal error exponent corresponds to the maximum Chernoff information over the choice of controls. It is also shown that a pure stationary control policy, i.e., a fixed policy which does not depend on specific realizations of past measurements and past controls (open-loop), is asymptotically optimal even among the class of all causal control policies. We also derive lower and upper bounds for the optimal error exponent for the case of multiple hypothesis testing. Second, a sequential setup is considered wherein the controller can also decide when to stop taking observations. In this case, the objective is to minimize the expected stopping time subject to the constraints of vanishing error probabilities under each hypothesis. A sequential test is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses and is shown to be asymptotically optimal.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289111","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289111.pdf","startPage":"5277","endPage":"5280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlled sensing for hypothesis testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289111/","displayDocTitle":"Controlled sensing for hypothesis testing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966198","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289111/","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlled sensing for hypothesis testing","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079779S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6289112,"authors":[{"name":"Rajan Narasimha","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Rajan","lastName":"Narasimha","id":"37392632600"},{"name":"Georg Zeitler","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Zeitler","id":"37392227600"},{"name":"Naresh Shanbhag","affiliation":["Department Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Shanbhag","id":"37273973400"},{"name":"Andrew C.

Although platform non-idealities have always posed a fundamental limitation, the overheads of conventional margining are now reaching intolerable levels. We describe an alternate approach to hardware resilience that applies to applications where advanced modeling and inference capabilities are required, a rapidly increasing emphasis in many applications. We show how a data-driven modeling framework for analyzing application data can also be used to effectively model and overcome a broad range of hardware non-idealities. Specific examples for biomedical sensors are shown that are able to retain performance with minimal on-line overhead despite the presence of severe digital- and analog-circuit non-idealities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling system-level platform resilience through embedded data-driven inference capabilities in electronic devices","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289113","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289113.pdf","startPage":"5285","endPage":"5288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Enabling system-level platform resilience through embedded data-driven inference capabilities in electronic devices","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289113/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966200","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling system-level platform resilience through embedded data-driven inference capabilities in electronic devices","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076558S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6289116,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Shi","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Shi","id":"38469706400"},{"name":"Arthur Redfern","affiliation":["Systems and Applications Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Redfern","id":"37330564700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0046-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0044-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-190X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"6289116","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Clocks","Linearity","Switches","Nonlinear distortion","Estimation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","error compensation","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instant error sampling","track-and-hold circuit","ADC","TH circuits","high-speed high-resolution analog-to-digital converters","high input signal frequency","mathematical models","MOS technology","bipolar technology","nonlinear behavior","digital post compensation method","energy-free method","background calibration configuration","nonlinear TH model","spurious free dynamic range","SFDR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","track-and-hold (TH)","nonlinear","sampling instant error","digital compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289116","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289116.pdf","startPage":"5297","endPage":"5300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital compensation of sampling instant errors in the track-and-hold portion of an ADC","abstract":"Track-and-hold (TH) circuits in the front end of high-speed high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) typically limit ADC performance at high input signal frequencies.

A digital post compensation method is then presented with it's coefficients estimated using an energy-free method in a background calibration configuration.

In applications where signal frequencies are high, but information bandwidths are low, AICs have been proposed as a potential solution to overcome the resolution and performance limitations of sampling jitter in high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Although the AIC architecture facilitates slower ADCs, the signal encoding, typically realized with a mixer-like circuit, still occurs at the Nyquist frequency of the input to avoid aliasing. We show that the jitter of this mixing stage limits the achievable AIC resolution. In this work, the end-to-end system evaluation framework is designed to analyze these limitations as well as the relative energy-efficiency of AICs versus ADCs across the resolution, receiver gain and signal sparsity. The evaluation shows that AICs improve the resolution by 1 bit when the signal of interest is very sparse, and enable 2\u00d7 in energy savings when no pre-amplification is required.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289119","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289119.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289119","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","startPage":"5309","endPage":"5312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance trade-offs and design limitations of analog-to-information converter front-ends","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","displayDocTitle":"Performance trade-offs and design limitations of analog-to-information converter front-ends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289119/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966206","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance trade-offs and design limitations of analog-to-information converter front-ends","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064307S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6289121,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan I.

Our goal is to learn the analysis dictionary from a set of signal examples, and the approach taken is parallel and similar to the one adopted by the K-SVD algorithm that serves the corresponding problem in the synthesis model. We present the development of the algorithm steps, which include two greedy tailored pursuit algorithms and a penalty function for the dictionary update stage. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments, showing a successful and meaningful recovery of the analysis dictionary.","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289143","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6268628/6287775/06289143.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287775","startPage":"5405","endPage":"5408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-SVD dictionary-learning for the analysis sparse model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"K-SVD dictionary-learning for the analysis sparse model","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 March 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289143/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-30 March 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12966230","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289143/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-SVD dictionary-learning for the analysis sparse model","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"0005405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07506S","chronDate":"25-30 March 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6268628","isNumber":"6287775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6268628","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6287775","articleId":"6289143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289144,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Yaghoobi","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications (IDCom), University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Yaghoobi","id":"37572891800"},{"name":"Sangnam Nam","affiliation":["Centre Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Sangnam","lastName":"Nam","id":"37711298800"},{"name":"R\u00e9mi Gribonval","affiliation":["Centre Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Gribonval","id":"37408920000"},{"name":"Mike E.

However, naive femtocell deployments can cause pilot pollution and raise interference levels for users connected to macrocells, particularly when the local density of femtocells is very high, such as in an enterprise setting. We describe three dynamic femtocell pilot adjustment algorithms that balance femtocell coverage and interference: a distributed and two cooperative algorithms that leverage a lightweight, local, interference management server. Using simulations, we find that the interference management algorithms reduce outage probabilities relative to a naive interference management scheme by up to 85%. Exploiting locality through the use of dynamic interference management algorithms is a promising approach to managing femtocell deployments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6287204/6289167/06289194.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Interference Management in Femtocells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Heuristic algorithms","Macrocell networks","Servers","Computer architecture","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic interference management","customer-deployed cellular base stations","wireless networks","dynamic femtocell pilot adjustment algorithms","balance femtocell coverage","cooperative algorithms","interference management server"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Interference Management in Femtocells","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289194/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965288","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Interference Management in Femtocells","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1136766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059753S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6289196,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Al-Rawi","affiliation":["Ericsson Nomadic Laboratory, Jorvas, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Rawi","id":"37089127828"},{"name":"Jorg Huschke","affiliation":["Ericsson Euro Laboratory, Herzogenrath, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Huschke","id":"37294448500"},{"name":"Magued Sedra","affiliation":["Ericsson Euro Laboratory, Herzogenrath, Germany"],"firstName":"Magued","lastName":"Sedra","id":"38469352500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1544-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1543-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1542-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6289196","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":495},"abstract":"The protected-subframe (PSF) structure is one of the methods for downlink inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) utilized in heterogenous networks and is featured in Rel-10 of the technical specification for 3GPP's E-UTRAN.

Most fingerprinting-based systems so far rely on the received signal strength (RSS), which can be easily measured at the receiver with commercial WLAN equipment. However, RSS is a coarse value which simply measures the received power for a whole channel. Thus, it fluctuates over time in typical indoor environments with rich multipath effects and not unique for a specific location. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Fine-grained Indoor Fingerprinting System (FIFS). FIFS explores a PHYlayer Channel State Information (CSI) that specifies the channel status over all the subcarriers for location fingerprinting in WLAN. The system leverages the CSI values including different amplitudes and phases at multiple propagation paths, known as the frequency diversity, to uniquely manifest a location. Moreover, the multiple antennas provides the spatial diversity that can be further augmented in fingerprinting. We also present a coherence bandwidth-enhanced probability algorithm with a correlation filter to map object to the fingerprints. We conducted experiments in two typical indoor scenarios with commercial IEEE 802.11 NICs.

These methods, however, have two drawbacks: (i) they are not efficient since they use complex regular expressions as protocol signatures, and (ii) they require manual intervention to generate and maintain signatures, partly due to the signature complexity. In this paper, we present CUTE, an automatic traffic classification method, which relies on sets of weighted terms as protocol signatures. The key idea behind CUTE is an observation that, given appropriate weights, the occurrence of a specific term is more important than the relative location of terms in a flow. This observation is based on experimental evaluations as well as theoretical analysis, and leads to several key advantages over previous classification techniques: (i) CUTE is extremely faster than other classification schemes since matching flows with weighed terms is significantly faster than matching regular expressions; (ii) CUTE can classify network traffic using only the first few bytes of the flows in most cases; and (iii) Unlike most existing classification techniques, CUTE can be used to classify partial (or even slightly modified) flows. Even though CUTE replaces complex regular expressions with a set of simple terms, using theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations (based on two large packet traces from tier-one ISPs), we show that its accuracy is as good as or better than existing complex classification schemes, i.e. CUTE achieves precision and recall rates of more than 90%. Additionally, CUTE can successfully classify more than half of flows that other DPI methods fail to classify.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289207/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965301","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CUTE: Traffic Classification Using TErms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUTE: Traffic Classification Using TErms","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1136918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080057S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6289218,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Abdul-Rahman","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science & Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Abdul-Rahman","id":"38270499200"},{"name":"Masaharu Munetomo","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaharu","lastName":"Munetomo","id":"37330250200"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Akama","affiliation":["Information Initiative Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Akama","id":"37293787700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1544-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1543-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1542-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6289218","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289218","abstract":"Resource management in cloud platforms becomes an increasingly complex and daunting task surrounded by various challenges of stringent QoS requirements, service availability guaranteeing and escalating overhead of the infrastructure that resulted from operation costs and ecological impact. On the other hand, virtualization adds a greater flexibility to the resource managers in addressing such challenges.

Recently, we have proposed a resource management model for cloud platforms, which utilizes a new resource mapping formulation and relays on a hybrid virtualization framework in an attempt to realize a resource manager that intelligently adapts the available cloud resources to satisfy the conflicting objectives of the running applications and underlying infrastructures' requirements. Moreover, we have proposed state of the art Binary-Real coded Genetic Algorithm (BRGA), which has been applied successfully to a wide spectrum of global and constrained optimization problems from the known benchmark suites. In this paper, we aim to proceed by proposing a mathematical model and a modified version of BRGA to validate our model. In addition, we aim to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and scalability of our approach through simulation

Spectrum Handoff with a Delay Requirement in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In Cognitive Radio Networks, secondary users are required to handoff from a wireless channel to another in order to cope with the dynamic spectrum environment imposed by primary users activity. Spectrum handoff may cause service interruptions or significant delays leading to the degradation of the quality of transmission. In this paper, we propose and study a novel spectrum handoff strategy aiming at reducing the unnecessary handoff operations while considering a delay bound requirement. First, the expected delay of application packets is computed as a function of the queue associated with a channel. This delay reflects the status of the channel and its usability for transmitting packets. Second, and in order to prevent the unnecessary handoffs, we use the expected delays to estimate a delay violation ratio that guides the spectrum handoff and selection decisions. Besides, we study the utility of using additional backup channels at the time of handoff to alleviate the problem of fast successive handoffs. We show through simulations that our strategy controls better the tradeoff between channel handoffs and achieving the delay requirement compared to random handoff and low channel occupancy handoff.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289234/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12965328","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289234/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Controlling Spectrum Handoff with a Delay Requirement in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling Spectrum Handoff with a Delay Requirement in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1137320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062198S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6289247,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Salhi","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Emna","lastName":"Salhi","id":"37393116000"},{"name":"Samer Lahoud","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Lahoud","id":"37562978000"},{"name":"Bernard Cousin","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Cousin","id":"37282296400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1544-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1543-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1542-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6289247","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Delay","Probes","Joining processes","Educational institutions","Minimization","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer network management","facility location","integer programming","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single link-level network anomaly localization","computer networks","link pair","anomaly detection solution","localization overhead","localization cost","localization delay","integer linear program","ILP","NP-hard facility location problem","polynomial-time reduction"]}],"abstract":"Achieving accurate, cost-efficient, and fast anomaly localization is a highly desired feature in computer networks. Prior works, examining the problem of single link-level anomaly localization, have claimed that a necessary condition for localizing anomalies unambiguously is to deploy resources that enable the monitoring of a set of paths distinguishing between all links of the network pairwise. In this paper, we show that the number of pair of links that are to be distinguished can be cut down drastically using an already established anomaly detection solution. This results in reducing the localization overhead and cost significantly. Furthermore, we show that all potential anomaly scenarios can be derived offline from the anomaly detection solution. Therefore, we compute full localization solutions, i.e. monitors that are to be activated and paths that are to be monitored, for all potential anomaly scenarios offline. This results in a significant minimization of the localization delay. We devise an anomaly localization technique that selects monitor locations and monitoring paths jointly; thereby enabling a trade-off between the number and locations of monitoring devices and the quality of monitoring paths. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP), and is shown to be NP-hard through a polynomial-time reduction from the NP-hard facility location problem. The effectiveness and the correctness of the proposed anomaly localization scheme are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289247","publicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6287204/6289167/06289247.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of Single Link-Level Network Anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289247/","displayDocTitle":"Localization of Single Link-Level Network Anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965341","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289247/","conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of Single Link-Level Network Anomalies","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1137422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063953S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6289283,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279507400"},{"name":"Youhua Zhou","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Youhua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38469772500"},{"name":"Xiaowen Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Chu","id":"37271636500"},{"name":"Yiu-Wing Leung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yiu-Wing","lastName":"Leung","id":"37271603500"},{"name":"Zhifeng Hao","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Hao","id":"38469402500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1544-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1543-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1542-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6289283","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Interference","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Cognitive radio","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","failure analysis","fault tolerance","telecommunication network topology","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized-biconnectivity","fault tolerant cognitive radio networks","fault tolerant topologies","wireless networks","CRN","cognitive users","primary users","node-link failure","g-bi-connected network","two-stage approach","channel assignment stage","degree-control process","maximum transmission power","distributed topology recovery algorithms","node-join","node-leave","performance evaluation"]}],"abstract":"Bi-connectivity is a basic requirement for designing fault tolerant topologies in wireless networks. In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), available channels of cognitive users dynamically change since a channel becomes unavailable whenever the channel is reclaimed by primary users. Therefore, fault tolerance of CRNs highly depends on the status of channel availability. However, traditional definition of bi-connectivity concerns only node/link failure and thus is not suitable to CRNs. In this study, we introduce a new definition of generalized-bi-connectivity (g-bi-connectivity) where a CRN is said to be g-bi-connected if the remaining network is still connected when any one of the two events occurs: i) any node fails; ii) any channel becomes unavailable. Based on this definition, our problem is to build a g-bi-connected network by assigning power and channels to the cognitive users. Our objective is to minimize the maximum transmission power of users and the number of channels required. We propose a two-stage approach which consists of the power assignment stage and the channel assignment stage. In the power assignment, we integrate a novel degree-control process which prepares a good topology for minimizing the number of channels in the next stage. We prove that the maximum transmission power of cognitive users is optimized and derive an upper- bound on the number of channels required. We present distributed topology recovery algorithms which give guaranteed g-bi-connectivity in case of node-join and node-leave.

In this paper, we provide a model that approximates the hit-ratios of any multi-cache topology for the Least Recently/Frequently Used (LRFU) caching policies, which consist of a spectrum of policies based on a trade-off between recency and frequency. We also present a way to approximate the performances of the network of caches when the input traffic changes. The approximation results can be used to decide suitable policy for CR at different positions in the network topology. With appropriate policy for each single CR, we are able to improve the performance of the whole in-network caching system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289289","publicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6287204/6289167/06289289.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caching Policies for In-Network Caching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289289/","displayDocTitle":"Caching Policies for In-Network Caching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965383","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289289/","conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching Policies for In-Network Caching","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1137578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055064S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289298,"authors":[{"name":"Javier J.

Thus, collecting such audio data, while maximizing the network lifetime, is a key challenge for WSNs. In this work, we propose a methodology that applies Compressive Sensing (CS) aiming at collecting as little data as possible to allow the signal reconstruction, so that the reconstructed signal is still representative. The key issue is to determine a sparse base that best represents the audio information used for identifying the target species. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on anuran (frogs and toads) calls, but the methodology can be applied for other animal families and species. The reason for that choice is that long-term anuran monitoring has been used by biologists as an early indicator for ecological stress. By using real wild anuran calls, we show that 98% classification rate can be achieved by using as little as 10% of the original data. We also use simulation to evaluate the impact of our solution on the network performance (energy consumption, delivery rate, and network delay).","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289298","publicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6287204/6289167/06289298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289167","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Sensing for Efficiently Collecting Wildlife Sounds with Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Sensing for Efficiently Collecting Wildlife Sounds with Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965392","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Sensing for Efficiently Collecting Wildlife Sounds with Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1137604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070617S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6289311,"authors":[{"name":"Selvi Kadirvel","affiliation":["Advanced Computing and Information Systems Laboratory, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Selvi","lastName":"Kadirvel","id":"37860634900"},{"name":"Jose A.

The ability to estimate Map-reduce application performance is critical for efficient resource scheduling and provisioning both on dedicated clusters and on the cloud.

In this paper, we make the case for performance prediction using regression techniques based on machine-learning. Through modeling the Map-Reduce environment as a grey-box, we can leverage a combination of externally observed system features and information about sub-system internals. We identify four learning techniques with high prediction accuracy through a detailed comparative study of twenty methods. The powerful capabilities of data analytics platforms are usually accompanied by frequent faults that occur due to scale, complexity and the use of commercial off- the-shelf components. We show that our proposed approach can effectively predict degraded performance under these faulty conditions by the inclusion of additional fault-related input features.

We first analyze the method of general time synchronization algorithm in OFDM systems. The analysis will show that the calculated time value for synchronization is unstable and inadequate. This instability of synchronization time value is generated by the variation of multipath channel in which max power path is changed with time. We show how proposed algorithm reduces the instability of synchronization time. Results of simulation show that proposed algorithm reduces the instability of synchronization time and improve time tracking performance considerably. Consequently demodulation performance is also enhanced and overall communication system can operate more efficiently. Because proposed timing synchronization algorithm decides synchronization time considering channel characteristics, controlled synchronization time is extremely stable. Especially, 16-QAM and 64-QAM modulation schemes for high data rate transmission is more sensitive to timing error, therefore proposed time synchronization algorithm supports to keep high data rate system performance stable.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289317","publicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6287204/6289167/06289317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289167","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Time Synchronization for OFDM Systems on Mobile Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Practical Time Synchronization for OFDM Systems on Mobile Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289317/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-2 Aug. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965411","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289317/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Time Synchronization for OFDM Systems on Mobile Channel","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"pid1138428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043045S","chronDate":"July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6287204","isNumber":"6289167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6287204","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6289167","articleId":"6289317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6289332,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Calabretta","affiliation":["Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/6308750/6289332/6289332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Calabretta (M'01) received the Ph.D. degree from the Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 2004.","In 1995, he visited the RAI Research Center, Turin, Italy.

This allows for implementing an optical packet switching architecture that scales to a large port count without compromising the latency. As a proof of concept, we have employed an FPGA board with 100 MHz clock to validate the operation of the label processor in a 160 Gb/s optical packet switching system. Experimental results show successful three label bits processing and 160 Gb/s packets switching with 1 dB power penalty and 470 ns of latency. Projections on the label processor performance by using more powerful FPGAs indicate that 60 label bits ( optical addresses) can be processed within 31 ns.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2012.2215840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2012.2215840","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6308750/06289332.pdf","startPage":"3173","endPage":"3181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2012","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Label Processor for Low Latency and Large Port Count Optical Packet Switches","volume":"30","issue":"19","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13014661","htmlLink":"/document/6289332/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2012","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Label Processor for Low Latency and Large Port Count Optical Packet Switches","sourcePdf":"jlt-calabretta-2215840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081204S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6308750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6308750","articleId":"6289332","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6289337,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Yu","id":"38489963900"},{"name":"Costas D.

This model is able to handle arbitrarily-sized vocabularies, hence dispensing with the need for shortlists that are commonly used in NNLMs. Several softmax layers replace the standard output layer in this model. The output structure depends on the word clustering which is based on the continuous word representation determined by the NNLM. Mandarin and Arabic data are used to evaluate the SOUL NNLM accuracy via speech-to-text experiments. Well tuned speech-to-text systems (with error rates around 10%) serve as the baselines. The SOUL model achieves consistent improvements over a classical shortlist NNLM both in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy for these two languages that are quite different in terms of their internal structure and recognition vocabulary size. An enhanced training scheme is proposed that allows more data to be used at each training iteration of the neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13090733","htmlLink":"/document/6289355/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Structured Output Layer Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Output Layer Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-oparin-2215599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10058S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6334458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6334458","articleId":"6289355","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6289357,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Sturmel","affiliation":["Institut Langevin, CNRS UMR 7587, Paris Diderot University and ESPCI ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6334458/6289357/6289357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Sturmel (M'08) studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan.

Specialty polymer capacitor which is mostly used as output capacitor for such a consideration although it limits the performance of converter. On the other hand, the multilayer ceramic capacitors are widely used in commercial power management ICs due to the advantages of low cost and ESR. However, the stability often confronts with the subharmonic problem caused by small time constant. A differential-zero compensator with the noise margin enhancement (DZC-NME) technique in constant on-time control buck dc-dc converter with output ceramic capacitor is proposed in this paper. Thus, the proposed DZC-NME technique not only eliminates the limit of large time constant but also tolerates the existence of equivalent series inductor (ESL) effect. Experiment results demonstrate small output ripple of 10 mV and high efficiency of 91% when ESR is smaller than 1 m\u03a9 and large interference from ESL effect is 40 mV.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6361328/06289370.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Equivalent Series Inductor Effect in Delay-Ripple Reshaped Constant On-Time Control for Buck Converter With Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Inductors","Stability criteria","Thermal stability","Switching frequency","Ceramics","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ceramic capacitors","DC-DC power convertors","inductors","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent series inductor effect","delay-ripple reshaped constant on-time control","buck converter","multilayer ceramic capacitors","time constant","output capacitor","equivalent series resistance","ESR","polymer capacitor","commercial power management IC","subharmonic problem","differential-zero compensator-noise margin enhancement technique","DZC-NME technique","constant on-time control buck dc-dc converter stability","equivalent series inductor effect","ESL effect","voltage 10 mV","efficiency 91 percent","voltage 40 mV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant on-time control for buck converter","equivalent series inductor (ESL)","multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC)","power management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Equivalent Series Inductor Effect in Delay-Ripple Reshaped Constant On-Time Control for Buck Converter With Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors","volume":"28","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6289370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146883","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Equivalent Series Inductor Effect in Delay-Ripple Reshaped Constant On-Time Control for Buck Converter With Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2215886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07663S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6289370","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6289371,"authors":[{"name":"Karsten Fink","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6361328/6289371/6289371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Steffen Bernet received the Dipl. degree form Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree from Ilmenau University of Technology, in 1995, both in electrical engineering.","During 1995 and 1996, he worked as Postdoc in the ECE Department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

Most of the work has concentrated on the optimization of the link efficiency and has not taken into account the efficiency of the driver. Class-E amplifiers have been identified as ideal drivers for IPT applications, but their power handling capability at tens of megahertz has been a crucial limiting factor, since the load and inductor characteristics are set by the requirements of the resonant inductive system. The frequency limitation of the driver restricts the unloaded Q-factor of the coils and thus the link efficiency. With a suitable driver, copper coil unloaded Q factors of over 1000 can be achieved in the low megahertz region, enabling a cost-effective high Q coil assembly. The system presented in this paper alleviates the use of heavy and expensive field-shaping techniques by presenting an efficient IPT system capable of transmitting energy with a dc-to-load efficiency above 77% at 6 MHz across a distance of 30 cm. To the authors knowledge, this is the highest dc-to-load efficiency achieved for an IPT system without introducing restrictive coupling factor enhancement techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2012.2215887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6361328/06289372.pdf","startPage":"2437","endPage":"2447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing DC-to-Load Efficiency for Inductive Power Transfer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing DC-to-Load Efficiency for Inductive Power Transfer","volume":"28","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289372/","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13146885","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289372/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing DC-to-Load Efficiency for Inductive Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tpel-pinuela-2215887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093492S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6361328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"6361328","articleId":"6289372","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6289379,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Hyun Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Hyun","lastName":"Park","id":"38510367600"},{"name":"Dong-Hoon Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Hoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"38183014300"},{"name":"Kyungho Ryu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungho","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37592197400"},{"name":"Seong-Ook Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Ook","lastName":"Jung","id":"37983982700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6289379","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1086},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"In this brief, we propose an all-digital delay locked loop (ADDLL) for a clock-deskew buffer. A low static phase offset at a high operating frequency is achieved by adopting a high-resolution window phase detector (PD) and a tristate-inverter-based ladder type coarse delay line (CDL). The proposed PD generates a high-resolution detection window that is adaptive to the process-voltage-temperature variation and reduces the static phase offset to nearly half of the fine delay line (FDL) resolution using a dual-output FDL. A proposed CDL is adopted in order to attain a small coarse delay step using tristate-inverters. The proposed ADDLL is designed using 0.13- \u03bcm process technology with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The operating frequency range is 700 MHz to 2.0 GHz.

In order to scale data rates over band-limited channels, various types of equalization circuitry are used to compensate for frequency-dependent loss. However, this additional complexity introduces power and area costs, requiring selection of an appropriate I/O equalization architecture in order to comply with system power budgets. This paper presents a design flow for power optimization of high-speed electrical links at a given data rate, channel type, and process technology node, which couples statistical link analysis techniques with circuit power estimates based on normalized transistor parameters extracted with a constant current density methodology. The design framework selects the optimum equalization architecture, circuit logic style (CMOS versus current-mode logic), and transmit output swing for minimum I/O power. Analysis shows that low loss channel characteristics and minimal circuit complexity, together with scaling of transmitter output swing allows excellent power efficiency at high data rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6565423/06289381.pdf","startPage":"1421","endPage":"1431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2211628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2211628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565423","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design Methodology for Power Efficiency Optimization of High-Speed Equalized-Electrical I/O Architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Integrated circuit modeling","CMOS integrated circuits","Receivers","Transistors","Semiconductor device modeling","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","CMOS logic circuits","current density","current-mode logic","equalisers","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design methodology","power efficiency optimization","high-speed equalized-electrical I-O architectures","per-channel data rate","high-speed input-output links","inter-chip bandwidth demand","band-limited channels","data rate scaling","equalization circuitry","frequency-dependent loss compensation","system power budgets","power optimization design flow","high-speed electrical links","process technology node","statistical link analysis technique","normalized transistor parameters","constant current density methodology","optimum equalization architecture","circuit logic style","CMOS","current-mode logic","low-loss channel characteristics","circuit complexity","transmitter output swing scaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision-feedback equalization","electrical interconnects","feed-forward equalization","high-speed I/O link","power minimization","serial transceiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","displayDocTitle":"A Design Methodology for Power Efficiency Optimization of High-Speed Equalized-Electrical I/O Architectures","volume":"21","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6289381/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686265","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design Methodology for Power Efficiency Optimization of High-Speed Equalized-Electrical I/O Architectures","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-palermo-2211628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066224S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6565423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6565423","articleId":"6289381","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289385,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The most suitable technology that can meet the high reliability requirement of vehicle control systems and the strict energy efficiency requirement of the sensor nodes in such harsh environment containing a large number of metal reflectors at short distance is the ultra-wideband (UWB). However, there are currently no detailed models describing the UWB channel for IVWSNs, making it difficult to design a suitable communication system. We analyze the small-scale and large-scale statistics of the UWB channel beneath the chassis of a vehicle by collecting data at various locations with 81 measurement points per transmitter-receiver pair for different types of vehicles, including the scenarios of turning the engine on and movement on the road. Collecting multiple measurements allows us to both improve the accuracy of the large-scale fading representation and model small-scale fading characteristics. The path-loss exponent around the tires and other locations beneath the chassis are found to be very different, requiring separate models. The power variation around the path loss has lognormal distribution. The clustering phenomenon observed in the averaged power delay profile (PDP) is well characterized by the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) model. The cluster amplitude and decay rate are formulated as a function of the cluster arrival times using dual-slope linear models. Cluster interarrival times are modeled using Weibull distribution, providing a better fit than the commonly used exponential distribution in the literature, mainly due to the nonrandomness of the local structure of the vehicle. The variations of local PDPs around the small-scale averaged (SSA) PDPs, in decibels, at each delay bin are modeled by Gaussian distribution with variance independent of the value of the delay and distance between the transmitter and the receiver. The analysis of the model parameters for different vehicles and different scenarios demonstrates the robustness of our modeling approach exhibiting small variance in channel parameters for different vehicle types. Finally, the algorithm for generating the channel model is given. The generated PDPs are in good agreement with the experimental profiles, validating our model.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2215969","startPage":"14","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06289385.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2215969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-wideband Channel Model for Intra-vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks Beneath the Chassis: From Statistical Model to Simulations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Delay","Fading","Receivers","Channel models","Tires","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","statistical analysis","ultra wideband communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband channel model","intra vehicular wireless sensor networks","statistical model","simulation","maintenance savings","fuel efficiency","wires","sensor technology","vehicles","intelligent tires","reliability requirement","vehicle control system","strict energy efficiency requirement","sensor nodes","harsh environment","metal reflectors","UWB channel","communication system","transmitter receiver pair","fading representation","model small scale fading characteristics","path loss exponent","lognormal distribution","clustering phenomenon","averaged power delay profile","Saleh-Valenzuela model","cluster amplitude","decay rate","cluster arrival times","dual slope linear model","Weibull distribution","nonrandomness","delay bin","Gaussian distribution","variance independent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel models","ultra wideband technology","vehicles","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-wideband Channel Model for Intra-vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks Beneath the Chassis: From Statistical Model to Simulations","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6289385/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13219862","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-wideband Channel Model for Intra-vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks Beneath the Chassis: From Statistical Model to Simulations","sourcePdf":"tvt-bas-2215969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095767S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6289385","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6289386,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Guo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6410063/6289386/6289386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Guo received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communications engineering from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communication and networking from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in March 2009.","Since May 2009, he has been a Research Fellow with the Centre for Communication Systems Research, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K. His research interests include radio resource and mobility management, self-organizing networks, and network virtualization."]},"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37306480000"},{"name":"Atta ul Quddus","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6410063/6289386/6289386-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Atta ul Quddus received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 1999 and the M.Sc. degree in satellite communications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mobile communications from the University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K., in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Research Fellow with the Centre for Communication Systems Research, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey.

Although each femtocell only covers a small area, a massive deployment is expected to form networked femtocells in the near future. One immediate challenge is to provide seamless mobility support for networked femtocells with minimal support from mobile core networks. In this paper, we propose efficient local mobility management schemes for networked femtocells based on X2 traffic forwarding under the Third-Generation Partnership Project Long-Term Evolution Advanced (3GPP LTE-A) framework. Instead of implementing the path switch operation at core network entity for each handover, a local traffic forwarding chain is constructed to use the existing Internet backhaul and the local path between the local anchor femtocell and the target femtocell for ongoing session communications. Both analytical studies and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed schemes and compare them with the original 3GPP scheme. The results indicate that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the signaling cost and relieve the processing burden of mobile core networks with the reasonable distributed cost for local traffic forwarding. In addition, the proposed schemes can enable fast session recovery to adapt to the self-deployment nature of the femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2012.2215929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6410063/06289386.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2012.2215929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410063","startPage":"326","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Mobility Management for Networked Femtocells Based on X2 Traffic Forwarding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local Mobility Management for Networked Femtocells Based on X2 Traffic Forwarding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13219863","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6289386/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Mobility Management for Networked Femtocells Based on X2 Traffic Forwarding","sourcePdf":"tvt-guo-2215929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08183S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6410063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6410063","articleId":"6289386","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6289387,"authors":[{"name":"Guangping Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guangping","lastName":"Li","id":"37676167700"},{"name":"Steven D.

Conventional equalizers require numerous switches and/or magnetic components; hence, the circuit complexity and size tend to increase. In this paper, a double-switch single-transformer equalizer, which is based on the combination of a half-bridge inverter and a voltage multiplier, is proposed. The operation of the proposed equalizer is analyzed in detail, and a dc equivalent circuit is mathematically derived. Experimental equalization tests were performed for eight SCs connected in series under a voltage-imbalanced condition. The energy of the series-connected SCs was preferentially redistributed to SCs with low voltages, and eventually, the voltage imbalance was eliminated, demonstrating the equalization performance. Simulation-based equalizations using the derived dc equivalent circuit were also performed under the same condition as the experiments. The experimental and simulation results were in good agreement, indicating that the derived dc equivalent circuit can adequately express real equalization profiles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289389/","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6289389/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13115793","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 November 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Double-Switch Single-Transformer Cell Voltage Equalizer Using a Half-Bridge Inverter and a Voltage Multiplier for Series-Connected Supercapacitors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-Switch Single-Transformer Cell Voltage Equalizer Using a Half-Bridge Inverter and a Voltage Multiplier for Series-Connected Supercapacitors","sourcePdf":"tvt-uno-2215892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082622S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6353156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6353156","articleId":"6289389","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289391,"authors":[{"name":"Dae-Young Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6320632/6289391/6289391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dae-Young Yoon received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Soong-Sil University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2007.

The experimental results not only confirm the superiority of multiple kernel learning algorithms, but also indicate that multiple kernel SVM is a kind of highly competitive data-driven modeling method for the blast furnace system and can provide reliable indication for blast furnace operators to take control actions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289392/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13030433","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289392/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Constructing Multiple Kernel Learning Framework for Blast Furnace Automation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing Multiple Kernel Learning Framework for Blast Furnace Automation","sourcePdf":"tase-gao-2211100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096662S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6319440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6319440","articleId":"6289392","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6289393,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/6319440/6289393/6289393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guangyong Li (M'07\u2013SM'01) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 1992, the M.S. degree in aerospace engineering from the Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China, in 1999, and the Ph.

As the AFM image is used as a reference for most manipulation mechanisms, the image distorted by drift will cause problems for AFM-based manipulation because the displayed positions of the objects under nanomanipulation do not match their actual locations. The drift during manipulation, similarly, will further exacerbate the mismatch between the displayed positions and the actual locations. Such mismatch is a major hurdle to achieve automation in AFM-based nanomanipulation. Without proper compensation, manipulation based on a wrong displayed location of the object often fails. In this paper, we present an algorithm to identify and eliminate the drift-induced distortion in the AFM image by applying a strategic local scan method. Briefly, after an AFM image is captured, the entire image is divided into several parts along vertical direction. A quick local scan is performed in each part of the image to measure the drift value in that very part. In this manner, the drift value is calculated in a small local area instead of the global image. Thus, the drift can be more precisely estimated and the actual position of the objects can be more accurately identified. In this paper, we also present the strategy to constantly compensate the drift during manipulation. By applying local scan on a single fixed feature in the AFM image frequently, the most current positions of all objects can be displayed in the augmented reality for real-time visual feedback.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2012.2211077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6319440/06289393.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2012.2211077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drift Compensation in AFM-Based Nanomanipulation by Strategic Local Scan","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289393/","displayDocTitle":"Drift Compensation in AFM-Based Nanomanipulation by Strategic Local Scan","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030434","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289393/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drift Compensation in AFM-Based Nanomanipulation by Strategic Local Scan","sourcePdf":"tase-li-2211077-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08941S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6319440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6319440","articleId":"6289393","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":6289395,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Yun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6486561/6289395/6289395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong-Yun Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

The proposed processor addresses two issues of SIMT architecture: branch divergence of concurrently executed threads and contention in a shared memory. Performance degradation due to the branch divergence is reduced by dividing a wide SIMT datapath into several narrow SIMT cores that execute independent threads asynchronously. The contention in a shared memory caused by the multiple SIMT cores is alleviated by introducing a new time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme using multi-phase clocks. The SIMT cores send their requests to a shared memory sequentially not concurrently by synchronizing the SIMT cores with multi-phase clocks to hide arbitration delays. The processor achieves the same datapath utilization as 4-wide SIMT which has been widely used by CPU-based ray tracers while its area remains 68% of the 4-wide SIMT. As a result, the performance normalized to area is improved by 26% compared to previous work with negligible overheads (2.6% for area and 1% for power consumption). The chip was fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, and it contains 2.3 M logic gates and 19.3 KB SRAM.

Throughout the paper, we present and discuss the principle for the selective common-mode suppression, the circuit model of the structure (including the models under even- and odd-mode excitation), the strategies for bandwidth enhancement of the rejected common mode, and a methodology for common-mode filter design. On the basis of the dispersion relation for the common mode, it is shown that the maximum achievable rejection bandwidth can be estimated. Finally, theory is validated by designing and measuring a differential line and a balanced bandpass filter with common-mode suppression, where double-slit CSRRs (DS-CSRRs) are used in order to enhance the common-mode rejection bandwidth. Due to the presence of DS-CSRRs, the balanced filter exhibits more than 40 dB of common-mode rejection within a 34% bandwidth around the filter pass band.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2012.2209675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6314489/06289399.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2012.2209675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314489","startPage":"3023","endPage":"3034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common-Mode Suppression in Microstrip Differential Lines by Means of Complementary Split Ring Resonators: Theory and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Common-Mode Suppression in Microstrip Differential Lines by Means of Complementary Split Ring Resonators: Theory and Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13030680","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289399/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common-Mode Suppression in Microstrip Differential Lines by Means of Complementary Split Ring Resonators: Theory and Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-naqui-2209675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106799S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6314489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"6314489","articleId":"6289399","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6289402,"authors":[{"name":"Jingguo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Operations Management, College of Business, University ofTexas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jingguo Wang received the Ph.D. degree in Management Science and Systems from the State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo.

Research question: How do individuals process a phishing email, and determine whether to respond to it? Specifically, this study examines how users' attention to \u201cvisual triggers\u201d and \u201cphishing deception indicators\u201d influence their decision-making processes and consequently their decisions. Literature review: This paper draws upon the theory of deception and the literature on mediated cognition and learning, including the critical role of attention and elaboration in deception detection. From this literature, we developed a research model to suggest that overall cognitive effort expended in email processing decreases with attention to visual triggers and phishing deception indicators. The likelihood to respond to phishing emails increases with attention to visceral cues, but decreases with attention to phishing deception indicators and cognitive effort. Knowledge of email-based scams increases attention to phishing deception indicators, and directly decreases response likelihood. It also moderates the impact of attention to visceral triggers and that of phishing deception indicators on likelihood to respond. Methodology: Using a real phishing email as a stimulus, a survey of 321 members of a public university community in the Northeast US, who were intended victims of a spear phishing attack that took place, was conducted. The survey used validated measures developed in prior literature for the most part and tested results using the partial least-squares regression. Results and discussion: Our research model and hypotheses were supported by the data except that we did not find that cognitive effort significantly affects response likelihood. The implication of the study is that attention to visceral triggers, attention to phishing deception indicators, and phishing knowledge play critical roles in phishing detection. The limitations of the study were that the data were drawn from students, and the study explored one phishing attack, relied on some single-item measures, cognitive effort measure, and a one-round survey. Future research would examine the impact of a varying degree of urgency and a varying level of phishing deception indicators, and actual victims of phishing attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289402/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13146853","volume":"55","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Research Article Phishing Susceptibility: An Investigation Into the Processing of a Targeted Spear Phishing Email","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research Article Phishing Susceptibility: An Investigation Into the Processing of a Targeted Spear Phishing Email","sourcePdf":"tpc-wang-2208392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14635S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"47","isNumber":"6357293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"47","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6357293","articleId":"6289402","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6289403,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Conventional synchronous generators can help to compensate for wind fluctuations, but the slow behavior of such systems may result in stability concerns. Here, the virtual inertia method, which imitates the kinetic inertia of synchronous generator, is used to improve the system dynamic behavior. Since the proposed method focuses on short-term oscillations and incorporates no long-term power regulation, it needs no mass storage device. Thus, the method is economical. To prevent any additional cost, the rotating mass connected to the DFIG shaft or a super-capacitor connected to the DC-link of a back-to-back inverter of a wind power generator could be used. The concept and the proposed control methods are discussed in detail. Eigen-value analysis is used to study how the proposed method improves system stability. The advantages and disadvantages of using DFIG rotating mass or super-capacitor as the virtual inertia source are compared. The proposed approach also shows that while virtual inertia is not incorporated directly in long-term frequency and power regulation, it may enhance the system steady-state behavior indirectly. A time domain simulation is used to verify the results of the analytical studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","volume":"28","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13934202","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6289404/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementing Virtual Inertia in DFIG-Based Wind Power Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing Virtual Inertia in DFIG-Based Wind Power Generation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-fakharimoghaddamarani-2207972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096804S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6504806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"6504806","articleId":"6289404","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6289406,"authors":[{"name":"Lisa Ruttledge","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Communications Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Lisa Ruttledge (S\u201910) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from University College Dublin, Ireland, in 2010.

One issue, of particular concern, is the resulting reduction in system inertia since modern variable speed wind turbines do not inherently contribute to the inertial response of the system. Such devices can, however, be fitted with a control loop which provides an active power response to significant frequency deviations, similar to the inertial response of fixed speed wind turbines and synchronous generation. Unlike conventional machines, however, the response of variable speed turbines is dependent on local wind speeds and so cannot be quantified deterministically by system operators. As a result, it is likely that uncertainty will exist over the inertial response capability of the system at high wind penetration levels.

The FSAN meeting in April 2012 selected the time- and wavelength-division multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON) as a primary solution to NG-PON2. In this paper, we summarize the TWDM-PON research in FSAN by reviewing the basics of TWDM-PON and presenting the world's first full-system 40 Gb/s TWDM-PON prototype. After introducing the TWDM-PON architecture, we explore TWDM-PON wavelength plan options to meet the NG-PON2 requirements. TWDM-PON key technologies and their respective level of development are further discussed to investigate its feasibility and availability. The first full-system 40 Gb/s TWDM-PON prototype is demonstrated to provide 40 Gb/s downstream and 10 Gb/s upstream bandwidth. This full prototype system offers 38 dB power budget and supports 20 km distance with a 1:512 split ratio. It coexists with commercially deployed Gigabit PON (G-PON) and 10 Gigabit PON (XG-PON) systems. The operator-vendor joint test results testify that TWDM-PON is achievable by the reuse and integration of commercial devices and components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2013","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289432/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2013","accessionNumber":"13218510","volume":"31","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) for Next-Generation PON Stage 2 (NG-PON2)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) for Next-Generation PON Stage 2 (NG-PON2)","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"jlt-luo-2215841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062439S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6401181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"337","xplore-issue":"6401181","articleId":"6289432","onlineDate":"28 August 2012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289453,"authors":[{"name":"Antonis G.

Therefore, advanced cellular network releases, such as long-term evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), should efficiently cater to M2M communications.

The algorithm is general in the sense that it can be applied to tracks from any type of sensor. Two important enhancements to the standard algorithm are outlined. The first of these characterizes predictable temporal variations in behavior, the so-called rhythm of life. This allows the detection of unusual activity during one part of the day that would be considered normal at other times. The second development analyzes the bulk behavior of targets. Although tracks on their own may not be unusual, their combined actions could be suspicious. Also, bulk activity analysis allows the detection of missing expected behavior, which is not possible with many techniques.

For multimodal posteriors, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is a logical choice, but it is not readily available from the SMC output. In principle, the MAP can be obtained by maximizing the posterior density obtained e.g. by the particle based approximation of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. However, this posterior is a mixture distribution with many local maxima, which makes the optimization problem very hard. We suggest an algorithm for estimating the MAP using the global optimization principle of Pincus and subsequently outline the frameworks for estimating the filter and marginal smoother MAP of a dynamical system from the SMC output.","startPage":"114","endPage":"120","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269381/6289713/06289794.pdf","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Importance sampling applied to Pincus maximization for particle filter MAP estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Importance sampling applied to Pincus maximization for particle filter MAP estimation","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289794/","accessionNumber":"12965651","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289794/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance sampling applied to Pincus maximization for particle filter MAP estimation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"016417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053006S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269381","isNumber":"6289713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269381","xplore-issue":"6289713","articleId":"6289794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6289832,"authors":[{"name":"Regina Kaune","affiliation":["Department SDF, Fraunhofer FKIE/University of Bonn, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Regina","lastName":"Kaune","id":"37680345100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-5-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0417-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-4-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6289832","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289832","abstract":"In sensor networks, passive localization can be performed by exploiting the received signals of unknown emitters.

A comparison is performed investigating the attainable accuracies for localization based on TDOA and TOA measurements given by the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Using the Maximum Likelihood estimator, some characteristic features of the cost functions are investigated indicating a better performance of the TOA approach.

Knowledge of this region permits to achieve the desired performance level in the detection system (e.g., the time for taking a decision in a sequential probability ratio test or the probability of miss in a likelihood ratio test) and, if a cost function is assigned, to carry out optimal waveform design.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269381/6289713/06289897.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"901","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kullback-Leibler divergence region in MIMO radar detection problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Cost function","MIMO","Encoding","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Level set"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO radar","probability","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kullback-Leibler divergence region","MIMO radar detection problem","space-time code design","multiple-input detection system","multiple-output detection system","code matrix","sequential probability ratio test","probability","optimal waveform design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Kullback-Leibler divergence region in MIMO radar detection problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965754","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kullback-Leibler divergence region in MIMO radar detection problems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"122154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081183S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269381","isNumber":"6289713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269381","xplore-issue":"6289713","articleId":"6289897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF ( Intl Society of Information Fusi","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6289932,"authors":[{"name":"Jason L.

In this paper we study a method which combines these two approaches. Our work is motivated by a recent paper, which proves that the full Bayes RFS filter naturally incorporates a Poisson component representing targets that have never been detected, and a linear combination of multi-Bernoulli components representing targets under track. Here we demonstrate the benefit (in speed of track initiation) that maintenance of a Poisson component of never detected targets provides. Subsequently, we propose a method of recycling, which projects Bernoulli components with a low probability of existence onto the Poisson component (as opposed to deleting them). We show that this allows us to achieve similar tracking performance using a fraction of the number of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289713","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269381/6289713/06289932.pdf","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Poisson and multi-Bernoulli filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Poisson and multi-Bernoulli filters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6289932/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965782","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289932/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Poisson and multi-Bernoulli filters","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"150315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058257S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269381","isNumber":"6289713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269381","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6289713","articleId":"6289932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6289940,"authors":[{"name":"Kira Kowalska","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Centre, BAE Systems, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Kira","lastName":"Kowalska","id":"38469567300"},{"name":"Leto Peel","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Leto","lastName":"Peel","id":"37658033200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-5-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0417-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-0-9824438-4-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6289940","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1051},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Marine vehicles","Data models","Computational modeling","Accuracy","Gaussian processes","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","behavioural sciences","computational complexity","data mining","Gaussian processes","identification technology","learning (artificial intelligence)","sampling methods","training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maritime anomaly detection","Gaussian process active learning","normal vessel behaviours","illegal behaviour detection","suspicious behaviour detection","unsafe behaviour detection","data-driven nonparametric Bayesian model","normal shipping behaviour model","automatic identification system data","AIS data","informative data subsampling","training computational complexity","newly-observed transmission","artificially generated AIS anomalies detection","United Kingdom","real vessel data","artificial vessel data"]}],"abstract":"A model of normal vessel behaviours is useful for detecting illegal, suspicious, or unsafe behaviour; such as vessel theft, drugs smuggling, people trafficking or poor sailing. This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maritime anomaly detection using Gaussian Process active learning","publicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion","pdfPath":"/iel5/6269381/6289713/06289940.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6289940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6289940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"Maritime anomaly detection using Gaussian Process active learning","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6289940/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12965790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maritime anomaly detection using Gaussian Process active learning","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"158304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050438S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6269381","isNumber":"6289713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6269381","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6289713","articleId":"6289940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
