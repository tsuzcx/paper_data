The method operates by extracting one or more meshes to enclose the visible region of the volume and allow surfaces to be textured. These meshes determine ray start-end positions and store the information that will be mapped onto the volume. Using a multi-pass approach, we first peel depth layers from the rendered geometry, storing color and depth in a series of corresponding buffers. Second, a GPU-based raycasting pass is performed that traverses rays between the outermost mesh layers. Ray-layer intersections are determined so that the color texture mapped onto the mesh is composited in the correct order with volume samples. The proposed method can be used to enhance volumetric objects in games and other applications.","doi":"10.1109/CGAMES.2011.6000333","publicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Computer Games (CGAMES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 16th International Conference on Computer Games (CGAMES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5989687/6000305/06000333.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGAMES.2011.6000333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture mapping volumes using GPU-based polygon-assisted raycasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6000333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6000333/","displayDocTitle":"Texture mapping volumes using GPU-based polygon-assisted raycasting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12207680","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6000333/","conferenceDate":"27-30 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture mapping volumes using GPU-based polygon-assisted raycasting","confLoc":"Louisville, KY, USA","sourcePdf":"paper22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065547S","chronDate":"27-30 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5989687","isNumber":"6000305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5989687","xplore-issue":"6000305","articleId":"6000333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6000400,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38546455100"},{"name":"Ye San","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"San","id":"37271912300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-988-17255-9-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0677-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"6000400","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6000400","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Convergence","Optimization","Benchmark testing","Signal processing algorithms","Robustness","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quantum theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved quantum genetic algorithm","population center","personal best population","evolutionary process","adaptive adjustment","population diversity coefficient","optimization performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Genetic Algorithm","Population Diversity","Numerical Optimization"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/5980617/6000362/06000400.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","startPage":"5368","endPage":"5371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved quantum genetic algorithm and performance analysis","abstract":"Aiming at the drawback of being easily trapped into the local optimum and premature convergence in quantum genetic algorithm, an improved quantum genetic algorithm was proposed.

This is the main reason why particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is prone to trap into local minima. A new improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed, in which is guaranteed to converge to the global optimization solution with probability one. During the running time, the mutation probability for the current particle is determined by the variance of the individual's concentration and convergence function. The ability of IPSO to break away from the local optimum is greatly improved by the mutation. The concept of adaptive acceleration factor is introduced to the IPSO. In this manner, the global and local search capability can be coordinated to make for locating the global optimum quickly. Finally, IPSO is applied to optimize several test functions. Test results show that IPSO can find global optima effectively.","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2049","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5980617/6000362/06000429.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive particle swarm optimization with mutation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Electronic mail","Convergence","Acceleration","Nickel","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","convergence","particle swarm optimisation","probability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved particle swarm optimization","global optimization solution","mutation probability","convergence","adaptive acceleration factor","search capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization algorithm","Mutation","Adaptive","Global optima"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6000429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive particle swarm optimization with mutation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12214064","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive particle swarm optimization with mutation","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"0273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030301S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2011","isNumber":"6000362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980617","articleId":"6000429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6000448,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Ma","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China","School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, P.

This paper presents a hybrid sampling strategy in the PRM framework to improve the distributions of road signs. It proposes the Randomized Star Builder (RSB) to identify narrow passages in the workspace, and uses the hybrid strategy to sample road signs in the corresponding configuration space. The density of points in the roadmap is then increased in the narrow passages. Moreover, global roadmaps using Uniform Sampler are also configured to rationalize the milestone distribution so as to improve the path planning efficiency.

The GOSFNN extends the ellipsoidal basis function (EBF)-based fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) by permitting input variables to be modeled by dissymmetrical Gaussian functions (DGFs). Due to the flexibility and dissymmetry of left and right widths of the DGF, the partitioning made by DGFs in the input space is more flexible and more economical, and therefore results in a parsimonious FNN with high performance under the online learning algorithm. The geometric growing criteria and the error reduction ratio (ERR) method are used as rule growing strategies to realize the structure learning algorithm which implements an optimal and compact network structure. The proposed GOSFNN starts with no hidden neurons and does not need to partition the input space a priori. In addition, all the free parameters in premises and consequents are online adjusted by using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach. The performance of the proposed GOSFNN paradigm is compared with other well-known algorithms like OLS, RBF-AFS, DFNN, GDFNN and FAOS-PFNN, etc., on a benchmark problem in the field of nonlinear dynamic system identification. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GOSFNN approach would be able to facilitate a more powerful and more economical fuzzy neural network with better identification performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6000700/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12256318","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6000700/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Online Self-organizing Fuzzy Neural Network for nonlinear dynamic system identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Online Self-organizing Fuzzy Neural Network for nonlinear dynamic system identification","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"0792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060546S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5980617","isNumber":"6000362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980617","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6000362","articleId":"6000700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Assoc of Automati","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6000719,"authors":[{"name":"Yungao Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Yungao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37599948500"},{"name":"Bin Xian","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xian","id":"37282816500"},{"name":"Qiang Yin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37892431800"},{"name":"Haotao Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Haotao","lastName":"Li","id":"37900525900"},{"name":"Wei Zeng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37890768600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-988-17255-9-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0677-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"6000719","dbTime":"61 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":839},"abstract":"The quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been a hot area for the research of unmanned aerial vehicles.

A time-delay BP neural network is used to model the superheater system. With analysis of the boiler construction and operation characteristic, the inputs and outputs of the NN models are determined. Two NN inverse models are established, trained and validated with abundant historical operation data over wide-range load-changing condition. The trained models are then employed as NN controllers to improve the SST control effect by providing real-time supplementary signals to the original cascade PID controllers. Real-time SST feedback signal is introduced to automatically adjust the reference values of the NN controllers. The control scheme is programmed with MATLAB, which communicates real-time with a full-scope simulator of the 600MW supercritical coal-fired power unit. Comprehensive control simulation tests are carried out, which shows that the new NN inverse compensation control scheme can dramatically improve the SST control quality of the supercritical boiler.","startPage":"2731","endPage":"2736","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000362","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5980617/6000362/06001115.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-compensated neural network inverse control for Superheated Steam Temperature of a 600MW supercritical boiler unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6001115/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-compensated neural network inverse control for Superheated Steam Temperature of a 600MW supercritical boiler unit","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12383809","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-compensated neural network inverse control for Superheated Steam Temperature of a 600MW supercritical boiler unit","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"1561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02726S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2011","isNumber":"6000362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980617","articleId":"6001115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6001176,"authors":[{"name":"Kang-Le Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Eng., Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Kang-Le","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088001234"},{"name":"Jiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Eng., Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085374696"},{"name":"Xi-Le Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Eng., Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Xi-Le","lastName":"Wei","id":"37404704700"},{"name":"Bin Deng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Automation Eng., Tianjin University, 300072, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Deng","id":"37409498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-988-17255-9-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0677-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"6001176","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Neurons","MATLAB","Computational modeling","Computer languages","Biological neural networks","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Morris-Lecar model neurons","neural network dynamic characteristic","FPGA","chemical synapse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neuron","Neural Network","Dynamic","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001176","abstract":"Based on the dynamics of neurons, we use the FPGA to realize Morris-Lecar (ML) model, and to achieve dynamic analysis such as bifurcation.etc in this paper, obtaining the corresponding firing patterns; then we use the FPGA to achieve the ML neuron network which is connected by chemical synapse, and analyze the affection of parameters on the neural network dynamic characteristics; At the same time, the FPGA implementation is compared with the MATLAB simulation.

The proposed RBFNDOB is a simple modification of the original DOB by using a RBFN to identify the inverse model of system which can track the parameter variations of real system by an on-line learning algorithm. The non-minimum phase system can be transformed into minimum phase system by constructing a pseudo-system to solve the zero dynamics in the right half plane. The RBFNDOB combining with a feedback controller can effectively suppress the disturbances of the closed-loop systems.

Different from literature [27], the time-varying delay interval is more general and the uncertainties are Markovian form , thus covers the system studied in [27] as a special case.","startPage":"2810","endPage":"2814","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5980617/6000362/06001572.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 30th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-dependent passivity analysis for delayed neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Biological neural networks","Delay effects","Asymptotic stability","Uncertainty","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","linear matrix inequalities","Markov processes","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-dependent passivity analysis","delayed neural network","Markovian jumping parameter","mode-dependent Lyapunov functional","slack variable","linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay-dependent Conditions","Markovian Jumping Parameters","Passivity","Time-varying Delays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6001572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Delay-dependent passivity analysis for delayed neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6001572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"22-24 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-dependent passivity analysis for delayed neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"2342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116629S","chronDate":"22-24 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5980617","isNumber":"6000362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5980617","xplore-issue":"6000362","articleId":"6001572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Assoc of Automati","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6001604,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhu Xie","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Academy of Armored Force Engineering, Beijing 100072, China"],"firstName":"Xiaozhu","lastName":"Xie","id":"37088005716"},{"name":"Bing Hou","affiliation":["Ministry of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, General Armament Department, Beijing 100034, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Hou","id":"37088001697"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-988-17255-9-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0677-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"CD","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"6001604","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001604","abstract":"Object recognition using BP neural network is a common method nowadays.

At first, the change detection module modifies the forgetting factor online according to ESN output errors. And then, the RLS algorithm regulates the ESN output connection weights.

Hard real-time settings, in contrast, place different demands on dynamic memory allocators: worst-case response times are more important than average-case response times. Furthermore, predictable cache behavior is a prerequisite for timing analysis to derive tight bounds on a program's execution time. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that meets these demands. It guarantees constant response times, does not cause unpredictable cache pollution, and allocations are cache-set directed, i.e., allocated memory is guaranteed to be mapped to a given cache set. The latter two are necessary to enable a subsequent precise static cache analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 23rd Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6000304/6001639/06001767.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2011 23rd Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2011.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2011.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAMA: A Predictable Cache-Aware Memory Allocator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Dynamic scheduling","Real time systems","Memory management","Time factors","Merging","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computational complexity","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAMA","cache-aware memory allocator","general-purpose dynamic memory allocation algorithms","small memory fragmentation","average-case response times","worst-case response times"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic storage allocation","WCET analysis","predictability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6001767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"CAMA: A Predictable Cache-Aware Memory Allocator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6001767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12207909","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAMA: A Predictable Cache-Aware Memory Allocator","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"4442a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047867S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6000304","isNumber":"6001639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6000304","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6001639","articleId":"6001767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6001832,"authors":[{"name":"Xiu-kun Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xiu-kun Yang","id":"37087872715"},{"name":"Yang Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yang Luo","id":"37087312368"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6001832","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001832","abstract":"The performance of an automatic fingerprint authentication system relies heavily on the quality of fingerprint images.

In DS-CDMA cellular systems, this is limited by the interference present in the link. The interference is affected by many environmental factors and thus the link capacity of the systems changes with the environment. In addition, since various traffic types mutually interfere with different amount, their different power levels affect the link capacity. Actual capacity of the systems must be evaluated accurately and call admission control (CAC) needs to be adapted to the actual capacity which varies with the environment. Since the capacity of CDMA system is limited by the reverse link, we are concerned with the reverse link and analyze the actual link capacity for multimedia services under varying environments. The analysis results yield a CAC adaptive to dynamically varying environment for multimedia services and thus improve CDMA capacity significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981419/6001647/06001873.pdf","startPage":"6207","endPage":"6210","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMT.2011.6001873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMT.2011.6001873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive call admissions for multimedia services in DS-CDMA cellular systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","multimedia communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA cellular systems","adaptive call admissions","multimedia services","link capacity","interference","environmental factors","call admission control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","capacity","adaptive call admisiions","multimedia"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6001873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive call admissions for multimedia services in DS-CDMA cellular systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6001873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12338951","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive call admissions for multimedia services in DS-CDMA cellular systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"IC27242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058095S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981419","isNumber":"6001647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981419","xplore-issue":"6001647","articleId":"6001873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6001900,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Feng","affiliation":["VLSI Institute, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Feng","id":"37590210900"},{"name":"Zeqi Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"lastName":"Zeqi Yu","id":"37088002899"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6001900","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Pulse width modulation","Noise","Power amplifiers","Error correction","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","error correction","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital class D power amplifiers","error correction","power stage","power supply noise","delta-sigma modulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta-Sigma modulator","digital class D power amplifier","power stage","power supply noise","PWM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6001900","doi":"10.1109/ICMT.2011.6001900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMT.2011.6001900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001647","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981419/6001647/06001900.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of error correction for power stage in digital class d power amplifiers","abstract":"In a digital class D power amplifier, an error is introduced into the input signal being amplified in power stage, due to the effect of power supply noise.

Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art algorithms fail to generate a precise disparity map rapidly enough for VLSI real time processing. Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular global optimization algorithm and has several advantages for hardware implementation. However, it requires high bandwidth, memory and computational costs. Tile-based BP is an efficient improved BP for hardware implementation. Boundary messages loaded from different directions have been performed with different iterations. As a result, energy cost of different pixels within a tile will converge with different speed, yielding the biasing problem. In this paper, firstly, a Balance-convergence method to remove biasing problem in tile-based BP is presented. Additionally, a novel reduced message-update method to remove redundant computational costs during message-update based on tile-based BP is introduced. Compared with the original BP and the leading hardware-oriented fast method, the proposed method can reduce additions by 30 times and 2 times respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Belief propagation","Hardware","Bandwidth","Memory management","Very large scale integration","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","optimisation","three-dimensional television","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated belief propagation","hardware implementation","disparity map","3DTV","FTV systems","VLSI real time processing","global optimization algorithm","boundary messages","biasing problem","balance-convergence method","reduced message-update method","computational cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief Propagation","disparity map","VLSI","biasing problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002074","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981419/6001647/06002074.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated Belief Propagation for hardware implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated Belief Propagation for hardware implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002074/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6002074/","accessionNumber":"12314572","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated Belief Propagation for hardware implementation","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"IC75207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104022S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981419","isNumber":"6001647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981419","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6001647","articleId":"6002074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6002124,"authors":[{"name":"Aamir Nizam Ansari","affiliation":["Pune Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune, Pune, India"],"lastName":"Aamir Nizam Ansari","id":"37886462000"},{"name":"Siddharth Patil","affiliation":["Pune Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Patil","id":"37896209700"},{"name":"Arundhati Navada","affiliation":["Pune Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Arundhati","lastName":"Navada","id":"37891662900"},{"name":"Aditya Peshave","affiliation":["Pune Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Peshave","id":"37891642700"},{"name":"Venkatesh Borole","affiliation":["Pune Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Borole","id":"37891641500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6002124","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Program processors","Programming","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","cloud computing","computer aided instruction","program compilers","software portability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online C++ compiler","cloud computing","on-demand network access","configurable computing resources","portability problem reduction","storage space","code compilation","Web-based application","network connection","online C compiler","online examination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online Compiler","Cloud computing","Compiler"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.

The ability to use different compilers allows a programmer to pick up the fastest or the most convenient tool to compile the code and remove the errors. Moreover, a web-based application can be used remotely throughout any network connection and it is platform independent. The errors/outputs of the code are stored in a more convenient way. Also, the trouble of installing the compiler on each computer is avoided.

The CS framework suggests that the signal can be reconstructed from the sub-samples by some recovery algorithm when the signal is sparse. We propose an improved video coding scheme to compress the depth map by Total Variation (TV) minimization in the pixel domain from the quantized/dequantized transform coefficients due to the extremely sparse gradient of depth maps. We keep all the frequency coefficients to avoid introducing noise to the reconstruction results. The TV minimization solver is integrated into the standard encoder, and the proposed coding scheme chooses the optimal recovery method by using the Rate-distortion Optimization (RDO) method. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme is highly efficient for the depth map sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981419/6001647/06002202.pdf","startPage":"3401","endPage":"3404","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved video coding scheme for depth map sequences based on compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Transforms","Encoding","Compressed sensing","Video coding","TV","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding scheme","depth map sequences","compressed sensing","signal processing","signal reconstruction","recovery algorithm","total variation minimization","dequantized transform coefficients","extremely sparse gradient","standard encoder","rate-distortion optimization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","TV minimazition","sparse gradient","depth map","partial frequency coefficients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An improved video coding scheme for depth map sequences based on compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6002202/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12325444","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved video coding scheme for depth map sequences based on compressed sensing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"IC94386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059325S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981419","isNumber":"6001647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981419","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6001647","articleId":"6002202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6002215,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Lei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Lei Wang","id":"37601153400"},{"name":"Chun-Hui Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Hui Zhao","id":"37287524500"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Ying Wang","id":"37601142700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6002215","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Detectors","Correlation","Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image classification","principal component analysis","remote sensing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace band section","RX algorithm","hyperspectral remote sensing data","image classification","data redundancy","data complexity","hyperspectral imagery anomaly detection","adaptive subspace decomposition algorithm","spectral waveband correlation","principle component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hyperspectral imagery","anomaly detection","adaptive subspace decomposition","principle component analysis","RX detector"]}],"abstract":"Large amount of spectral wavebands of hyperspectral remote sensing data provide an abundant and valuable information for classification and detection, but at the same time, this will lead to redundancy and complexity of the data.

Firstly, the adaptive subspace decomposition (ASD) algorithm divides the HSI data of high dimension to subsets of low dimension according to the correlation between spectral wavebands. Then principle component analysis (PCA) is used in each subspace to select certain principle components for RX detection. At last, fuse the results of each subspace and get the anomaly elements through a certain threshold. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002215","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Multimedia Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5981419/6001647/06002215.pdf","startPage":"3436","endPage":"3439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMT.2011.6002215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6001647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection using subspace band section based RX algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002215/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection using subspace band section based RX algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12325446","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6002215/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection using subspace band section based RX algorithm","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"IC97053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058621S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5981419","isNumber":"6001647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5981419","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6001647","articleId":"6002215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6002260,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Fang","affiliation":["Basic Department, First Aeronautic Institute of AirForce, Xinyang, China"],"lastName":"Liu Fang","id":"37087333876"},{"name":"L\u00fc Yinxiao","affiliation":["Training Department, First Aeronautic Institute of AirForce, Xinyang, China"],"lastName":"L\u00fc Yinxiao","id":"37087418162"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6002260","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002260","abstract":"A method for fault diagnosis of Aircraft Subsystem based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) is put forward.

However, due to lack of explicit cooperation between CR and PU systems, it is often difficult for CRs to acquire CR-to-PU channels accurately. In fact, if the PU receivers are off, the sensing algorithms cannot obtain the channels for the PU receivers, although they have to be protected nevertheless. In order to achieve aggressive spectrum re-use even in such challenging scenarios, power control algorithms that take channel uncertainty into account are developed. Both log-normal shadowing and small-scale fading effects are considered through suitable approximations. Accounting for the latter, centralized network utility maximization (NUM) problems are formulated, and their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points are obtained via sequential geometric programming. For the case where CR-to-CR channels are also uncertain, a novel outage probability-based NUM formulation is proposed, and its solution method developed in a unified fashion. Numerical tests verify the performance merits of the novel design.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.081711.110323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/06002415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.081711.110323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","startPage":"3541","endPage":"3551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359539","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6002415/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control for Cognitive Radio Networks Under Channel Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"3541-tw1110-anese.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120079S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6002415","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6002417,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jun Kim","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/6002417/6002417-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Jun Kim received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and his Ph.D. from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2005, all in electrical engineering.

In this work, spectrum sensing algorithms for CRs that support quality-of-service (QoS) traffic are investigated. Multiple bands are sensed in parallel to reduce the sensing delay, while ensuring a fixed minimum rate for CR transmissions with a given outage probability. Interference constraints are also imposed to protect PU transmissions. Both fixed sample size (FSS) as well as sequential sensing algorithms are developed to minimize the sensing delay. In the sequential sensing case, a bank of sequential probability ratio tests (SPRTs) are run in parallel to detect PU presence in all bands concurrently. Notably, the parameters for the detectors can be obtained via convex optimization. Numerical tests demonstrate that sequential sensing yields average sensing delays significantly smaller than those of FSS sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12359540","htmlLink":"/document/6002417/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Band Cognitive Radio Spectrum Sensing for Quality-of-Service Traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Band Cognitive Radio Spectrum Sensing for Quality-of-Service Traffic","sourcePdf":"3506-tw1110-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081995S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6002417","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6002419,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Bazan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/6002419/6002419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Osama Bazan (S'06, M'10) received his Bachelor (BSc.) and Master (MSc.)

Nevertheless, their effectiveness in providing additional QoS guarantees is still under-explored. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing conflicts on wireless links considering both the physical interference and the operation of the underlying directional MAC protocol. Based on a novel taxonomy, we classify the link conflicts into several categories and propose a novel colored conflict graph abstraction to model the network interference pattern in the presence of contention-based directional MAC protocols. Using the proposed colored conflict graph, we derive a closed form expression for the probability of successful transmission over a wireless link given that all the bandwidth requirements are satisfied. Based on our analysis, we formulate the bandwidth-guaranteed routing problem as an optimization problem. Since the problem is NP-hard, we present a heuristic algorithm for joint routing and admission control to find single-path bandwidth-guaranteed routes. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our conflict analysis and the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide QoS guarantees along with efficient channel utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12359541","htmlLink":"/document/6002419/","displayDocTitle":"A Conflict Analysis Framework for QoS-Aware Routing in Contention-Based Wireless Mesh Networks with Beamforming Antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Conflict Analysis Framework for QoS-Aware Routing in Contention-Based Wireless Mesh Networks with Beamforming Antennas","sourcePdf":"3267-tw1110-bazan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081606S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6002419","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6002421,"authors":[{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/6002421/6002421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Derrick Wing Kwan Ng (S'06) received the bachelor degree with First class honors and Master of Philosophy (M.

The proposed multi-cell optimality criterion is to minimize the worst-case MSE of an LS-based channel estimator. To satisfy the multi-cell optimality, it is found that the pilot sequence set, having the perfect auto-correlation property, should meet the Welch bound and the maximum magnitude of the cross-correlation function should be further minimized. Multi-cell optimal pilot sequence designs for various pilot types and their DFT representations are proposed by adopting Chu sequences and a tight upper-bound on the maximum size of the pilot sequence set is derived for a given pilot sequence length and the maximum allowed cross-correlation value. Simulation results show that the proposed pilot sequences can improve both the MSE performance and the system performance in multi-cell environments.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.082011.100939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6064710/06002423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.082011.100939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064710","startPage":"3354","endPage":"3367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Multi-Cell MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Multi-Cell MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002423/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12359543","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6002423/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pilot Sequence Design for Multi-Cell MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"3354-tw1110-kang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128305S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6002423","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6002425,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Ching Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Ching","lastName":"Lin","id":"37897602400"},{"name":"Wei-Chang Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Chang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37898237600"},{"name":"Char-Dir Chung","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Char-Dir","lastName":"Chung","id":"37334648000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6002425","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","Hamming weight","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Hadamard codes","spectral analysis","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral sidelobe decaying","Walsh Hadamard code","MC-CDMA Systems","multicarrier code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicarrier code-division multiple access","spectral sidelobe","Walsh-Hadamard code","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a spectral sidelobe-decaying property of the Walsh-Hadamard code employed in multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems is exploited.

If multiple base stations (BSs) access the same radio resource; downlink transmissions from one BS cause co-channel interference (CCI) towards towards users served by neighboring BSs. To mitigate CCI in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) network, the mobile station (MS) scheduled in a tagged cell (i.e. the active user) emits a busy burst (BB) on a time-multiplexed feedback slot, applying the precoder used earlier for receiving data. Prior to transmission a neighboring BS must scan the feedback slot using the spatial precoder(s) intended for data transmission. Consequently, in a time division duplex (TDD) system the channels of the data and the feedback slots become reciprocal. Therefore, by listening to the feedback slot, a neighboring BS can predetermine the CCI potentially imposed towards the active user for each of its available precoders. This information enables the BS to select spatial precoders autonomously so that CCI is limited to a predetermined threshold. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves 20% increase in spectral efficiency, 6-fold increase in cell-edge user throughput, and 40% reduction in transmitted energy, compared to transmit beamforming without interference coordination.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

Therefore, we propose a regularized BD precoder method based on the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criteria subject to the interference power constraint under a predetermined threshold for the PU. As a result, the proposed CR-MMSE-BD scheme improves the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at each SU's receiver, compared to the ZF-BD based method.

Compared to other proposed non-interactive localization algorithms, the weighted centroid localization (WCL) scheme uses only the received signal strength information, which makes it simple to implement and robust to variations in the propagation environment. In this paper we present the first theoretical framework for WCL performance analysis in terms of its localization error distribution parameterized by node density, node placement, shadowing variance, correlation distance and inaccuracy of sensor node positioning. Using this analysis, we quantify the robustness of WCL to various physical conditions and provide design guidelines, such as node placement and spacing, for the practical deployment of WCL. We also propose a power-efficient method for implementing WCL through a distributed cluster-based algorithm, that achieves comparable accuracy with its centralized counterpart.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6002433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","volume":"10","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12359548","publicationDate":"October 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6002433/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Centroid Localization Algorithm: Theoretical Analysis and Distributed Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Centroid Localization Algorithm: Theoretical Analysis and Distributed Implementation","sourcePdf":"3403-tw1110-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084092S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6064710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6064710","articleId":"6002433","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6002445,"authors":[{"name":"Lyes Saad Saoud","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer science, Modeling, Optimization and Electronic systems (LIMOSE), Department of Physics, University Mhamed Bougara Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Lyes","lastName":"Saad Saoud","id":"37888040800"},{"name":"Fay\u00e7al Rahmoune","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer science, Modeling, Optimization and Electronic systems (LIMOSE), Department of Physics, University Mhamed Bougara Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Fay\u00e7al","lastName":"Rahmoune","id":"37885528700"},{"name":"Victor Tourtchine","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer science, Modeling, Optimization and Electronic systems (LIMOSE), Department of Physics, University Mhamed Bougara Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Tourtchine","id":"37888041800"},{"name":"Kamel Baddari","affiliation":["Laboratory of Computer science, Modeling, Optimization and Electronic systems (LIMOSE), Department of Physics, University Mhamed Bougara Boumerdes, Algeria"],"firstName":"Kamel","lastName":"Baddari","id":"37888041500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-774-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-771-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-773-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6002445","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6002445","abstract":"The high nonlinearity and the high cost of the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) system need to realize a low cost embedded system based on an inexpensive microcontroller using the full neural networks.

First the low frequency area is obtained by decomposing the original image by wavelet, which is further decomposed by balanced multiwavelet. Then the high-frequency coefficients with highest scale are chosen as watermark embedded carrier. The normalization of gray watermarked image has greatly reduced the amount of data. The algorithm adopts additive principle to embed watermark. This algorithm has the advantages of wavelet which can concentrate energy easily in the low frequency area and characters of balanced multiwavelet transform which can distribute energy averagely. This algorithm is generally applicable of the gray watermark system.

The simulation technique, implemented in a software called COMLAB, is composed of three main modules for, respectively, describing the underwater environment, numerical modeling of the communication channel and the communication signal processing. The environment is modelled as a water layer above a fluid or solid seabed, admitting full 3D variations of the bathymetry and media parameters for realistic modelling of sites near a shoreline and inside harbour basins or archipelagos. The communication channel is represented by time-domain hybrid ray-trace/plane wave modelling of underwater sound propagation, accounting for effects with significant influence on communication performance, in particular transmission loss, bottom and surface interactions, ambient noise, reverberation, and ray path dependent doppler shifts caused by moving source, receivers or surface waves. The signal processing algrithms handle a SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) communication channel, i.e. a single transmitter and a receiver array. The algorithms employ error-corrective encoding by adding redundancy into the message bitstream and iterative channel estimation, equalization and SISO (Soft Input Soft Output) decoding formulated in likelihood ratios for the bit values. For a given communiaction scenario the complete communication chain comprised of encoding - signal emission -sound propagation - signal reception - decoding is simulated and the incurred bit error rate (BER) is computed. The bit error rate, interpretable as the probability of communication error, then provides an estimate of the communication performance. Simulations of point-to-point communication scenarios from the UAN10 field trials at Pianosa in the Mediterranean in September 2010 are presented, and compared with experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003382","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977168/6003381/06003382.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain modelling of turbo-coded underwater communication","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003382/","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207331","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003382/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain modelling of turbo-coded underwater communication","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"110113009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127223S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977168","isNumber":"6003381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977168","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6003381","articleId":"6003382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6003384,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of the most important effects is bubbles generated by breaking waves, which has major effects on high frequency acoustic propagation, sound speed profile and ambient noise due to the sound scattering and absorption properties of a thin layer of bubbles.

It is achieved by adopting the Lloyd algorithm based limited feedback procedure.

In this work, the autonomy of the AUV is evaluated in several scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003432","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003381","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977168/6003381/06003432.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A biologically inspired neural network for navigation with obstacle avoidance in autonomous underwater and surface vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003432/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A biologically inspired neural network for navigation with obstacle avoidance in autonomous underwater and surface vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003432/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12207376","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biologically inspired neural network for navigation with obstacle avoidance in autonomous underwater and surface vehicles","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"110113002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072619S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977168","isNumber":"6003381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977168","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6003381","articleId":"6003432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6003438,"authors":[{"name":"Andreja Radosevic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andreja","lastName":"Radosevic","id":"37887861100"},{"name":"Tolga M.

Our work is motivated by the design of UWA communication systems that will employ adaptive modulation, whose performance relies on the ability to predict the channel up to a few seconds into the future. The possibility of predicting the channel response is demonstrated using real data collected during an experiment conducted in shallow water off the western coast of Kauai, Hawaii, in June 2008. The key to enabling prediction is decoupling of the effects of motion-induced phase offset from the more slowly varying channel path gains. It is shown that a significant performance improvement can be achieved using prediction as compared to using outdated channel estimates.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977168/6003381/06003438.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","doi":"10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel prediction for adaptive modulation in underwater acoustic communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Prediction algorithms","Joints","Delay","Doppler effect","Matching pursuit algorithms","Propagation delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel prediction","adaptive modulation","underwater acoustic communications","underwater acoustic channel impulse response","motion-induced phase offset","varying channel path gains"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel prediction for adaptive modulation in underwater acoustic communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207382","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel prediction for adaptive modulation in underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"110114121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05384S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977168","isNumber":"6003381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977168","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6003381","articleId":"6003438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6003495,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00f6rg Kalwa","affiliation":["Atlas Elektronik GmbH, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Kalwa","id":"37428294800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0088-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0086-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0087-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6003495","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Acoustics","Physical layer","Sensors","Protocols","Hardware","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RACUN-project","robust acoustic communications","underwater network node","remote coastal monitoring","network-centric approach"]}],"abstract":"Modern armed forces are currently transforming into flexible rapid action forces.

Previous studies aiming to classify fish and other marine organisms by means of the phase angle component in their echoes have reported promising results. Similarly, the use of broadband techniques to simultaneously obtain spectral information and achieve good spatial resolution has been deemed advantageous. Therefore, broadband active sonar that utilizes both amplitude and phase would appear to be a desirable system. Adopting this approach requires suitable calibration methods that account for complex sensitivity over large bandwidths. Current calibration procedures that incorporate pulse compression with linear-frequency modulated (LFM) pulses are available but do not address phase. The present work expands on these methods in order to achieve broadband sonar amplitude and phase calibration, using spectral processing of LFM pulses and standard targets. Target phase is obtained as the difference of phase angles at two frequencies, in order to remove range effects. This paper presents time-domain scattering, together with calibrated target strength (TS) and phase spectra of solid tungsten carbide spheres and air-filled ceramic shells, obtained in a laboratory water tank. Experimental results are compared to theoretical models to validate measurements and identify underlying echo formation mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003504","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977168/6003381/06003504.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband amplitude and phase sonar calibration using LFM pulses for high-resolution study of hard and soft acoustic targets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Broadband amplitude and phase sonar calibration using LFM pulses for high-resolution study of hard and soft acoustic targets","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003504/","accessionNumber":"12207443","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003504/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband amplitude and phase sonar calibration using LFM pulses for high-resolution study of hard and soft acoustic targets","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"110114092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070365S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977168","isNumber":"6003381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6003381","articleId":"6003504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6003580,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Palmeiro","affiliation":["Nautilus Oceanica, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Palmeiro","id":"37888475100"},{"name":"Manuel Mart\u00edn","affiliation":["Nautilus Oceanica, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Mart\u00edn","id":"37897066000"},{"name":"Ian Crowther","affiliation":["WFS Technologies, Livingston, UK"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Crowther","id":"37888474600"},{"name":"Mark Rhodes","affiliation":["WFS Technologies, Livingston, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Rhodes","id":"37569818600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0088-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0086-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0087-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6003580","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1937},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater radio frequency communications","abstract":"This paper provides a broad overview of electromagnetic technologies in the context of subsea navigation/position fixing and telemetry applications.

In the context of multicarrier transmission, several important questions remain unanswered: i) should pilots be placed in clusters as for time-varying, non-sparse channels, or randomly dispersed between the data as common in the Compressive Sensing literature; ii) as pilot and data subcarriers cannot be perfectly separated at the receiver due to intercarrier interference (ICI) should channel estimation be based on observations corresponding to pilot subcarriers only, or can the data subcarriers be used to practically extract additional information about the channel; and iii) how does the performance vary with the number of pilot symbols? We use data recorded at the recent CalCom'10 experiment to investigate these questions. We find that a sufficient number of adjacent observations is required to estimate the ICI, which can either be achieved by a pilot design that uses clustered pilots, or by using data subcarriers as additional observations. When using data subcarriers as observations, the effect of the unknown data should be modeled as increased noise. Finally, by varying the number of pilot subcarriers, we can trade off error performance for data rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","pdfPath":"/iel5/5977168/6003381/06003627.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","doi":"10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of pilot designs for cyclic-prefix OFDM on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Delay","Doppler effect","Receivers","Time-varying channels","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic-prefix OFDM","time-varying acoustic channels","sparse underwater acoustic channels","underwater acoustic communication","multicarrier transmission","intercarrier interference","compressive sensing","ICI","CalCom'10","data subcarriers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pilot-aided transmission","sparse channel estimation","basis pursuit","orthogonal matching pursuit","multicarrier transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Study of pilot designs for cyclic-prefix OFDM on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12207564","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of pilot designs for cyclic-prefix OFDM on time-varying and sparse underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Santander, Spain","sourcePdf":"110115057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127102S","chronDate":"6-9 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5977168","isNumber":"6003381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5977168","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6003381","articleId":"6003627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6003629,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

At present, thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) is widely used in handheld mobile devices. In terms of the overall system power consumption, TFT LCD power consumes 20%-45% of total system power due to different applications. The backlight of an LCD display dominates the power consumption of the whole system; controlling the backlight current to reduce the brightness and the contrast of LCDs can reduce the overall power consumption. However, this may cause significant changes in visual perception. In order to reduce the power consumption and eliminate the visual changes, the issue becomes: how to reduce the current by adjusting brightness and contrast in accordance with the current image. Based on content analysis, this paper proposes two new algorithms: the new backlight-dimming algorithm (NBDA) and the new image enhancement algorithm (NIEA). The proposed methods can, on average, simultaneously reduce power consumption by 47% and improve the image enhancement ratio by 6.8%. Moreover, the structural-similarity index metric (SSIM) is used to evaluate image quality.","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2011.2162314","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/6017213/06003725.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2011.2162314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-Based LCD Backlight Power Reduction With Image Contrast Enhancement Using Histogram Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003725/","displayDocTitle":"Content-Based LCD Backlight Power Reduction With Image Contrast Enhancement Using Histogram Analysis","volume":"7","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12353621","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003725/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-Based LCD Backlight Power Reduction With Image Contrast Enhancement Using Histogram Analysis","sourcePdf":"jdt-lai-2162314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054479S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"6017213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6017213","articleId":"6003725","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003726,"authors":[{"name":"Jayita Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6069922/6003726/6003726-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jayita Das (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa","Following her B.S. degree, she has worked as Scientist in Defense Research Development Organization, India, in the field of VLSI Design.

We have reported a novel spin-transfer torque current-induced clocking scheme, theoretically derived the clocking current, and shown the reduction in power consumption achieved against the traditional mechanism of clocking using magnetic fields typically generated from overhead or underneath wires. We have modeled the multi-layer cell behavior in Verilog-A along with the underlying algorithm used in implementing the neighbor interaction between the cells. This paper reports the switching and clocking current magnitudes, their direction and the power consumption associated with switching and clocking operation. Finally, we present the simulation results from Verilog-A model of switching, clocking and neighbor interaction. Low power consumption due to spin transfer torque current induced switching and clocking along with the reasonable magneto-resistance (MR) distinguishing the two energy minimum states of the device, make these devices a promising candidate in MQCA realization.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6069922/06003726.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2158344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2158344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata Realization Using Magnetic Multi-Layer Structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Switches","Magnetization","Magnetic tunneling","Torque","Computer architecture","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","logic circuits","low-power electronics","magnetic multilayers","nanoelectronics","nanomagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power magnetic quantum cellular automata","magnetic multilayer structures","tilted polarizer reference layer","single-domain nanomagnets","spin-transfer torque current-induced clocking","Verilog-A","clocking current magnitudes","neighbor interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power spin torque clocking","magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA)","magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","nanomagnetic logic","non-volatile logic","spintronic","Verilog-A model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low Power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata Realization Using Magnetic Multi-Layer Structures","volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6003726/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331850","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Magnetic Quantum Cellular Automata Realization Using Magnetic Multi-Layer Structures","sourcePdf":"jetcas-bhanja-2158344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082324S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"6003726","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003728,"authors":[{"name":"Ken-Ichi Kitayama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ken-Ichi Kitayama (S'75\u2013M'76\u2013SM'89\u2013F'03) received the B.E., M.E., and Dr.Eng. degrees in communication engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1974, 1976, and 1981, respectively.","In 1976, he joined the NTT Laboratory.

We review the potential threats, mainly loss of the confidentiality of user data transmitted through optical fibers and disturbances of network control, both of which could seriously damage the entire network. We then propose a novel conceptual model of a secure photonic network by introducing a quantum key distribution (QKD) network to its legacy structure. Secure keys generated by the QKD network are managed by key management agents (KMAs) and used to encrypt not only user data but also control signals. The KMAs cooperate with the generalized multiprotocol label-switching controller for secure path provisioning and drive photonic and modern crypto engines in appropriate combinations. Finally, we present a roadmap of a deployment scenario, starting from niche applications such as mission critical and business applications and the next. Digital cinema distribution through a photonic network is presented as an example of a niche application.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2166248","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6045636/06003728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2166248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045636","startPage":"3210","endPage":"3222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in Photonic Networks: Threats and Security Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Security in Photonic Networks: Threats and Security Enhancement","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12300689","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6003728/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in Photonic Networks: Threats and Security Enhancement","sourcePdf":"jlt-kitayama-2166248-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129371S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6045636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6045636","articleId":"6003728","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003729,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Different fiber types including standard single-mode fiber (SSMF), large effective area fiber (LEAF), and truewave classic fiber (TWC) are considered and compared. Our investigations show that the required number of simulated copropagating channels to correctly simulate the nonlinear penalty caused by interchannel nonlinearities on CP-QSPK modulation is strongly dependent on the fiber type. The generally used assumption of around ten channels for simulating interchannel nonlinearities is only valid for the SSMF with relative low channel input power. For transmission links consisting of fiber types with low dispersion or high nonlinear coefficients, such as the LEAF or TWC, ten copropagating channels are clearly not sufficient. In dispersion-managed systems with DCMs, the required number of simulated copropagating channels is not only dependent on fiber types and data rates but also strongly on PMD present in the links. Our investigations have indicated that for transmission over fibers with very low PMD (this is the case of most new fibers), ten copropagating channels are not sufficient to correctly characterize the interchannel nonlinearities even for high-dispersion fiber types, such as the SSMF, and hence causes a clear underestimation of the nonlinearity penalty. Finally, synchronized and interleaved CP-QPSK is compared. We show that despite the depolarization effect of PMD, there are still some benefits of using interleaved RZ-CP-QPSK systems.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2166250","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6045636/06003729.pdf","startPage":"3223","endPage":"3229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2166250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Channel Count and PMD on Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003729/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Channel Count and PMD on Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Transmission","volume":"29","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"12300702","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003729/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Channel Count and PMD on Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-xia-2166250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100086S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6045636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6045636","articleId":"6003729","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003732,"authors":[{"name":"Benton H.

However, the physical nature of BSNs introduces new challenges. The human body is a highly dynamic physical environment that creates constantly changing demands on sensing, actuation, and quality of service (QoS). Movement between indoor and outdoor environments and physical movements constantly change the wireless channel characteristics. These dynamic application contexts can also have a dramatic impact on data and resource prioritization. Thus, BSNs must simultaneously deal with rapid changes to both top-down application requirements and bottom-up resource availability. This is made all the more challenging by the wearable nature of BSN devices, which necessitates a vanishingly small size and, therefore, extremely limited hardware resources and power budget. Current research is being performed to develop new principles and techniques for adaptive operation in highly dynamic physical environments, using miniaturized, energy-constrained devices.

Many system operators around the world are challenged by the problems associated with integrating these intermittent resources into the grid. As one of the potential solutions, demand response (DR) is expected to play a major role for mitigating integration issues of intermittent renewable energy resources. In this context, this paper proposes a DR program which helps to integrate wind power by reshaping the load of the system. The DR program provides a framework to procure load reduction from DR resources in the wholesale energy market. The participants in the program submit their offer packages to provide load reduction in the day-ahead energy market. A day-ahead network-constrained market clearing formulation is also proposed which considers the load reduction provided by the DR program participants as an energy market commodity. The proposed method, which is in the mixed-integer linear programming format, determines commitment state of generating units, schedules the energy and spinning reserve provided by generating units, and schedules the load reduction provided by the DR program participants. To reveal the features of the proposed method, several numerical studies are conducted on the IEEE-RTS. The results presented indicate that integrating load reduction in the energy market provides a powerful tool to selectively modify the system load to support wind power integration, while making significant economic and technical benefits for the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003741/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6003741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543350","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Load Reduction Into Wholesale Energy Market With Application to Wind Power Integration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Load Reduction Into Wholesale Energy Market With Application to Wind Power Integration","sourcePdf":"jsyst-fotuhifiruzabad-2162877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119072S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6155170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6155170","articleId":"6003741","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6003753,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Dong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, P.

In the method, the error of the MoM matrix in the Frobenius norm can be expressed as a product of the error coefficient and the polynomial component. The error coefficient is insensitive to the positions of the frequency samples and the operating frequency, and hence it is practical to minimize the amplitude of the polynomial component rather than the error of matrix by optimizing the frequency samples. Actually, the amplitude of the polynomial component attains the minimum when the frequency samples are analytically expressed in terms of the roots of the Chebyshev polynomial of degree 4. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Moment methods","Extrapolation","Interpolation","Antennas","Transmission line matrix methods","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","extrapolation","interpolation","matrix algebra","method of moments","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cubic polynomial extrapolation method","MoM matrix","frequency sample optimisation","cubic polynomial interpolation method","method of moment matrix","Frobenius norm","polynomial component","Chebyshev polynomial"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extrapolation","frequency sample optimization","interpolation","method of moments (MoM) matrix"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2166239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/06003753.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2166239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy Improvement of Cubic Polynomial Inter/Extrapolation of MoM Matrices by Optimizing Frequency Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy Improvement of Cubic Polynomial Inter/Extrapolation of MoM Matrices by Optimizing Frequency Samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003753/","volume":"10","publicationDate":"2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003753/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12238821","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy Improvement of Cubic Polynomial Inter/Extrapolation of MoM Matrices by Optimizing Frequency Samples","sourcePdf":"lawp-li-2166239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044664S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"6003753","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6003761,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Zia-Chahabi","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Zia-Chahabi","id":"38270569500"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Le Bidan","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Rapha\u00ebl","lastName":"Le Bidan","id":"37661791800"},{"name":"Michel Morvan","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Morvan","id":"37297058700"},{"name":"Christophe Laot","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Laot","id":"37266691400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6003761","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1331},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We introduce a computationally efficient frequency-domain implementation of a fractionally spaced block-least-mean-square (LMS) or block-constant-modulus-algorithm (CMA) equalizer.

As new systems emerge and the demand for more accurate systems increases, it becomes necessary to better understand the effects of real or imperfect targets on the radiometric calibration results. Therefore, a point-target SAR simulator is presented which models the complete external radiometric calibration process. It incorporates a number of target properties like frequency response, transponder internal calibration strategies, noise, and interference signals, and it takes the instrument SAR mode settings into consideration. Thereby, the relevant target backscatter variation as observed in the processed SAR image with respect to an ideal or any other target can be determined. The simulation results are relevant during the design process of a new target as well as during the actual calibration of a SAR system. Based on these point-target simulations, correction coefficients can be stated for each target and SAR mode, therefore decreasing the remaining radiometric point-target uncertainties. The quantitative examples in this paper show that these corrections can influence the absolute radiometric calibration by more than 1 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference Target Correction Based on Point-Target SAR Simulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6155684/06003773.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Reference Target Correction Based on Point-Target SAR Simulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6003773/","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556257","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference Target Correction Based on Point-Target SAR Simulation","sourcePdf":"tgrs-doring-2162590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061694S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6155684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6155684","articleId":"6003773","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6003776,"authors":[{"name":"Frank van der Pijl","affiliation":["Electrical Sustainable Power Department, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/6003776/6003776-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank van der Pijl received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2003, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research is in the area of power electronics as applied in inductive energy transfer systems."]},"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"van der Pijl","id":"37564764300"},{"name":"Pavol Bauer","affiliation":["Electrical Sustainable Power Department, Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6296744/6003776/6003776-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Pavol Bauer (SM'07) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia, in 1985 and the Ph.D. degree from the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 1995.","He was a Professor (from the president of the Czech Republic) with the Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic, in 2008.

However, a higher frequency does not alter the magnetic coupling between energy transmitter and receiver. Due to the still weak magnetic coupling between transmitting and receiving sides that are separated by a substantial air gap, energy circulates in the primary transmitting side without being transferred to the secondary receiving side. This paper introduces an energy control method that reduces energy circulation in the primary to zero. The method makes use of the fact that energy can be stored in a magnetic field by the primary side and absorbed by the secondary side. Furthermore, the secondary side converter topology is modified in order to boost the damping as seen by the primary converter at required times. Essentially, the control method realizes an energetic coupling factor of one between the air coils of the wireless transformer. The working principle of the control method has been verified with an experimental setup.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","startPage":"382","endPage":"390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06003776.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Method for Wireless Inductive Energy Transfer Systems With Relatively Large Air Gap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6003776/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control Method for Wireless Inductive Energy Transfer Systems With Relatively Large Air Gap","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968351","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Method for Wireless Inductive Energy Transfer Systems With Relatively Large Air Gap","sourcePdf":"tie-bauer-2163917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06196S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6003776","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6003779,"authors":[{"name":"Tzung-Lin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6361304/6003779/6003779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tzung-Lin Lee (S'04\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Chung Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 1993, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2007.","From 1997 to 2001, he was with the Microwave Department, Electronics Research and Service Organization, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu.

This paper presents a control method for distributed static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM) to alleviate variation of both positive- and negative-sequence voltages. The D-STATCOM simultaneously operates as fundamental positive-sequence admittance and fundamental negative-sequence conductance to restore the positive-sequence voltage to the nominal value as well as reduce the negative-sequence voltage to an allowable level. Both admittance and conductance are dynamically tuned to improve voltage-regulation performances in response to load changes and power variation of renewable sources. A proportional-resonant current regulator with selectively harmonic compensation is realized to control the fundamental current of the D-STATCOM as well as reduce the harmonic current, which could be an advantage in practical applications due to high voltage distortion in low-voltage microgrids. Voltage-regulation performances are discussed for different D-STATCOM locations as well as different D-STATCOM currents.

The primary controller is designed based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to simulate the nonlinear characteristics of the system without knowledge of accurate motor models or parameters. The proposed motor drive decouples the torque and flux components of five-phase IPM motors by applying multiple-reference-frame transformation. Therefore, the motor can be easily driven below the rated speed with the maximum-torque-per-ampere operation or above the rated speed with the flux weakening operation. The ANN-based primary controller consists of a radial basis function network which is trained online to adapt system uncertainties. The complete IPM motor drive is simulated in Matlab/Simulink environment and implemented experimentally utilizing a dSPACE DS1104 controller board on a five-phase prototype IPM motor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6058663/06003782.pdf","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2163371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2163371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Reference Adaptive Control of Five-Phase IPM Motors Based on Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Permanent magnet motors","Reluctance motors","Torque","Motor drives","Adaptation models","Induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","machine control","motor drives","neurocontrollers","permanent magnet motors","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reference adaptive control","five-phase interior-permanent-magnet motor drives","artificial neural network","nonlinear characteristics","torque components","flux components","multiple-reference-frame transformation","maximum-torque-per-ampere operation","flux weakening operation","primary controller","radial basis function network","system uncertainties","Matlab-Simulink environment","dSPACE DS1104 controller board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model reference adaptive control (MRAC)","multiphase machines","neural network","permanent-magnet machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Model Reference Adaptive Control of Five-Phase IPM Motors Based on Neural Network","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6003782/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12315638","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Reference Adaptive Control of Five-Phase IPM Motors Based on Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tie-parsa-2163371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06219S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6058663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6058663","articleId":"6003782","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003784,"authors":[{"name":"Pak-Kin Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6063570/6003784/6003784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pak-Kin Wong received the M.S. degree in manufacturing systems engineering from the University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China, in 1997.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Head of the Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China.

This paper proposes two new approaches to modeling and compensating the rate-dependent hysteresis of a piezostage driven by piezoelectric stack actuators. By formulating the hysteresis modeling as an online nonlinear regression problem, online least squares support vector machine (SVM) (LS-SVM) and online relevance vector machine (RVM) models are proposed to capture the hysteretic behavior. Both hysteresis models are capable of updating continually with subsequent samples. After a comparative study on modeling performances, an inverse model-based feedforward combined with proportional-integral-derivative feedback control is presented to alleviate the hysteresis effect. Experimental results show that the LS-SVM model-based control scheme is over 86% more accurate than the RVM model-based one in the motion tracking task, whereas the latter is 14 times faster than the former in terms of updating time. Moreover, both LS-SVM and RVM model-based control schemes can suppress the rate-dependent hysteresis to a negligible level, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2166235","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6063570/06003784.pdf","startPage":"1988","endPage":"2001","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2166235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Dependent Hysteresis Modeling and Control of a Piezostage Using Online Support Vector Machine and Relevance Vector Machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Dependent Hysteresis Modeling and Control of a Piezostage Using Online Support Vector Machine and Relevance Vector Machine","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12328309","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6003784/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Dependent Hysteresis Modeling and Control of a Piezostage Using Online Support Vector Machine and Relevance Vector Machine","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2166235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089738S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6063570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6063570","articleId":"6003784","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":6003792,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6032791/6003792/6003792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guoxu Zhou was born in Hubei, China, in 1977.

We propose a method of estimating the APC in a probabilistic manner. Its probability distribution is obtained from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and hence represented with two parameters, i.e., mean and covariance. Based on the probability distribution of the APC, we calculate the power capacity that V2G regulation providers (or V2G aggregators) are contracted to provide grid operators with, called the contracted power capacity (CPC). Four possible contract types between a grid operator and a V2G regulation provider are suggested and, for each contract type, a profit function is developed from the APC and the penalty imposed to the V2G aggregator. The CPCs for four contract types are chosen to maximize the corresponding profit functions. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the estimated probability distribution of APC and the effectiveness of the profit functions.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2160299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6084801/06003809.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2160299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Achievable Power Capacity From Plug-in Electric Vehicles for V2G Frequency Regulation: Case Studies for Market Participation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003809/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Achievable Power Capacity From Plug-in Electric Vehicles for V2G Frequency Regulation: Case Studies for Market Participation","volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376610","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003809/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Achievable Power Capacity From Plug-in Electric Vehicles for V2G Frequency Regulation: Case Studies for Market Participation","sourcePdf":"tsg-han-2160299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06309S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6084801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"6084801","articleId":"6003809","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6003810,"authors":[{"name":"Chee-Wooi Ten","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6084801/6003810/6003810-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chee-Wooi Ten (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from Iowa State University, Ames, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University College Dublin, Ireland, in 2009.","He was an Application Engineer with Siemens Energy Management and Information System in Singapore from 2002 to 2006.

An anomaly inference algorithm is proposed for early detection of cyber-intrusions at the substations. The potential scenario of simultaneous intrusions launched over multiple substations is considered. The proposed detection method considers temporal anomalies. Potential intrusion events are ranked based on the credibility impact on the power system. Snapshots of anomaly entities at substations are described. Simulation results using the modified IEEE 118-bus system have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method for systematic identification.

It is very important to research the data mining strategy based on cloud computing from the theoretical view and practical view. In this paper, the strategy of mining association rules in cloud computing environment is focused on. Firstly, cloud computing, Hadoop, MapReduce programming model, Apriori algorithm and parallel association rule mining algorithm are introduced. Then, a parallel association rule mining strategy adapting to the cloud computing environment is designed. It includes data set division method, data set allocation method, improved Apriori algorithm, and the implementation procedure of the improved Apriori algorithm on MapReduce. Finally, the Hadoop platform is built and the experiment for testing performance of the strategy as well as the improved algorithm has been done. The results show that the strategy designed in this paper can archive higher efficiency when doing frequent item set mining in cloud computing environment.","doi":"10.1109/BCGIn.2011.125","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Computing and Global Informatization","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Business Computing and Global Informatization","pdfPath":"/iel5/6001752/6003816/06003927.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BCGIn.2011.125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6003816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6003927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Strategy of Mining Association Rule Based on Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6003927/","displayDocTitle":"The Strategy of Mining Association Rule Based on Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6003927/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12208014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Strategy of Mining Association Rule Based on Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"4464a475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040808S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6001752","isNumber":"6003816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6001752","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6003816","articleId":"6003927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6003981,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Tan","affiliation":["Information Systems and Decision Sciences Department, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Tan","id":"37896788100"},{"name":"Yongbeom Kim","affiliation":["Information Systems and Decision Sciences Department, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Madison, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yongbeom","lastName":"Kim","id":"37900335500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0788-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4464-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8941"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-895X"}],"articleNumber":"6003981","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1518},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Educational institutions","Google","Organizations","Software","Standards organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","educational computing","educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Google Docs","MBA group projects","educational institutions","critical success factors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Educational institutions","Google Docs","Critical Success Factor"]}],"abstract":"In this research, we classified the various applications of Cloud Computing technologies in educational institutions.

Drawing extensively on Burgin's mathematical theory of named sets, this new knowledge visualization treats all database content as ifit were scientific data, regardless of the database application. This mathematical tool penetrates deep into the logical structure of data and data relations, enabling a single algorithm to generate a conceptual knowledge structure, which pre-structures raw data in the database into a list of nested data-topic lists that works like a book index. For end-users, this visualization is familiar, convenient and precise. For the research community, this knowledge structure and the techniques used to build it offer an empirical tool for investigating the underlying properties of data, information, and knowledge on a computing device. The transformation from data to information to knowledge is automatic and seamless, thanks to a novel analysis of the logical structure of the symbols on these mechanical devices, one which reveals meta-symbols consisting of physical values(v) and constructed-types (t). The Database Taxonomy also provides a first glimpse into how navigating this structure can generate a predicate logic expression, an outcome which the author believes promises to advance our theoretical understanding of knowledge visualization and of the influence of a digital media on symbolic logic.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004000","publicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003377/6004000/06004061.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IV.2011.84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2011.84","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Knowledge Visualization of Database Content Created by a Database Taxonomy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004061/","displayDocTitle":"A Knowledge Visualization of Database Content Created by a Database Taxonomy","htmlLink":"/document/6004061/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12208136","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Knowledge Visualization of Database Content Created by a Database Taxonomy","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4476a323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057689S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003377","isNumber":"6004000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003377","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6004000","articleId":"6004061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6004062,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Bertschi","affiliation":["loginb consulting"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Bertschi","id":"37567242400"},{"name":"Sabrina Bresciani","affiliation":["Universit\u00e1 della Svizzera italiana (USI), Italy","Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana (USI)"],"firstName":"Sabrina","lastName":"Bresciani","id":"37546982400"},{"name":"Tom Crawford","affiliation":["VizNetwork, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Crawford","id":"37902830600"},{"name":"Randy Goebel","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37267398700"},{"name":"Wolfgang Kienreich","affiliation":["Know-Center, Austria","Know-Center"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Kienreich","id":"37546982800"},{"name":"Martin Lindner","affiliation":["Micro Web, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Lindner","id":"37897079900"},{"name":"Vedran Sabol","affiliation":["Know-Center, Austria","Know-Center"],"firstName":"Vedran","lastName":"Sabol","id":"37549965800"},{"name":"Andrew Vande Moere","affiliation":["KU Leuven"],"firstName":"Andrew Vande","lastName":"Moere","id":"37567251200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0868-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"}],"articleNumber":"6004062","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":567},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Context","Visual analytics","Media","Cognition","Rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge visualization","storytelling","visual thinking","PowerPoint"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004062","abstract":"This paper collates eight expert opinions about Knowledge Visualization, what it is and what it should be.

This emerging approach nevertheless builds on decades of research on using images collaboratively for sense making and knowledge sharing. In this paper, we review seminal concepts from different disciplines that help to explain how visualizations can effectively act as collaboration catalysts and knowledge integrators. Our review makes it apparent that many different labels and conceptions exist in very different domains to explain the same phenomenon: the integrative power of visuals for knowledge-intensive collaboration processes. These concepts can be used to compile a list of the requirements of an effective knowledge visualization.

Scholars are reporting successful company cases, theorizing on the topic and compiling classifications and best practices. Yet few studies have attempted to prove the effectiveness of visualization, nor have they based their hypotheses on theories with predictive power. We aim to provide a contribution for the advancement of the field of knowledge visualization by testing the effects of different visualizations on the attitude toward its content. Second, we assess if visualization effectiveness is universal or culturally-bounded. We have conducted an experimental study, comparing text and two knowledge visualization types. The results of 231 subjects in Europe and India demonstrate that knowledge visualization has the power to increase the effectives of the message compared to text, and that these benefits replicate across different cultures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004000","publicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003377/6004000/06004068.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IV.2011.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2011.29","startPage":"365","endPage":"370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effectiveness of Knowledge Visualization for Organizational Communication in Europe and India","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004068/","displayDocTitle":"The Effectiveness of Knowledge Visualization for Organizational Communication in Europe and India","htmlLink":"/document/6004068/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12208141","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effectiveness of Knowledge Visualization for Organizational Communication in Europe and India","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"4476a365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056611S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003377","isNumber":"6004000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003377","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6004000","articleId":"6004068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6004109,"authors":[{"name":"Youbing Zhao","affiliation":["Centre of Computer Graphics & Visualisation, University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Youbing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37535961200"},{"name":"Gordon J.

One of the most important challenges in participatory sensing is selecting the participants to collect their sensed data to monitor the environment. The goal here is to obtain the data of high quality with low payment from a predefined number of participants. To achieve the goal, this paper proposes a novel approach using the techniques of evolutionary algorithm. It models the goal as a multi-objective Knapsack problem, which is resolved by the hybrid scheme of Univariate Model Distribution Algorithm (UDMA) and the enhanced Third Evolution step of Generalized Differential Evolution (EGDE3).

A campus-wide Wi-Fi system, for example, requires a lot of VLANs for separating the access networks from other campus networks and for realizing a sophisticated access control such as guest-/home-users separation and security filtering. The requirement is high especially when a network roaming system, such as eduroam, is introduced. The conventional VLAN based on IEEE802.1Q has some limitations, and the system configuration work is laborious. In this paper, we propose a flexible campus VLAN system based on Open Flow to solve the problems. In addition, we introduce a prototype system and show evaluation results. As the results, we confirm that the proposed system can realize flexible network configurations and sophisticated access control with a much simplified network management work.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Authentication","Optical switches","Prototypes","IP networks","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","computer network management","computer network security","educational administrative data processing","virtual private networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible access management system","campus VLAN system","OpenFlow","campus networks","campus-wide Wi-Fi system","access control","guest-users separation","home-users separation","security filtering","network roaming system","eduroam","IEEE802.1Q","network management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["roaming","eduroam","OpenFlow","Network OS","access management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SAINT.2011.66","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003670/6004112/06004183.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT.2011.66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Access Management System for Campus VLAN Based on OpenFlow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Access Management System for Campus VLAN Based on OpenFlow","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004183/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004183/","accessionNumber":"12208777","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Access Management System for Campus VLAN Based on OpenFlow","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"4423a347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041078S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003670","isNumber":"6004112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003670","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6004112","articleId":"6004183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6004185,"authors":[{"name":"Yukiko Sawaya","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukiko","lastName":"Sawaya","id":"37427834400"},{"name":"Ayumu Kubota","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ayumu","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37286449400"},{"name":"Yutaka Miyake","affiliation":["KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Miyake","id":"37290507700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0531-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4423-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6004185","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Postal services","IP networks","Servers","Computer crime","Accuracy","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous host behavior","traffic flow statistics","flow-based service attacker detection method","malicious host detection","high-traffic network router","TCP ports","NetFlow","sFlow","deep packet inspection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flow-based attacker detection","NetFlow","spam mail sending hosts","DDoS attack","botnet"]}],"abstract":"Flow-based attacker detection is a common way to detect malicious hosts at a router on a high-traffic network with fewer computing resources. The most challenging aspect is to detect attackers that traverse well-known ports such as TCP ports 21, 25, 80, 443, etc. Although various methods have been studied, they cannot accurately detect such attackers. We propose a new flow-based attacker detection method that achieves a high detection rate using traffic flow statistics obtained by Net Flow, sFlow, etc. The proposed method focuses on the characteristics of attackers who send flows to both the object port and generally closed port in the global network. Our method accurately identifies hosts sending flows to object port as attackers, without any deep packet inspection. We evaluated our method using actually collected Net Flow data. The results show that it detects 90.0% of attackers, with few misidentifications of legitimate hosts.","doi":"10.1109/SAINT.2011.68","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003670/6004112/06004185.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT.2011.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Attackers in Services Using Anomalous Host Behavior Based on Traffic Flow Statistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004185/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Attackers in Services Using Anomalous Host Behavior Based on Traffic Flow Statistics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12208779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004185/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Attackers in Services Using Anomalous Host Behavior Based on Traffic Flow Statistics","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"4423a353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049902S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003670","isNumber":"6004112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003670","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6004112","articleId":"6004185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6004187,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuya Kishimoto","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Kishimoto","id":"37901219700"},{"name":"Hirofumi Yamaki","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Yamaki","id":"37839251100"},{"name":"Hiroki Takakura","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Takakura","id":"37063537900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0531-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4423-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6004187","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Internet","Electronic mail","Clustering algorithms","Training","Servers","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly based IDS","multiple classifiers","intrusion detection systems","cyber attacks","0-day attacks","learning dataset","Internet","Kyoto2006+"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection system","clustering","detection rate","false positive rate"]}],"abstract":"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play an important role to defend networks from cyber attacks.

In recent years, BP network has been used for pattern recognition. However, in practical application, BP has some disadvantage. The widely used BP algorithm has slow convergent speed and learning efficiency, and it is easy to get into local minimum. Selection of the initial value of the BP network can also affect convergent speed. This paper presents an improving BP network to accelerate convergence with genetic-simulated annealing algorithm. So, we optimized the initial value of the network through adding annealing idea into genetic algorithm(Genetic-stimulated annealing algorithm, GSA) to identify face direction. Using this improving BP neural network for the recognition of face direction, the results presents that our method has the highest precision and reaches relatively good effects compared with traditionally BP neural network.. Therefore, this method optimized with GSA poses better recognition ability, and achieves ideal effect for the face direction.","doi":"10.1109/ISCCS.2011.29","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003671/6004241/06004270.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"82","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Computer Science and Society","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Computer Science and Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCCS.2011.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving BP Neural Network for the Recognition of Face Direction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving BP Neural Network for the Recognition of Face Direction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12215362","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004270/","conferenceDate":"16-17 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving BP Neural Network for the Recognition of Face Direction","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4443a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042854S","chronDate":"16-17 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003671","isNumber":"6004241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003671","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6004241","articleId":"6004270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6004314,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Garcia-Dominguez","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Languages and Systems, University of C\u00e1diz, C\u00e1diz, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Garcia-Dominguez","id":"38275857700"},{"name":"Inmaculada Medina-Bulo","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Languages and Systems, University of C\u00e1diz, C\u00e1diz, Spain"],"firstName":"Inmaculada","lastName":"Medina-Bulo","id":"38277444000"},{"name":"Mariano Marcos-B\u00b4rcena","firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Marcos-B\u00b4rcena","id":"37087354190"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0754-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4468-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-662X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6002"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-6002"}],"articleNumber":"6004314","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Unified modeling language","Software algorithms","Software","Context","Electronic mail","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal verification","simulation languages","systems engineering","task analysis","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven design","performance requirements","error prone","time consuming process","complex workflows","slack distribution","task checking","model handling language","incremental algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["performance engineering","performance analysis","service level agreement","UML activity diagrams","workflows"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004314","doi":"10.1109/QSIC.2011.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2011.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004290","publicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on Quality Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 11th International Conference on Quality Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/6003376/6004290/06004314.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Design of Performance Requirements","abstract":"Obtaining the expected performance of a workflow is much simpler if the requirements for each of its tasks are well defined. However, most of the time, not all tasks have well-defined requirements, and these must be derived by hand. This can be an error-prone and time consuming process for complex workflows. In this work, we present an algorithm which can derive a time limit for each task in a workflow, using the available task and workflow expectations. The algorithm assigns the minimum time required by each task and distributes the slack according to the weights set by the user, while checking that the task and workflow expectations are consistent with each other. The algorithm avoids having to evaluate every path in the workflow by building its results incrementally over each edge. We have implemented the algorithm in a model handling language and tested it against a naive exhaustive algorithm which evaluates all paths. Our incremental algorithm reports equivalent results in much less time than the exhaustive algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004314/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12208074","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Design of Performance Requirements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Design of Performance Requirements","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"4468a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059427S","chronDate":"13-14 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6003376","isNumber":"6004290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6003376","xplore-issue":"6004290","articleId":"6004314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":6004424,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ezhou University, EZhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37900288200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0644-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6004424","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Reactive power","Optimization","Voltage control","Genetics","Investments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithm","reactive power compensation optimization model","power station","computer simulation","agricultural engineering optimization design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithm","Reactive power optimization\u0081COptimization design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004424","abstract":"Power station reactive power compensation optimization model has been optimized based on fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithm.

As the size of analyzed communities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be kept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) has the benefits of nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm. This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks) the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label. Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities compared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering coefficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12220775","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004645/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Community detection using a neighborhood strength driven Label Propagation Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Community detection using a neighborhood strength driven Label Propagation Algorithm","confLoc":"West Point, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"S09P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072986S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5987835","isNumber":"6004629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5987835","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6004629","articleId":"6004645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":6004655,"authors":[{"name":"Bita Azimdoost","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Bita","lastName":"Azimdoost","id":"38275162800"},{"name":"Hamid R.

Each node is assumed to have at least one local contact in each of the four directions of the plane in which the wireless network operates, and q(n) independent long-range social contacts forming its social group, one of which it selects randomly as its destination. The distance between source and the members of its social group follows a power-law distribution with parameter \u03b1, and communication between any two nodes takes place only within the physical transmission range; hence, source-destination communication takes place over multi-hop paths.

It is shown that the maximum order capacity is attained when \u03b1 \u2265 3, which makes social groups localized geographically, and that a wireless network can be scale-free when social groups are localized and independent of the number of nodes in the network, i.e., q(n) is independent of n.","doi":"10.1109/NSW.2011.6004655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSW.2011.6004655","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Network Science Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5987835/6004629/06004655.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Network Science Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of social groups on the capacity of wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"The impact of social groups on the capacity of wireless networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004655/","accessionNumber":"12220781","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004655/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of social groups on the capacity of wireless networks","confLoc":"West Point, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"S02P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112664S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5987835","isNumber":"6004629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5987835","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6004629","articleId":"6004655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6004688,"authors":[{"name":"Qinwen Fan","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Qinwen","lastName":"Fan","id":"37606236700"},{"name":"Johan Huijsing","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Huijsing","id":"37268708600"},{"name":"Kofi Makinwa","affiliation":["Technical University Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kofi","lastName":"Makinwa","id":"37294792500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0624-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0623-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0622-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6004688","dbTime":"48 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1048},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement errors","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["choppers (circuits)","electric current measurement","electric impedance measurement","feedback amplifiers","instrumentation amplifiers","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chopped multipath current feedback instrumentation amplifier","input impedance measurement","input bias measurement","offset current measurement","finite impedance source","measurement error","low noise Amplifier","common-mode rejection ratio","power supply rejection ratio","frequency 30 kHz","resistance 6 Mohm","current 102 pA","current 43 pA","voltage 2 muV","noise figure 134 dB","noise figure 120 dB"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents simulations and measurements of the input impedance, input bias and offset current of a chopped multi-path current feedback instrumentation amplifier.

This problem is further compounded in SRAM cells because SRAMs use devices that are among the smallest for a technology node. Since device degradation is a gradual process, it is proposed that if the threshold voltage increase in PMOS devices of SRAM cells can be monitored, failing cells in SRAMs can be detected and the SRAM can be operated without failures, given available memory redundancy. Using an experimentally verified NBTI model, we study the performances of conventional 6T SRAM cells, as a function of NBTI degradation, in the presence of process variations. An on-chip monitoring scheme is presented that can be embedded within conventional SRAM designs without affecting normal device operation. It identifies cells susceptible to read and write failures in the near future, enabling the prediction of cell failure before its occurrence in order to trigger reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/IWASI.2011.6004692","publicationTitle":"2011 4th IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Sensors and Interfaces (IWASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th IEEE

For networks with replenishment, conservative energy expenditure may lead to missed recharging opportunities due to battery capacity limitations, while aggressive usage of energy may result in reduced coverage or connectivity for certain time periods. Thus, new power allocation schemes need to be designed to balance these seemingly contradictory goals, in order to maximize sensor network performance. In this paper, we study the problem of how to jointly control the data queue and battery buffer to maximize the long-term average sensing rate of a wireless sensor network with replenishment under certain QoS constraints for the data and battery queues. We propose a unified algorithm structure and analyze the performance of the algorithm for all combinations of finite and infinite data and battery buffer sizes. We also provide a distributed version of the algorithm with provably efficient performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12639004","htmlLink":"/document/6004815/","displayDocTitle":"Near Optimal Power and Rate Control of Multi-Hop Sensor Networks With Energy Replenishment: Basic Limitations With Finite Energy and Data Storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near Optimal Power and Rate Control of Multi-Hop Sensor Networks With Energy Replenishment: Basic Limitations With Finite Energy and Data Storage","sourcePdf":"tac-mao-2166310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087503S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6174496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6174496","articleId":"6004815","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6004817,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Panagi","affiliation":["KIOS Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Networks, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Panagi","id":"37392214700"},{"name":"Marios M.

The subsystems exchange state information according to a tracking error based communication protocol, where each subsystem transmits its state information only when its tracking error exceeds a certain threshold.

Specifically, the proposed algorithms select two or three intermediate nodes to enhance security against the malicious eavesdropper. The first selected node operates in the conventional relay mode and assists the sources to deliver their data to the corresponding destinations using an amplify-and-forward protocol. The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases as jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the malicious eavesdropper. First, we find that in a topology where the intermediate nodes are randomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative jamming outperform the conventional nonjamming schemes within a certain transmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario where the intermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less effective than their nonjamming counterparts. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid scheme to switch between jamming and nonjamming modes. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that the hybrid switching scheme further improves the secrecy rate.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2166386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6126191/06004829.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2166386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection for Secure Two-Way Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection for Secure Two-Way Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004829/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12471624","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004829/","volume":"7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Relay and Jammer Selection for Secure Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-han-2166386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174199S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"6126191","articleId":"6004829","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6004839,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Grzonka","affiliation":["Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6145195/6004839/6004839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Slawomir Grzonka received the Master's degree in computer science from the University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, in June 2006.

While the ADPLL approach has already proven its benefits of power dissipation and cost reduction through the discrete-time operation and full RF-SoC integration in nanoscale CMOS, the coarse discretization of the phase detector function tends to keep it from reaching the ultimate of the RF performance potential. The proposed ADPLL features an arbitrarily high data rate modulation that is independent from the reference frequency. It is also made substantially free from injection pulling and ill-shaped quantization noise of the TDC by means of dithering with dynamic adjustment of differential pair mismatches as well as frequency translation of the feedback clock. Low power techniques, such as speculative clock retiming and asynchronous counter are used. The presented ADPLL is implemented in 65 nm CMOS as part of a single-chip GSM/EDGE RF-SoC. It occupies 0.35 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and consumes 32 mA of current at 1.2 V supply in the low frequency band.

A way of determining an optimal set of ADC thresholds to achieve the minimum bit-error rate (BER) is described, which can yield a very different set from the one that minimizes signal quantization errors. By recognizing that both the loop-unrolling DFE receiver and ADC-based DFE receiver decide each received bit based upon the result of a single slicer, an efficient architecture named reduced-slicer partial-response DFE (RS-PRDFE) receiver is proposed. The RS-PRDFE receiver eliminates redundant or unused slicers from the previous DFE receiver implementations. Both the simulation and measurement results from a 10 Gb/s ADC-based receiver fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology and multiple backplane channels demonstrate that the RS-PRDFE can achieve the BER of a 3-4-bit uniform ADC only with 4 data slicers. Also, the combined use of linear equalizers (LEs) can further reduce the required slicer count in RS-PRDFE receivers, but only when the LEs are realized in analog domain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","volume":"58","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12227983","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004849/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equalizer Design and Performance Trade-Offs in ADC-Based Serial Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalizer Design and Performance Trade-Offs in ADC-Based Serial Links","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kim-2162465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078761S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6016553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6016553","articleId":"6004849","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6004851,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Pennisi","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Sicilia, IT"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Pennisi","id":"37269876300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Scotti","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Sicilia, IT"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Scotti","id":"37271531600"},{"name":"Alessandro Trifiletti","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Sicilia, IT"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Trifiletti","id":"37271530500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"6004851","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","CMOS integrated circuits","Circuit theory","System-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit modeling","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain-bandwidth tradeoff","feedback amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"This paper discussed the comments on avoiding the gain-bandwidth tradeoff in feedback amplifiers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2162383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6016553/06004851.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2117","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2162383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reply to \"Comments on Avoiding the Gain-Bandwidth Trade Off in Feedback Amplifiers\"","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Reply to \"Comments on Avoiding the Gain-Bandwidth Trade Off in Feedback Amplifiers\"","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6004851/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227985","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reply to \"Comments on Avoiding the Gain-Bandwidth Trade Off in Feedback Amplifiers\"","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pennisi-2162383-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041329S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6016553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6016553","articleId":"6004851","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6004858,"authors":[{"name":"Yo-Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6041064/6004858/6004858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yo-Sheng Lin (M'02\u2013SM'06) was born in Puli, Taiwan, on October 10, 1969.

However, methods for trustworthy public verification of IP marks are not secure. For field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) designs, marks become prone to tampering, and even being overridden by an attacker's signature after public verification. In order to ensure trustworthy yet leakage-proof public verification based on the marks hidden in a FPGA design, we propose a zero-knowledge protocol Verify_ZKP. It is an interactive two-person game between the prover and the verifier. This protocol is fast, incurs no additional design overhead, and needs no centralized signature database. We establish that Verify_ZKP satisfies zero-knowledge property, and introduce statistical metrics to measure its robustness. We have simulated our protocol for IWLS'05 FPGA benchmarks.

An illustrative example is utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004878","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004878.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wiener model for memory high power amplifiers using B-spline function approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Wiener model for memory high power amplifiers using B-spline function approximation","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004878/","accessionNumber":"12216878","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004878/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wiener model for memory high power amplifiers using B-spline function approximation","confLoc":"Corfu","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049833S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6004887,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406752300"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0274-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"6004887","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004887","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Arrays","Optimization","Convergence","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["set-membership constrained conjugate gradient adaptive filtering algorithm","beamforming","linearly constrained minimum variance","LCMV beamformer","conjugate gradient method","low-complexity adaptive filtering algorithm","CG-based vector","matrix inversion","LCMV optimization problem","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Set-membership filtering","conjugate gradient algorithms","adaptive algorithms","beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004887","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-membership constrained conjugate gradient adaptive filtering algorithm and its application to beamforming","abstract":"We introduce a new linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer that combines the set-membership (SM) technique with the conjugate gradient (CG) method, and develop a low-complexity adaptive filtering algorithm for beamforming.

Many estimation algorithms exploit the time-domain correlation of the channel by employing Kalman Filter based on an approximation of the time-varying channel. A common method used in the literature is based on a first-order auto-regressive (AR1) model for the channel approximation, combined with a Correlation Matching (CM) criterion to fix the value of the AR1-parameter. In this paper, we propose first to replace the AR1 model by a specific second-order (Or2) model (as the one used for the phase estimation in presence of frequency offset), which is more appropriate for slow fading variations. Secondly, we propose a criterion based on the Minimization of the Asymptotic Variance (MAV) of the Kalman estimator to fix the parameter of the Or2-model. Closed-form expressions of the optimum Or2-parameter and of the corresponding Mean Square Error (MSE) are derived for a given channel state (Doppler spread, SNR). MSE theoretical analysis and simulation results prove a significant improvement with the Or2-MAV approach compared to more conventional AR1-CM approach (or even AR1-MAV optimized approach) in terms of MSE, especially for slow fading variations.","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004912.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-order modeling for Rayleigh flat fading channel estimation with Kalman Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Second-order modeling for Rayleigh flat fading channel estimation with Kalman Filter","htmlLink":"/document/6004912/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12216912","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-order modeling for Rayleigh flat fading channel estimation with Kalman Filter","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059675S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6004914,"authors":[{"name":"Jayash Koshal","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jayash","lastName":"Koshal","id":"38194259500"},{"name":"Angelia Nedi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Angelia","lastName":"Nedi\u0107","id":"38115746000"},{"name":"Uday V.

We consider one such instance in cognitive radio systems where recent efforts have focused on the application of game-theoretic approaches. Much of this work has been restricted to deterministic regimes and this paper considers a stochastic generalizations. The corresponding problems are seen to be stochastic Nash games over continuous strategy sets. Notably, the gradient map of player utilities is seen to be a monotone mapping over the cartesian product of strategy sets, leading to a monotone stochastic variational inequality. We consider the application of projection-based stochastic approximation schemes. However, such techniques are characterized by a key shortcoming in that the mappings were required to be be strongly monotone. Standard extensions of stochastic approximation schemes for merely monotone mappings rely on obtaining a sequence of increasingly exact solutions, a natively two-timescale scheme. However, obtaining solutions with increasing accuracy remains a challenging task in a simulation-based setting. Accordingly, we consider the development of single timescale techniques for computing equilibria when the associated gradient map does not admit strong monotonicity. We develop convergence theory for distributed single-timescale stochastic approximation schemes, namely stochastic iterative proximal point method which requires exactly one projection step at every step. Finally we apply this framework to the design of cognitive radio systems in uncertain regimes under temperature-interference constraints.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004914.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single timescale stochastic approximation for stochastic Nash games in cognitive radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004914/","displayDocTitle":"Single timescale stochastic approximation for stochastic Nash games in cognitive radio systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12216914","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single timescale stochastic approximation for stochastic Nash games in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060392S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6004928,"authors":[{"name":"Songbai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Songbai Wang","id":"37899732700"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jian Wang","id":"37406476300"},{"name":"Jianshu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianshu Chen","id":"37635067200"},{"name":"Xiuming Shan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiuming Shan","id":"37274690100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0274-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"6004928","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Transmitters","Estimation","Radar antennas","Receiving antennas","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","optimisation","probability","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal waveform design","MIMO radar","interception","low probability","promising multiple input multiple output radar","Kullback-Liebler divergence","KL divergence","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","interception","waveform design","information theory","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the waveform design problem of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar in the presence of an interceptor.

The error floor behavior is commonly attributed to the sub-optimality of iterative decoding algorithms on graphs with cycles, which become trapped to local minimum solutions. Trapping of the decoder depends on several factors, including the decoding algorithm. A particular received word that is not decoded by a certain algorithm may be decoded successfully by a different algorithm.

The proposed scheme is motivated by the fact that, since both the desired and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of the downlink system, the resulting interference can be influenced to reduce the transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the information content of the downlink message. This optimization aims at bringing the interference closer to the replica of the desired symbol in the modulo-extended constellation. By doing so, the quantized distance between the useful signal and interference is reduced and therefore the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased. Here, the above concept is applied to a practical THP design for multiple input multiple output systems (MIMO-THP). The results show a considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional THP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Tomlinson-Harashima precoding with interference optimization","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004953","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004953.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved Tomlinson-Harashima precoding with interference optimization","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004953/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12216953","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Tomlinson-Harashima precoding with interference optimization","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073374S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6004957,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The proposed estimator uses the definition of the multidimensional Fourier transform to obtain a frequency domain representation of the unevenly sampled signal. Using tensor algebra, the multidimensional frequency domain representation is then recast into matrix format and used in a weighted least squares (WLS) fitting criterion to iteratively obtain estimates of the spectral amplitudes and the covariance matrix.

We propose an acceleration technique for GEMM based on dynamically adjusting the precision of computation. Our technique employs DSP methods (such as scalar companding and rounding), followed by a new form of tight packing in floating-point that allows for concurrent calculation of multiple results. Since the companding process controls the increase of concurrency (via packing), the increase in processing throughput (and the corresponding loss in precision) depends on the input data statistics: low-variance parts of the matrix multiplication are computed faster than high-variance parts and the error is controlled in a stochastic and not in a worst-case sense. This can convert high-performance numerical DSP libraries into a computation channel where the output error increases when higher throughput is requested. Potential DSP applications that can benefit from the proposed approach are highlighted.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004973","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004973.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-precision computation for generic matrix multiplication: Toward a computation channel for high-performance digital signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-precision computation for generic matrix multiplication: Toward a computation channel for high-performance digital signal processing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12216973","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004973/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-precision computation for generic matrix multiplication: Toward a computation channel for high-performance digital signal processing","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064627S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6004974,"authors":[{"name":"Ghulam Muhammad","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ghulam","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37395625800"},{"name":"Muhammad Hussain","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37531877000"},{"name":"Khalid Khawaji","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Khawaji","id":"37889047200"},{"name":"George Bebis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, USA","College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Bebis","id":"37267262500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0274-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"6004974","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Discrete wavelet transforms","Noise","Forensics","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computer forensics","data analysis","image matching","image segmentation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind copy move image forgery detection","dyadic undecimated wavelet transform","DyWT","shift invariant","data analysis","approximation subband","detail subband","LL1 subband","HH1 subband","noise inconsistency","matched pairs","image thresholding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dyadic wavelets transform","copy-move","image forgery","image forensics"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a blind copy move image forgery detection method using dyadic wavelet transform (DyWT). DyWT is shift invariant and therefore more suitable than discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for data analysis. First we decompose the input image into approximation (LL1) and detail (HH1) subbands. Then we divide LL1 and HH1 subbands into overlapping blocks and measure the similarity between blocks. The key idea is that the similarity between the copied and moved blocks from the LL1 subband should be high, while the one from the HH1 subband should be low due to noise inconsistency in the moved block. We sort pairs of blocks based on high similarity using the LL1 subband and high dissimilarity using the HH1 subband. Using thresholding, we obtain matched pairs from the sorted list as copied and moved blocks. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over competitive methods using DWT and the LL1 or HH1 subbands only.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004974","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind copy move image forgery detection using dyadic undecimated wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind copy move image forgery detection using dyadic undecimated wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004974/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12216974","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004974/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind copy move image forgery detection using dyadic undecimated wavelet transform","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063544S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6004983,"authors":[{"name":"Eduard A.

The score-based, maximum throughput, and proportional fair scheduler do not lead necessarily to a stable matching. We apply the user and resource proposing deferred acceptance algorithm in order to find stable matchings and to identify their properties. If the preference lists of users and resources are strict and based on the same information, e.g., the channel state, the stable matching is always unique. The optimality properties of stable matchings are characterized.

The formulation contains constraints on the transmit power (and possibly spectral masks) as well as (probabilistic) average interference tolerable at the primary receivers. A new decision model for energy detectors that is robust against device-level uncertainties and system-level uncertainties is also proposed. The resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex, which presents a new challenge for the analysis of this class of Nash games that cannot be addressed using mathematical tools from the game theory literature. To deal with the nonconvexity of the game, we introduce new relaxed equilibrium concepts, the Quasi-Nash Equilibrium (QNE) and Local Nash Equilibrium (LNE) and study the main properties of these equilibria, their connection, and their performance. Quite interestingly, the proposed joint optimization of the sensing and transmission parameters is shown to yield a considerable performance improvement with respect to current designs of CR systems, which validates the proposed new concept of QNE.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004984","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06004984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6004984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint sensing and power allocation in nonconvex cognitive radio games: Quasi-nash equilibria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6004984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint sensing and power allocation in nonconvex cognitive radio games: Quasi-nash equilibria","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004984/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12216984","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6004984/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint sensing and power allocation in nonconvex cognitive radio games: Quasi-nash equilibria","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087205S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6004992,"authors":[{"name":"Fok Hing Chi Tivive","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Fok Hing Chi","lastName":"Tivive","id":"37297349100"},{"name":"Moeness G.

It is shown that the truncated censored sensing approach is highly energy efficient, particularly when the sensing cost is high.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6004996/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12216996","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6004996/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Censored truncated sequential spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Censored truncated sequential spectrum sensing for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060478S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6004996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005003,"authors":[{"name":"Dyonisius Dony Ariananda","affiliation":["Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Dyonisius Dony","lastName":"Ariananda","id":"37391709300"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"},{"name":"Zhi Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Tian","id":"37278997500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0274-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0273-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0272-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"}],"articleNumber":"6005003","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1056},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicoset sampling","power spectrum blind sensing","reconstruction method","random signal","sub-Nyquist-rate samples","minimal sparse ruler problem","coprime sampling technique","auto-correlation lags","sparsity constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-coset sampling","sparse ruler","coprime sampling"]}],"abstract":"Power spectrum blind sampling (PSBS) consists of a sampling procedure and a reconstruction method that is able to recover the unknown power spectrum of a random signal from the obtained sub-Nyquist-rate samples. It differs from spectrum blind sampling (SBS) that aims to recover the spectrum instead of the power spectrum of the signal. In this paper, a PSBS solution is first presented based on a periodic sampling procedure. Then, a multi-coset implementation for this sampling procedure is developed by solving the so-called minimal sparse ruler problem, and the coprime sampling technique is tailored to fit into the PSBS framework as well. It is shown that the proposed multi-coset implementation based on minimal sparse rulers offers advantages over coprime sampling in terms of reduced sampling rates, increased flexibility and an extended range of estimated auto-correlation lags. These benefits arise without putting any sparsity constraint on the power spectrum. Application to sparse power spectrum recovery is also illustrated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6005003","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06005003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6005003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-coset sampling for power spectrum blind sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-coset sampling for power spectrum blind sensing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217003","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005003/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-coset sampling for power spectrum blind sensing","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6005003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6005006,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Ying Liu","id":"37898536200"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Ming Li","id":"37404560500"},{"name":"Kanke Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Kanke","lastName":"Gao","id":"37391929000"},{"name":"Dimitris A.

When all CR links can not be active at the same time due to excessive interference, an admission control mechanism is necessary to schedule the CR links. Key to both tasks is accurate knowledge of the CR-to-PU channel gains. However, CRs generally face difficulties in estimating the channel gains very accurately, often due to lack of explicit support from the PU systems. In this work, admission and power control algorithms are developed to account for channel uncertainty through probabilistic interference constraints. Both log-normal shadowing and small-scale fading effects are considered through suitable approximations. The resulting problems can be solved via sequential geometric programming. The admission control is based on solving feasibility problems, whereby CR links violating the interference constraints the most are dropped progressively. The feasible point thus found to initialize the power control iterative solver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005012/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12217012","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005012/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Admission and power control for cognitive radio networks by sequential geometric programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Admission and power control for cognitive radio networks by sequential geometric programming","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15387S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6005012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005014,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Moser","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), Gabriele Moser and Sebastiano B.

In particular, we study the problem of pilot assisted channel estimation in wideband OFDM systems, where the time-domain (discrete) channel is approximately sparse. Existing works on this topic established that techniques from the compressed sensing literature can yield accurate channel estimates using a relatively small number of pilot tones, provided the pilots are selected randomly. Here, we describe a general purpose procedure for deterministic selection of pilot tones to be used for channel estimation, and establish guarantees for channel estimation accuracy using these sequences along with recovery techniques from the compressed sensing literature. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983340/6004864/06005024.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2011 17th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6005024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2011.6005024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deterministic pilot sequences for sparse channel estimation in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Signal to noise ratio","Indium phosphide","Polynomials","Barium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic pilot sequence","sparse channel estimation","multipath channel estimation","single-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","pilot assisted channel estimation","wideband OFDM system","time-domain channel","deterministic selection","channel estimation accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","compressed sensing","deterministic RIP matrices","OFDM systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Deterministic pilot sequences for sparse channel estimation in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217024","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deterministic pilot sequences for sparse channel estimation in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"dsp2011submission229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070386S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983340","isNumber":"6004864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983340","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6004864","articleId":"6005024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005033,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Resta","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Resta","id":"37888938800"},{"name":"Nicola Acito","affiliation":["Dipartimento Armi Navali, Accademia Navale, Livorno, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Acito","id":"37269420400"},{"name":"Marco Diani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Diani","id":"37269423000"},{"name":"Giovanni Corsini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Corsini","id":"37269421300"},{"name":"Thomas Opsahl","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Opsahl","id":"37708196000"},{"name":"Trym Vegard Haavardsholm","affiliation":["Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Trym Vegard","lastName":"Haavardsholm","id":"37393303400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1203-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1201-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005033","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Spatial resolution","Vehicles","Accuracy","Sensors","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","Global Positioning System","image registration","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne hyperspectral image detection","urban areas","airborne sensors","direct georeferencing method","gyro data analysis","GPS position","image registration","urban scenario analysis","real hyperspectral data","high spatial resolution","change detection strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change Detection","Hyperspectral Imagery","Urban area"]}],"abstract":"In this work we investigate the problem of detecting small changes in images acquired by airborne sensors, using direct georeferencing from gyro data and GPS position. We intend to avoid the time consuming step of image registration, exploiting direct georeferencing cascaded with a robust change detection strategy that can properly manage the typical registration errors given by onboard instrumentation. We investigate the effectiveness of this approach in the urban scenarios, where we are interested in detecting changes induced by small objects. The experimental analysis conducted on real hyperspectral data with very high spatial resolution highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach, resulting in a consistent improvement of both the capability of detecting changes and of suppressing the background.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of small changes in airborne hyperspectral imagery: Experimental results over urban areas","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Images (Multi-Temp)","doi":"10.1109/Multi-Temp.2011.6005033","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Images (Multi-Temp)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5983499/6005026/06005033.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Multi-Temp.2011.6005033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of small changes in airborne hyperspectral imagery: Experimental results over urban areas","conferenceDate":"12-14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005033/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of small changes in airborne hyperspectral imagery: Experimental results over urban areas","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"202DetectionofSmallChangesinAirborneHyperspec.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105578S","chronDate":"12-14 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5983499","isNumber":"6005026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5983499","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6005026","articleId":"6005033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6005061,"authors":[{"name":"Aleixandre Verger","affiliation":["INRA, UMR114, EMMAH, Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon, Avignon, France","Departament de F\u00edsica de la Terra i Termodin\u00e0mica, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Aleixandre","lastName":"Verger","id":"37841563400"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baret","affiliation":["INRA, UMR114, EMMAH, Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Baret","id":"37266889800"},{"name":"Marie Weiss","affiliation":["INRA, UMR114, EMMAH, Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37432937700"},{"name":"Sivasathivel Kandasamy","affiliation":["INRA, UMR114, EMMAH, Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Sivasathivel","lastName":"Kandasamy","id":"38313001400"},{"name":"Eric Vermote","affiliation":["Department of Geography, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Vermote","id":"37354735600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1203-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1201-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005061","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"abstract":"Scaling variations and shifts in the timing of seasonal phenology are central features of global change research. In this study, we propose a novel climatology fitting approach to quantify inter-annual anomalies in LAI seasonality. A consistent archive of daily LAI estimates was first derived from historical AVHRR satellite data for the 1981-2000 period over a globally representative sample of sites. The climatology values were then computed by averaging multi-year LAI profiles, gap filling and smoothing to eliminate possible high temporal frequency residual artifacts. The inter-annual variations in LAI were finally quantified by scaling and shifting the seasonal climatological patterns to the actual observations. In addition to capturing LAI dynamics and quantifying anomalies, this climatology fitting approach allows improving the continuity and consistency of time series by filling gaps and smoothing LAI dynamics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Images

this letter, we design downlink beamforming vectors for a multicell network when only imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at both base stations (BS) and mobile users (MU). We consider two different optimization criteria, i.e., minimizing the total downlink transmit power subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints at each MU and maximizing the worst-case effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) subject to BS power constraints. To solve the optimization problems, the imperfect CSI embedded QoS constraints are converted to linear matrix inequalities (LMI) with the aid of S-procedure, and then a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach is applied. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317862","htmlLink":"/document/6005188/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell Downlink Beamforming with Imperfect Channel Knowledge at Both Transceiver Sides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell Downlink Beamforming with Imperfect Channel Knowledge at Both Transceiver Sides","sourcePdf":"1075-cl1110-ponuk.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042535S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6061509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6061509","articleId":"6005188","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005189,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Mohammadkarimi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, K.N.

A final behavior is a set of selected parts of expressions. It is possible to not only reveal an abundance of expressions without one-to-one mapping relations between emotions and behaviors but also apply these expressions in the case of various robots.

Using the frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar technique with a nearly 30 GHz bandwidth, sub-centimeter range resolution is achieved. To optimize the radar's range resolution, a reliable software calibration procedure compensates for signal distortion from radar waveform nonlinearities. Low-noise, high dynamic range detection comes from the radar's heterodyne RF architecture, low-noise chirp source, and high-performance 675 GHz transceiver. The radar's optical design permits low-distortion fast beam scanning for single-pixel imaging, and a real-time radar image frame rate of 1 Hz is now possible. Still faster speeds are on the horizon as multi-beam THz transceivers are developed.","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159556","startPage":"169","endPage":"182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503871/6005317/06005328.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THz Imaging Radar for Standoff Personnel Screening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"THz Imaging Radar for Standoff Personnel Screening","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12216078","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005328/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THz Imaging Radar for Standoff Personnel Screening","sourcePdf":"tthz-cooper-2159556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160537S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6005317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"467","xplore-issue":"6005317","articleId":"6005328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6005329,"authors":[{"name":"William Deal","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Redondo Beach, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6005317/6005329/6005329-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["William Deal (M'96\u2013SM'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","Currently, he is a Senior Department Staff Engineer at Northrop Grumman's RF Product Center, Redondo Beach, CA.

This paper explores the progress towards practical development of the technology and the physical basis of the challenges involved in creating a deployable person-borne IED detection system. We conclude that, despite the theoretical potential of terahertz to provide a safe, through-barrier spectroscopic detection technique, this is unlikely to be possible in practice. The relatively weak and broad explosives features tend to be masked by the combined effects of atmospheric water vapor absorption, barrier attenuation and scattering from both clothing and the target explosives. Imaging at the lower end of the terahertz frequency range, although not offering the same specificity, is a more promising technique for security applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503871/6005317/06005335.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159647","startPage":"282","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explosives Detection by Terahertz Spectroscopy\u2014A Bridge Too Far?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005335/","displayDocTitle":"Explosives Detection by Terahertz Spectroscopy\u2014A Bridge Too Far?","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005335/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12216085","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explosives Detection by Terahertz Spectroscopy\u2014A Bridge Too Far?","sourcePdf":"tthz-kemp-2159647-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148986S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6005317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6005317","articleId":"6005335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005336,"authors":[{"name":"Craig Kulesa","affiliation":["Steward Observatory, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Craig Kulesa received the Ph.D. degree in astronomy from the University of Arizona, Tucson, in 2002 and currently serves there as an Assistant Astronomer."]},"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Kulesa","id":"37563523300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-342X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-3446"}],"articleNumber":"6005336","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1719},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Solar system","Extraterrestrial measurements","Planets","Telescopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical techniques","comets","cosmology","galaxies","star formation","terahertz waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terahertz spectroscopy","comets","cosmology","electromagnetic spectrum","largely-unexplored wavelength frontier","astronomical observation","spectral signatures","solar system","star formation","galaxies","cosmic timescales","terahertz instrumentation","extragalactic astronomy","terahertz radiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extragalactic astronomy","galactic astronomy","gas spectroscopy","heterodyne instruments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005336","abstract":"The terahertz portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is perhaps the last largely-unexplored wavelength frontier for astronomical observations.

We start out by introducing a novel waveguide-based all-electronic imaging system which operates at 812 GHz. Its salient feature is a 32-pixel linear detector array heterodyne-operated at the eighth subharmonic. This array in combination with a telescope optics for object distances of 2-6 m reaches a data acquisition speed suited for real-time imaging. The second system described then is again an all-electronic scanner (now for around 300 GHz ), designed for object distances of \u2265 8 m , which combines mechanical scanning in vertical direction, synthetic-aperture image generation in horizontal direction, and frequency-modulated continuous-wave sweeping for the depth information. The third and fourth systems follow an optoelectronic approach by relying on several- to multi-pixel parallel electrooptic detection. One imager is based on a pulsed THz-OPO and homodyne detection with a CCD camera, the other on either continuous-wave electronic or femtosecond optoelectronic THz sources and a photonic-mixing device (PMD) camera. The article concludes with a description of the state of the art of imaging with focal-plane arrays based on CMOS field-effect transistors.","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2159559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503871/6005317/06005341.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THz Active Imaging Systems With Real-Time Capabilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"THz Active Imaging Systems With Real-Time Capabilities","volume":"1","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005341/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216091","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THz Active Imaging Systems With Real-Time Capabilities","sourcePdf":"tthz-roskos-2159559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1796S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6005317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"6005317","articleId":"6005341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6005342,"authors":[{"name":"Lorene A.

With more and more people using wireless networks, the demand for the ultra-fast wireless communications systems is increasing. To date, this demand has been accommodated with advanced modulation schemes and signal-processing technologies at microwave frequencies. However, without increasing the carrier frequencies for more spectral resources, it may be quite difficult to keep up with the needs of users. Although there are several alternative bands, recent advances in terahertz-wave (THz-wave) technologies have attracted attention due to the huge bandwidth of THz waves and its potential for use in wireless communications. The frequency band of 275 ~ 3000 GHz , which has not been allocated for specific uses yet, is especially of interest for future wireless systems with data rates of 10 Gb/s or higher. Although THz communications is still in a very early stage of development, there have been lots of reports that show its potential. In this review, we will examine the current progress of THz-wave technologies related to communications applications and discuss some issues that need to be considered for the future of THz communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12216093","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005345/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Present and Future of Terahertz Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Present and Future of Terahertz Communications","sourcePdf":"tthz-song-2159552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108859S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6005317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"664","xplore-issue":"6005317","articleId":"6005345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6005347,"authors":[{"name":"Koichiro Tanaka","affiliation":["CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan","Institute of Integrated Cell-Material Sciences and Department of Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6005317/6005347/6005347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Koichiro Tanaka was born in 1962 in Sapporo, Japan, and received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1985 and 1990, respectively.","He was a Research Associate at the Institute for Solis State Physics (ISSP), University of Tokyo, from 1990 to 1995, and joined the \u201cHirao-Active-Glass Project\u201d at Kyoto (1995\u20131997).

To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that can capture the general performance properties for a class of multicore processors of interest over a large design space and workload space, free of scalability issues. The idea is to model multicore processors at the thread-level, overlooking instruction-level and micro architectural details. In particular, queuing network models that model multicore processors at the thread level are developed and solved based on an iterative procedure over a large design space and workload space. This framework scales to virtually unlimited numbers of cores and threads. The testing of the procedure demonstrates that the throughput performance for many-core processors with 1000 cores can be evaluated within a few seconds on an Intel Pentium 4 computer and the results are within 5% of the simulation data obtained based on a thread-level simulator.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6004863/6005352/06005353.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.21","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.21","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Mathematical model","Servers","Multicore processing","Analytical models","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration","manycore processors","workload space","multicore era","optimal design","multicore processor design","programming phase","scalability issues","instruction-level","micro architectural details","queuing network","iterative procedure","Intel Pentium 4 computer","thread-level simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["design space exploration","multicore","CMP","manycore","queuing network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005353/","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Framework for Design Space Exploration of Manycore Processors","accessionNumber":"12215461","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005353/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Framework for Design Space Exploration of Manycore Processors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075095S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005357,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Moeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Moeng","id":"37697658800"},{"name":"Sangyeun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Sangyeun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293575700"},{"name":"Rami Melhem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Melhem","id":"37273234900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0468-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"6005357","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Instruction sets","Synchronization","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","multi-threading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable multicache simulation","software simulation","processor design","analytical model","important evaluation step","chip fabrication","cycle-accurate simulator","parallel simulation","multithreaded simulator","simulation accelerator","coarse-grained parallelism","FPGA-based simulator","fine-grained parallelism","trace-driven many-cache simulator","NVIDIA","CUDA toolkit","GPU-accelerated cache simulation display","serial CPU-only simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simulation","Parallel Architecture","Cache","General-Purpose GPU","CUDA"]}],"abstract":"Software simulation is the primary tool used for evaluation of processor design. Simulation offers better accuracy than analytical models and is an important evaluation step before actually fabricating a chip. Unfortunately, simulator speeds are slow -- a conventional cycle-accurate simulator will be unable to keep up with increasing core counts in modern processor design. Parallel simulation is one method for improving simulation speeds. Two major areas of parallel simulation research are multithreaded simulators and FPGAs as simulation accelerators. Multithreaded simulators can only extract coarse-grained parallelism and must sacrifice accuracy in order to scale well. FPGA-based simulators can extract fine-grained parallelism, but are expensive and difficult to program. We propose using GPUs for architectural simulation, which can take advantage of a high degree of fine-grained parallelism. In addition, they are inexpensive and easier to program compared to FPGAs. To demonstrate our ideas, we implement a trace-driven many-cache simulator using NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit. GPU-accelerated cache simulation displays remarkable scaling with number of simulated caches when compared to serial CPU-only simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Multi-cache Simulation Using GPUs","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.24","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6004863/6005352/06005357.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Multi-cache Simulation Using GPUs","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005357/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215465","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Multi-cache Simulation Using GPUs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058719S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005358,"authors":[{"name":"Soyoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37337209100"},{"name":"Hyokyung Bahn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyokyung","lastName":"Bahn","id":"37398723300"},{"name":"Sam H.

However, PCM has two critical weaknesses to substitute DRAM memory in its entirety. First, the number of write operations allowed to each PCM cell is limited. Second, write access time of PCM is about 6-10 times slower than that of DRAM. To cope with this situation, hybrid memory architectures that use a small amount of DRAM together with PCM memory have been suggested. In this paper, we present a new memory management technique for hybrid PCM and DRAM memory architecture that efficiently hides the slow write performance of PCM. Specifically, we aim to estimate future write references accurately and then absorb most memory writes into DRAM. To do this, we analyze the characteristics of memory write references and find two noticeable phenomena. First, using write history alone performs better than using both read and write history in estimating future write references. Second, the frequency characteristic is a better estimator than temporal locality but combining these two properties appropriately leads to even better results.

The customers can dynamically provision virtual servers (i.e., computing instances) in EC2, and then the customers are charged by Amazon on a pay-per-use basis. EC2 offers three options to provision virtual servers, i.e., on-demand, reservation, and spot options. Each option has different price and yields different benefit to the customers. Spot price (i.e., price of spot option) could be the cheapest, however, the spot price is fluctuated and even more expensive than the prices of on-demand and reservation options due to supply-and-demand of available resources in EC2. Although the reservation and on-demand options have stable prices, their costs are mostly more expensive than that of spot option. The challenge is how the customers efficiently purchase the provisioning options under uncertainty of price and demand. To address this issue, two virtual server provisioning algorithms are proposed to minimize the provisioning cost for long- and short-term planning. Stochastic programming, robust optimization, and sample-average approximation are applied to obtain the optimal solutions of the algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, numerical studies are extensively performed. The results show that the algorithms can significantly reduce the total provisioning cost incurred to customers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12215479","htmlLink":"/document/6005371/","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cost Minimization for Provisioning Virtual Servers in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost Minimization for Provisioning Virtual Servers in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076235S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6005376,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37899556100"},{"name":"Yifeng Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, USA"],"firstName":"Yifeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37696218200"},{"name":"Jianhui Yue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, USA"],"firstName":"Jianhui","lastName":"Yue","id":"37688621000"},{"name":"Zhao Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, USA"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Cai","id":"37690107300"},{"name":"Bruce Segee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Segee","id":"37354307400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0468-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"6005376","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":482},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hard disks","Resource management","Servers","Algorithm design and analysis","Electronic mail","Calculators","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","hard discs","knapsack problems","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hot random off-loading","dynamic data migration","hard disk drives","self-optimizing hybrid storage system","random I/O access","history access patterns","0-1 knapsack model","file systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ssd","hybrid storage","data migration"]}],"abstract":"Random accesses are generally harmful to performance in hard disk drives due to more dramatic mechanical movement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Hot Random Off-loading (HRO), a self-optimizing hybrid storage system that uses a fast and small SSD as a by-passable cache to hard disks, with a goal to serve a majority of random I/O accesses from the fast SSD. HRO dynamically estimates the performance benefits based on history access patterns, especially the randomness and the hotness, of individual files, and then uses a 0-1 knapsack model to allocate or migrate files between the hard disks and the SSD. HRO can effectively identify files that are more frequently and randomly accessed and place these files on the SSD. We implement a prototype of HRO in Linux and our implementation is transparent to the rest of the storage stack, including applications and file systems. We evaluate its performance by directly replaying three real-world traces on our prototype. Experiments demonstrate that HRO improves the overall I/O throughput up to 39% and the latency up to 23%.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.41","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6004863/6005352/06005376.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot Random Off-Loading: A Hybrid Storage System with Dynamic Data Migration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005376/","displayDocTitle":"Hot Random Off-Loading: A Hybrid Storage System with Dynamic Data Migration","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005376/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215484","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot Random Off-Loading: A Hybrid Storage System with Dynamic Data Migration","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054629S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005383,"authors":[{"name":"Yanpei Chen","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Yanpei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407082900"},{"name":"Archana Ganapathi","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Archana","lastName":"Ganapathi","id":"37273444500"},{"name":"Rean Griffith","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Rean","lastName":"Griffith","id":"37426418500"},{"name":"Randy Katz","affiliation":["University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Katz","id":"37278290900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0468-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"6005383","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":215,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Production","Aggregates","Transforms","Facebook","Vocabulary","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","parallel processing","pattern clustering","performance evaluation","processor scheduling","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MapReduce performance evaluation","workload suites","large-scale MapReduce cluster management","workload-specific performance","MapReduce benchmark","MapReduce workload","workload-specific resource bottlenecks","MapReduce task scheduler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","performance","workload","benchmark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005383","abstract":"MapReduce systems face enormous challenges due to increasing growth, diversity, and consolidation of the data and computation involved.

We analyze and compare two production MapReduce traces to develop a vocabulary for describing MapReduce workloads. We show that existing benchmarks fail to capture rich workload characteristics observed in traces, and propose a framework to synthesize and execute representative workloads. We demonstrate that performance evaluations using realistic workloads gives cluster operator new ways to identify workload-specific resource bottlenecks, and workload-specific choice of MapReduce task schedulers. We expect that once available, workload suites would allow cluster operators to accomplish previously challenging tasks beyond what we can now imagine, thus serving as a useful tool to help design and manage MapReduce systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005352","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6004863/6005352/06005383.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.12","startPage":"390","endPage":"399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case for Evaluating MapReduce Performance Using Workload Suites","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005383/","displayDocTitle":"The Case for Evaluating MapReduce Performance Using Workload Suites","htmlLink":"/document/6005383/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12215491","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case for Evaluating MapReduce Performance Using Workload Suites","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098896S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005391,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjae Kim","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Youngjae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37066715800"},{"name":"Aayush Gupta","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Aayush","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37897189300"},{"name":"Bhuvan Urgaonkar","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Bhuvan","lastName":"Urgaonkar","id":"37404034800"},{"name":"Piotr Berman","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Berman","id":"37278579900"},{"name":"Anand Sivasubramaniam","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Sivasubramaniam","id":"37273174700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0468-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1526-7539"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0227"}],"articleNumber":"6005391","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1044},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005391","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Ash","Capacity planning","Random access memory","Equations","Throughput","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","DRAM chips","hard discs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HybridStore","high-performance storage system","SSD","DRAM","caching","buffering","idiosyncrasy","flash memory","storage hierarchy","hybrid system","HybridPlan","HybridDyn","write-regulation","fragmentation busting","cost-effective storage configuration","HDD-based system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flash Memory","Storage Systems","Modeling","Capacity Planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.64","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 19th Annual International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6004863/6005352/06005391.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HybridStore: A Cost-Efficient, High-Performance Storage System Combining SSDs and HDDs","abstract":"Unlike the use of DRAM for caching or buffering, certain idiosyncrasies of SSDs make their integration into existing systems non-trivial. Flash memory suffers from limits on its reliability, is an order of magnitude more expensive than the HDD, and can sometimes be as slow as the HDD (due to excessive garbage collection (GC) induced by high intensity of random writes). Given these trade-offs between HDDs and SSDs in terms of cost, performance, and lifetime, the current consensus among several storage experts is to view SSDs not as a replacement for HDD but rather as a complementary device within the high performance storage hierarchy. We design and evaluate such a hybrid system called Hybrid Store to provide: (a) Hybrid Plan: improved capacity planning technique to administrators with the overall goal of operating within cost-budgets and (b) HybridDyn: improved performance/lifetime guarantees during episodes of deviations from expected workloads through two novel mechanisms: write-regulation and fragmentation busting. As an illustrative example of HybridStore's efficacy, Hybrid Plan is able to find the most cost-effective storage configuration for a large scale workload of Microsoft Research and suggest one MLC SSD with ten 7.2K RPM HDDs instead of fourteen 7.2K RPM HDDs only. HybridDyn is able to reduce the average response time for an enterprise scale random-write dominant workload by about 71%as compared to a HDD-based system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005391/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12215499","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HybridStore: A Cost-Efficient, High-Performance Storage System Combining SSDs and HDDs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HybridStore: A Cost-Efficient, High-Performance Storage System Combining SSDs and HDDs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4430a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112471S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6004863","isNumber":"6005352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6004863","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6005352","articleId":"6005391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005434,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37899197600"},{"name":"Yue Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Hu","id":"37896817300"},{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Department of Experimental Statistics, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37634386400"},{"name":"Lu Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37287417400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4509-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005434","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":841},"abstract":"We present a comprehensive study on the performance and power consumption of a recent ATI GPU.

Based on those results, we derive instructive principles that can guide the design of power-efficient high performance computing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005103/6005426/06005434.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2011.51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2011.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and Power Analysis of ATI GPU: A Statistical Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Power demand","VLIW","Radiation detectors","Computational modeling","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","computer power supplies","coprocessors","performance evaluation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","power analysis","ATI GPU","statistical model","general-purpose GPU","GPGPU","GPU architecture","power consumption","power-efficient high performance computing systems","graphics processing units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","VLIW","OPENCL","model","performance","power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance and Power Analysis of ATI GPU: A Statistical Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005434/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215529","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and Power Analysis of ATI GPU: A Statistical Approach","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4509a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06375S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005103","isNumber":"6005426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005103","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6005426","articleId":"6005434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005437,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Tian","id":"37398768400"},{"name":"Shu Yin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Yin","id":"37400289000"},{"name":"Jiong Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Jiong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37405092500"},{"name":"Ji Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37900937300"},{"name":"Xiao Qin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Aubum University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Qin","id":"37285874000"},{"name":"Mohammed I.

Although heterogeneity issues of distributed systems have been widely investigated, little attention has yet been paid to security solutions designed for distributed storage systems with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. This fact motivates us to investigate a fragment allocation scheme called S-FAS to improve security of a distributed system where storage sites have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. In the S-FAS approach, we integrate file fragmentation with the secret sharing technique in a distributed storage system with heterogeneous vulnerabilities. Storage sites in a distributed systems are classified into a variety of different server types based on vulnerability characteristics. Given a file and a distributed system, S-FAS allocates fragments of the file to as many different types of nodes as possible in the system. Data confidentiality is preserved because fragments of a file are allocated to multiple storage nodes. We develop storage assurance and dynamic assurance models to evaluate the quality of security offered by S-FAS. Analysis results show that fragment allocations made by S-FAS lead to enhanced security because of the consideration of heterogeneous vulnerabilities in distributed storage systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005437/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12215532","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secure Fragment Allocation in a Distributed Storage System with Heterogeneous Vulnerabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Fragment Allocation in a Distributed Storage System with Heterogeneous Vulnerabilities","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4509a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078796S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005103","isNumber":"6005426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005103","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6005426","articleId":"6005437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005456,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengkai Wu","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengkai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37856575900"},{"name":"Junyao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Junyao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37900936500"},{"name":"Chris Giles","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Giles","id":"37902681600"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37858841600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4509-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005456","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classified Power Capping with Distribution Trees in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Power demand","Servers","Cloud computing","Computers","Power measurement","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capping","distribution trees","cloud computing","power management","data centers","dynamic structure","online service","power budgeting","dynamic capabilities","power distribution units","PDU","power management design","service level agreements","SLA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power capping","distribution trees","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Power management is becoming very important in data centers. Cloud computing is also one of the newest promising data center techniques which is appealing to many big companies. As cloud computing is different from current data centers in terms of power management due to a dynamic structure and property for its online service. Power budgeting, in terms of its important role in power management, provides powerful solutions for cloud computing with dynamic capabilities. To be specific, existing methods for data centers are based on power distribution units (PDU) divided by fixed locations on physical levels. However, it is not suitable for cloud with the dynamic property. We propose a power management design based at the logical level which uses a distribution tree with classified power capping by different service or workload types. By setting multiple trees, we can differentiate and analyze the effect of workload types and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in terms of power characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2011.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2011.52","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005103/6005426/06005456.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Classified Power Capping with Distribution Trees in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215548","htmlLink":"/document/6005456/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classified Power Capping with Distribution Trees in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4509a319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11043S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005103","isNumber":"6005426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005103","xplore-issue":"6005426","articleId":"6005456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005465,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Su","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Su","id":"37896198200"},{"name":"Ling Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900122100"},{"name":"Menghao Su","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Menghao","lastName":"Su","id":"37402527600"},{"name":"Su Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Liu","id":"37068051500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4509-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005465","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":955},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005465","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Engines","Software","Acceleration","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","memory architecture","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor-DMA-based memory copy hardware accelerator","operating systems","device drivers","instruction reduction","CPU","data transfer","direct memory access engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DMA","memory copy","processor","accelerator"]}],"abstract":"For many Operating Systems and device drivers, memory copy is the most time-consuming operation which has always been paid special attention.

Services like Google Docs offer easy file access and sharing, but tie storage with internal data formats and specific applications. Meanwhile, services like Drop box offer general-purpose storage. Yet they have not been widely utilized, partly due to their fee-charging nature and long-term service availability concerns. Web-based email services, on the other hand, have been offering growing email storage capacity, reliable service, and powerful search capability, making them appealing as storage resources. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of leveraging web-based email services to build a personal storage cloud. We present EMFS, which aggregates back-end storage by establishing a RAID-like system on top of virtual email disks formed by email accounts. In particular, by replicating data across accounts from different service providers, highly available storage services can be constructed based on already reliable, cloud-based email storage. This paper discusses the design and implementation of EMFS, focusing on unique challenges and opportunities associated with utilizing email services for file transfer and storage, such as email based data organization, metadata format and management, and handling provider-imposed anti-spam usage restrictions. We evaluated EMFS extensively with multiple benchmarks, and compared its performance with NFS, AFS, and a non-free cloud storage service built upon Amazon S3. Our results indicate that while EMFS cannot match the performance of highly optimized distributed file systems with dedicated servers, it performs quite closely to the commercial cloud storage solution.","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2011.55","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005103/6005426/06005469.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2011.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005426","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMFS: Email-based Personal Cloud Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EMFS: Email-based Personal Cloud Storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005469/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12215558","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005469/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMFS: Email-based Personal Cloud Storage","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4509a248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053354S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005103","isNumber":"6005426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005103","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6005426","articleId":"6005469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6005538,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["National ICT Australia, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37900861700"},{"name":"Hongdong Li","affiliation":["Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Hongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37281097800"},{"name":"Xuming He","affiliation":["NICTA, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Xuming","lastName":"He","id":"37900363800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4541-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005538","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","PSNR","Inference algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Merging","Image denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","image denoising","inference mechanisms","Markov processes","maximum likelihood estimation","median filters","tree data structures","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","MRF approximation","uniform sampled multispanning tree","image processing","Markov random field","multiple-tree structure","re-weighted random walk","maximum a posterior inference","MAP inference","dynamic programming","median filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRF","image denoising","spanning tree","MAP inference"]}],"abstract":"Traditionally, image processing based on Markov Random Field (MRF) is often addressed on a 4-connected grid graph defined on the image.

The experimental results over five pairs of registered multi-focus images and one pair of mis-registered multi-focus images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005547/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12215628","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-focus Image Fusion by Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-focus Image Fusion by Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"4541a017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049388S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005106","isNumber":"6005527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005106","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6005527","articleId":"6005547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6005583,"authors":[{"name":"Di Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Sun","id":"37896754600"},{"name":"Li Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37892900500"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Software, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405817900"},{"name":"Jiawan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Software, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jiawan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281468400"},{"name":"Gang Pan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37900316700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4541-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005583","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image resolution","TV","Coherence","Multiresolution analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","image resolution","image texture","Markov processes","random processes","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structure-aware image completion","texture propagation","belief propagation","energy minimization","discrete Markov random field","wavelet multiresolution image pyramid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image completion","image inpainting","Markov","multiresolution"]}],"abstract":"Structure-aware image completion has the reputation of keeping the salient structure of images, except for the case in texture propagation of images with distinguishing texture characteristics and large missing region.

However, for the sake of cubic time complexity, spectral clustering is hardly used for clustering large-scale data sets. Therefore, sampling-based methods such as Nystrom method and Column sampling are respectively conducted as potential approaches to tackle this challenge. As we know, current sampling-based methods often utilize the uniform or other random sampling policies to select representative data and tend to disregard the data in small size clusters. This paper proposes an unbiased sampling framework, derives a new sampling method called inverse-degree sampling and then introduces an entropy criterion to prove it in theory simply. According to the selection of representative data by inverse-degree sampling in spectral clustering, the time complexity of spectral clustering becomes quadratic. Experiments on both toy data and real-world data demonstrate both the good sampling performance and the comparable clustering quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005587/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12215665","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Inverse-degree Sampling for Spectral Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse-degree Sampling for Spectral Clustering","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"4541a362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064633S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005106","isNumber":"6005527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005106","xplore-issue":"6005527","articleId":"6005587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005593,"authors":[{"name":"Shaomin Zhang","firstName":"Shaomin","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Lijia Zhi","firstName":"Lijia","lastName":"Zhi"},{"name":"Dazhe Zhao","firstName":"Dazhe","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Hong Zhao","firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4541-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005593","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Image registration","Biomedical imaging","Entropy","Robustness","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","feature extraction","image fusion","image registration","medical image processing","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum spanning tree","hierarchically multifeature points fusion","high-dimensional feature fusion","medical image registration","feature extraction","corner-like point extraction","edge-like point extraction","BrainWeb","normalized mutual information based registration method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["minimal spanning tree","corner-like points","dge-like points","hierarchical registration mechanism"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel medical registration approach based on minimal spanning tree.

The parallel nature of CNNs makes them suitable to be implemented on a reconfigurable device, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). An FPGA implementation of CNNs achieves high performance and flexibility due to fine-grain parallelism of the FPGA-based implementations.

The goal of spectrum sensing is to identify holes. Malicious nodes are degraded the performance of spectrum sensing. To mitigate spectrum sensing data falsification attack, we employ support vector data description in sensing procedure. The SVDD algorithm distinguishes malicious nodes from trusted ones and omits them from decision phase. In other words, the proposed algorithm omits outliers from decision phase. It tries to construct the boundary around the target data by enclosing the target data within a minimum hyper-sphere. Inspired by the support vector machine the SVDD decision boundary is described by a few target objects, known as support vectors. Then the algorithm votes between trusted nodes to decide whether the spectrum is empty. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by computer simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005686/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12221708","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005686/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detection of SSDF Attack Using SVDD Algorithm in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of SSDF Attack Using SVDD Algorithm in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4482a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058813S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005193","isNumber":"6005649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005193","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6005649","articleId":"6005686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6005697,"authors":[{"name":"Pengbo Si","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, P.R.

However, for the highly intelligent wireless devices in the future, the assumption \"CR devices introduce no interference to the primary users (PUs)\" in traditional CR systems may do not exist anymore, due to that the devices are always trying to maximize their own reward, without considering the interference to the others. In this paper, the concept of proactively-optimization CR network is introduced to deal with this problem by enforcing ``punishment'' or ``penalty'' to illegal CR transmissions. Under the framework of proactively-optimization CR networks, with the reward function defined in this paper, the spectrum resource allocation decision making problem of primary users is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and an optimal resource allocation scheme with the objective of maximizing the PU's reward is proposed. Furthermore, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the reward significantly compared to the existing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005697/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12228494","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005697/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Policy of Primary Users in Proactively-Optimization Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation Policy of Primary Users in Proactively-Optimization Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4482a343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042579S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005193","isNumber":"6005649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005193","xplore-issue":"6005649","articleId":"6005697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6005701,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Jing Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Jing-Jing","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37537191700"},{"name":"Chi-Man Pun","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Man","lastName":"Pun","id":"37279690400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4482-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005701","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005701","abstract":"This paper presents a patchwork method for digital watermarking based on Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN).

In this paper an enhanced alternative benchmarking technique is proposed that is based on the actual workload execution times for each heterogeneous processing node. Using the same pattern-classification problem on the same heterogeneous platform setup used in the previous technique, results show that the proposed technique has attained higher speedup in comparison with the former.","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2011.65","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005193/6005649/06005706.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"280","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2011.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Parallel & Distributed Implementation of the Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Parallel & Distributed Implementation of the Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12228497","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005706/","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Parallel & Distributed Implementation of the Harmony Search Based Supervised Training of Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4482a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079625S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005193","isNumber":"6005649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005193","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6005649","articleId":"6005706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005710,"authors":[{"name":"Gursharanjeet Singh Kalra","affiliation":["Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Gursharanjeet Singh","lastName":"Kalra","id":"37888714100"},{"name":"Rajneesh Talwar","affiliation":["RIMT Institute of Engineering & Technology, Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Rajneesh","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37889765100"},{"name":"Harsh Sadawarti","affiliation":["RIMT Institute of Engineering & Technology, Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Harsh","lastName":"Sadawarti","id":"37847122300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4482-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005710","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005710","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","PSNR","Robustness","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","discrete wavelet transforms","image watermarking","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust blind digital image watermarking","DWT","dual encryption technique","computer piracy","Internet","image piracy","image duplicity","random sequence","Arnold transformation","Chaos transformation","discrete wavelet transformation","third level decomposition","frequency domain","binary watermark","HL3 domain","signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Watermarking","Image","DWT","Frequency domain Robust","Blind"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2011.56","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005193/6005649/06005710.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","startPage":"225","endPage":"230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2011.56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Blind Digital Image Watermarking Using DWT and Dual Encryption Technique","abstract":"Piracy in the presence of internet and computers proves to be a biggest jolt to the concerned industry. To reduce the piracy and duplicity of the images, digital watermarking technique is having an edge over the other available techniques. In this paper, a blind digital watermarking algorithm is presented which is robust enough to resist the watermark against the attacks. The algorithm exploits the random sequence generated by Arnold and Chaos transformations. Discrete wavelet transformation of third level decomposition is used to convert the image into its frequency domain. The binary watermark is embedded into its HL3 domain. The evaluation of the algorithm is calculated in terms of peak signal to noise ratio and non correlation.

TMAC extends CSMA/CA by scheduling data packets based on their age. Prior to transmitting a data packet, a transmitter broadcasts a request control message appended with a timestamp to a selected list of neighbors. It can proceed with the transmission only if it receives a sufficient number of grant control messages from these neighbors. A grant message indicates that the associated data packet has the lowest timestamp of all the packets pending transmission at the local transmit queue. We demonstrate that a loose ordering of timestamps among neighboring nodes is sufficient for enforcing local fairness, subsequently leading to flow rate fairness in a multi-hop WMN. We show that TMAC can be implemented using the control frames in IEEE 802.11 stack, and thus can be easily integrated in existing 802.11-based WMNs. Our simulation results show that TMAC achieves excellent resource allocation fairness while maintaining over 90% of maximum link capacity in parking lot and large grid topologies.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005807","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005807.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TMAC: Timestamp-Ordered MAC for CSMA/CA Wireless Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"TMAC: Timestamp-Ordered MAC for CSMA/CA Wireless Mesh Networks","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005807/","accessionNumber":"12221163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005807/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TMAC: Timestamp-Ordered MAC for CSMA/CA Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1088952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068974S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6005818,"authors":[{"name":"Deli Jia","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Deli","lastName":"Jia","id":"37070239700"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"},{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"38516728900"},{"name":"Xiaolong Zhu","affiliation":["Huawei Shanghai Research Institute, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38557598300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6005818","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Resource management","Radio spectrum management","Throughput","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic soft-frequency reuse","inter-cell coordination","OFDMA networks","downlink dynamic soft frequency reuse scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA cellular networks","clustered base station coordination strategy","frequency resource allocation","wireless channels","multiuser diversity","computer simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a downlink dynamic soft frequency reuse (SFR) scheme with inter-cell coordination in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular networks.

LARX uses network traffic data archived at a vantage point and analyzes these data for phishing attacks.

In this paper, the merits of multi-feature joint representation based for face recognition is studied. The whole approach of face recognition can be separated into two phases: training phase and recognition phase. At first, given a query image, we train the recognition system by using the gabor and gradient features together to represent the face images. In the second phase, modular LRC classification will be used to classify the face images rather than an NN classification. Unlike the traditional LRC algorithm which operates directly on the whole face image patterns, the modular method operates on sub-blocks partitioned from an original whole face image. Experiments are carried on two face databases, the results show that the combination of the gabor information and the gradient information by modular LRC are better than the method using the single information.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Image and Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005106/6005527/06005866.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"592","publicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Image and Graphics","doi":"10.1109/ICIG.2011.111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIG.2011.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition with Multi-feature Joint Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Databases","Training","Gabor filters","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","gradient methods","image classification","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","multifeature joint representation","training phase","recognition phase","query image","Gabor feature","gradient feature","modular LRC classification","face image classification","LRC algorithm","face database","Gabor information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition with Multi-feature Joint Representation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12215747","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition with Multi-feature Joint Representation","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"4541a587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046184S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005106","isNumber":"6005527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005106","xplore-issue":"6005527","articleId":"6005866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6005873,"authors":[{"name":"Chafik Maghzaoui","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche Mod\u00e9lisation, Analyse et Commande des Syst\u00e8mes MACS, Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Gab\u00e8s, University of Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Chafik","lastName":"Maghzaoui","id":"37402000100"},{"name":"Houssem Jerbi","affiliation":["Laboratoire dEtude et de Commande Automatique des Processus LECAP, Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Houssem","lastName":"Jerbi","id":"37304090600"},{"name":"Mohamed Naceur Abdelkrim","affiliation":["Unit\u00e9 de Recherche Mod\u00e9lisation, Analyse et Commande des Syst\u00e8mes MACS, Ecole Nationale dIng\u00e9nieurs de Gab\u00e8s, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed Naceur","lastName":"Abdelkrim","id":"37269456500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4482-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005873","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Mathematical model","Induction machines","Stators","Time varying systems","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","induction motors","linearisation techniques","Lyapunov methods","machine control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","poles and zeros","position control","stability","state feedback","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO time varying system control","MIMO nonlinear systems control","linear time varying form","stable dynamic inversion methodology","poles placement state feedback control","induction machine","trajectory linearization control","Lyapunov coordinate transformation","control input design","nominal trajectory","stable inversion design","speed trajectory tracking","asynchronous motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-Varying Systems","Dynamic Inversion","Trajectory Linearization","Induction Machine"]}],"abstract":"In This paper, we study a MIMO nonlinear systems control via the linear time-varying form and stable dynamic inversion methodology. We apply a poles placement state feedback control of MIMO nonlinear systems of an induction machine using trajectory linearization control. The nonlinear system is linearized along a nominal trajectory to yield a MIMO linear time-varying one which is transformed into the controller canonical form through a Lyapunov coordinate transformation, which serves to compute the control input design. The nominal trajectory is not easy to calculate because systems are governed by many physical constraints and the requested movement that the system needs to do must be, first of all, feasible. So a stable inversion design has been used to generate the nominal trajectory from the desired output. The effectiveness of the developed approach is checked on a real speed trajectory tracking of an asynchronous motor.","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2011.41","publicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005193/6005649/06005873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2011.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005649","startPage":"146","endPage":"151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO Time-Varying System Control Via a Stable Dynamic Inversion Methodology: Case of an Induction Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MIMO Time-Varying System Control Via a Stable Dynamic Inversion Methodology: Case of an Induction Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221741","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MIMO Time-Varying System Control Via a Stable Dynamic Inversion Methodology: Case of an Induction Machine","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"4482a146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049081S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005193","isNumber":"6005649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005193","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6005649","articleId":"6005873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005874,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hwa Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hwa","lastName":"Kim","id":"37900608300"},{"name":"Su-Yeon Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Su-Yeon","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37896482400"},{"name":"Bok-Jin Oh","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bok-Jin","lastName":"Oh","id":"37893862500"},{"name":"Doo-Hyun Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Doo-Hyun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292245600"},{"name":"Jinhee Lee","affiliation":["Smart Grid Research Team, Research Institute of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinhee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37559310900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0975-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4482-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005874","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Poles and towers","Atmospheric modeling","Chemicals","Turbines","Production","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","chemical engineering","chemical industry","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","poles and towers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network based modeling method","chemical plant rectifying tower","chemical plant modeling","chemical processes","multilayer perceptron","backpropagation learning algorithm","oxygen production"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rectifying tower","chemical plant","artificial neural network","modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005874","abstract":"An artificial neural network based modeling method of a chemical plant's rectifying towers is presented in this paper.

However, the performance of energy-aware SS is greatly compromised by the accompanying inter-channel interference (ICI). Aiming to alleviate ICI, this paper proposes an energy-aware cooperative SS method with ICI cancellation. The proposed method consists of two parts: the determination of the optimal threshold and the ICI cancellation. The optimal threshold is obtained by minimizing the sum of probabilities of false alarm and missed detection. The ICI cancellation is implemented indirectly by solving a non-homogeneous linear equation set with a coefficient matrix depending only on the distances between the secondary users and the transmitters of primary users. Simulation shows that the proposed SS method can efficiently cope with the ICI and can achieve much better performance in the range with low signal to interference-plus-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005879","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005879.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005879","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Inter-Channel Interference Cancellation for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Inter-Channel Interference Cancellation for Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005879/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005879/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221183","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Inter-Channel Interference Cancellation for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1088014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054688S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005880,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume de la Roche","affiliation":["Centre of Wireless Network Design, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"de la Roche","id":"37302869000"},{"name":"Jean-Frederic Wagen","affiliation":["Mobile Systems Group, UAS-WS Fribourg, EIA-FR, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Frederic","lastName":"Wagen","id":"37344265400"},{"name":"Guillaume Villemaud","affiliation":["CITI Laboratory/INRIA, ARES project, INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Villemaud","id":"37294186600"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Gorce","affiliation":["CITI Laboratory/INRIA, ARES project, INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Gorce","id":"37264985500"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6005880","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Planning","Finite difference methods","Antennas and propagation","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","frequency-domain analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ParFlow","femtocell networks","heterogeneous network","macrocell layer","deterministic model","time domain","frequency domain"]}],"abstract":"In the context of heterogeneous networks, femtocells are very promising.

In this work, we consider a cross layer optimal design of routing, medium access control (MAC) scheduling, and physical layer resource allocation for WMNs, where nodes are equipped with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas. MIMO antennas can greatly improves the throughput by transmitting multiple independent data streams and/or suppressing the interference from neighboring links. To address the MAC and stream control at the physical layer, we consider the notion of Transmission Configurations (TCs). By incorporating the TCs in the cross-layer design, we formulate a Joint Routing and Stream Control Scheduling (JRSCS) problem as a linear program (LP), with the objective of finding a minimum length schedule that satisfies the traffic demand of a set of end-to-end sessions. A column generation based method is proposed to solve the JRSCS problem. The simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the scheme. We have also evaluated the impact of the physical layer capabilities such as number of antennas, single and multi-user radios on the scheduling time of the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005895.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Routing and Stream Control Scheduling in MIMO-Based WMNs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Routing","Physical layer","Receivers","Joints","Interference","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication control","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-based WMN","wireless mesh networks","cross layer optimal design","medium access control scheduling","physical layer resource allocation","MIMO antennas","transmission configurations","joint routing and stream control scheduling","linear program"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Routing and Stream Control Scheduling in MIMO-Based WMNs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005895/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221196","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Routing and Stream Control Scheduling in MIMO-Based WMNs","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051222S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6005898,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Shepard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Shepard","id":"37741051100"},{"name":"Douglas Schmidt","affiliation":["CenturyLink, Monroe, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Douglas","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37894876800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6005898","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Markov processes","Mathematical model","Steady-state","Equations","Bit error rate","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","diversity reception","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","Markov processes","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","random processes","spread spectrum communication","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reacquisition-induced outage prediction","DSSS","OFDMA","multipath fading channels","MIMO antennae","space diversity","adaptive equalizers","channel model","fading dynamics","random processes","probability distributions","Markov model","steady-state predictions","wireless communication"]}],"abstract":"Reacquisition-induced outages continue to increase in importance for advanced systems that employ MIMO antennae, space diversity and adaptive equalizers to mitigate the effects of multipath fading.

The utility of these are illustrated via the simulation of a variety of wireless communication scenarios, which also demonstrate conditions under which reacquisition is the dominant source of outages.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005898","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005898.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traditional and Reacquisition-Induced Outage Prediction for DSSS and OFDMA Systems on Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Traditional and Reacquisition-Induced Outage Prediction for DSSS and OFDMA Systems on Multipath Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005898/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221199","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6005898/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traditional and Reacquisition-Induced Outage Prediction for DSSS and OFDMA Systems on Multipath Fading Channels","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060398S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005911,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryota","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37888745200"},{"name":"Hideki Ochiai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37269532900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6005911","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"Trellis shaping (TS) is known as one of flexible methods to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signals. However, the complexity of the conventional TS based on the Viterbi algorithm (VA) increases substantially as one increases the number of trellis states for improved PAPR reduction performance. In this paper, we consider the application of M-algorithm to the TS for possible computational reduction. It is observed that the use of M-algorithm results in effective reduction of computation compared to the VA with comparable peak power reduction performance. The two contrastive metrics in time and frequency domain proposed in the literature are also investigated for comparison.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005911.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Signals Using Trellis Shaping with M-Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Peak to average power ratio","Complexity theory","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","trellis coded modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signals","Trellis shaping","M-algorithm","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","Viterbi algorithm","PAPR reduction","computational reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Signals Using Trellis Shaping with M-Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221211","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak Power Reduction of OFDM Signals Using Trellis Shaping with M-Algorithm","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1092058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038029S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005915,"authors":[{"name":"Hsieh-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsieh-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37900586500"},{"name":"H.

A lot of research has been found to mitigate the ICI effect in order to improve the system performance. However, ICI reduction algorithms usually require the information of the channel impulse response (CIR) sample by sample. In this paper, we propose a new decision feedback ICI cancellation (DFIC) algorithm with modified decision feedback CIR estimation. The proposed DFIC algorithm uses the time-domain Kalman filter for initial CIR estimation for the coefficients of the DFIC equalizer. Then, the iterative decision feedback loop can be used to enhance the estimation of CIR values such that more accurate coefficients can be obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed ICI mitigation algorithm incorporating decision feedback channel estimation is effective to deal with the ICI in mobile OFDM channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005918","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Method for Mobile OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005918/","displayDocTitle":"Modified Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Method for Mobile OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221218","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005918/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Decision Feedback Channel Estimation Method for Mobile OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1092428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074151S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005934,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279156600"},{"name":"Ying Dai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Dai","id":"37856708200"},{"name":"Yanchao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA","State Key Laboratory of Novel Software, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Yanchao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37535969200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6005934","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Copper","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Topology","Simulation","Bipartite graph"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local channel assignments","cognitive radio networks","communication networks","protocol localization","node connectivity maximization","packet delivery","edge priority"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005934","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06005934.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Channel Assignments in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) promise to enable the next generation of communication networks.

The MIMO channel is modeled via its virtual representation, where the individual spatial paths between the antenna pairs are Gilbert-Elliot channels. The whole system is then described by a K-State Markov chain, where K depends upon the degree of freedom (DOF) of the channel. We prove that the DOF based modeling is indeed accurate.

In particular, the transmit powers of base stations and handsets must be carefully adjusted to help reduce interference between users and also improve cell capacity. Indeed, large gains can be achieved by taking into account primary user's behaviors and allowing secondary users to utilize the unused spectrum of idling primary users. Along these lines, this study presents a novel game-theoretic solution in which primary users are rewarded for sharing their spectrum with secondary users to help achieve energy-efficient transmission. Overall, this effort extends upon our earlier work on fast-flat fading channels by further analyzing Rician slow-flat- fading channels. In particular, the presentation derives a closed-form expression for the average utility function and also shows the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Detailed simulation results are then presented to verify performance of the game-theoretic formulation under realistic slow-flat fading channels, and the findings compared against those with the simpler additive white Gaussian noise channel model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12221243","htmlLink":"/document/6005943/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretic Power Control under Rician Slow-Flat Fading Channels in Cognitive Radios Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretic Power Control under Rician Slow-Flat Fading Channels in Cognitive Radios Networks","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060754S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6005943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6005971,"authors":[{"name":"Erke Shang","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Erke","lastName":"Shang","id":"37901247600"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37676295400"},{"name":"Xiangjing An","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjing","lastName":"An","id":"37565563900"},{"name":"Hangen He","affiliation":["College of Mechatronics and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hangen","lastName":"He","id":"37291666400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4541-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005971","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Roads","Convolution","Real time systems","Detectors","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","driver information systems","edge detection","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steerable filter","FPGA","vision-based lane detection","driver-assistance system","road scenes","local edge detector","vanishing point position","field programmable gate array device","digital image processing","edge extraction algorithm","vanishing point estimation","multiengine technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Line Detection","Steerable Filter","Vanish Point","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Vision-based lane detection is a key component for Driver-Assistance (DA) systems. It is still a challenging task in road scenes with complex shadows. This paper presents a novel local edge detector, using vanishing point position as a high level information to guide the use of steerable filters in lane detection, and its implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. The FPGA technology has the advantages of high-performances for digital image processing and low cost, both of which are the requirements of DA systems. The main contributions of this work are twofold: 1) an edge extraction algorithm for lane detection is proposed, using the estimated vanishing point as high-level information to detect lanes. Firstly, a rough estimation of the vanishing point is used for calculating the expected local edge orientations. Secondly, a steerable filter is tuned to the expected direction for edge response. 2) a framework on FPGA is designed to implement the proposed algorithm. The framework is designed by using multi-engine technology, so it works in parallel for any order of steerable filters. Experiments and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in dealing with the complex shadow conditions, and works in real-time on FPGA device.","doi":"10.1109/ICIG.2011.127","publicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Image and Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Sixth International Conference on Image and Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005106/6005527/06005971.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIG.2011.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6005971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lane Detection Using Steerable Filters and FPGA-based Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6005971/","displayDocTitle":"Lane Detection Using Steerable Filters and FPGA-based Implementation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6005971/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12215775","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lane Detection Using Steerable Filters and FPGA-based Implementation","confLoc":"Hefei, China","sourcePdf":"4541a908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06053S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005106","isNumber":"6005527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005106","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6005527","articleId":"6005971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6005976,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ce","lastName":"Li","id":"37897392400"},{"name":"Zhenjun Han","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenjun","lastName":"Han","id":"37897747400"},{"name":"Qixiang Ye","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qixiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37416976100"},{"name":"Jianbin Jiao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianbin","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37546470800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1560-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4541-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6005976","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":593},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for abnormal behavior detection in surveillance videos via sparse reconstruction analysis.

The paper consists of two analyses which are the interference impact by the femtocell and the macrocell at a user equipment and the load impact to the control plane in evolved packet core network by X2 and S1 handover signaling messages. On the results of investigations by performance simulations with regard to the receiving power and signal-to-noise ratio at a user equipment side, the unavailable zone to the inbound handover from macrocell to femtocell occurred due to a severe intercell interference depending on a femtocell topology. Therefore, we found that an intercell interference coordination between macrocell and femtocell in order to make an inbound handover is needed and that X2 interface is the better solution rather than S1 interface for an inbound handover by investigating the X2 and S1 handover procedure of 3GPP. Ultimately, it is shown that the X2 interface between macrocell and femtocell can play an important role in an high reliable inbound handover and a simple interference control implementation on femtocell environment.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006005","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006005.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inbound Mobility Management on LTE-Advanced Femtocell Topology Using X2 Interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006005/","displayDocTitle":"Inbound Mobility Management on LTE-Advanced Femtocell Topology Using X2 Interface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221249","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006005/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inbound Mobility Management on LTE-Advanced Femtocell Topology Using X2 Interface","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1088438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076487S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6006020,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce DeBruhl","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"DeBruhl","id":"37891582800"},{"name":"Patrick Tague","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Tague","id":"37547773500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6006020","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","IEEE 802.15 Standards","Receivers","Protocols","Error analysis","Software","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","jamming","protocols","software radio","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filter design","jamming mitigation","802.15.4 communication protocol","wireless sensor networking applications","narrow spectral component"]}],"abstract":"Jamming attackers can dramatically increase attack efficiency and stealth by randomly or periodically cycling the jamming transmission on and off, attacks respectively known as random and periodic jamming.

In the graph model, the interference experienced by an edge in a WSN has been defined in at least two different ways: the sender-based and receiver-based interference models. These models have been extensively studied in the literature although the receiver-based model has received more attention. Recently, several researchers have started investigating interference in the more realistic physical model which is known as the Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model. The SINR model better reflects the real environment than the receiver-based or sender-based graph models. In this paper, we study the problem of assigning power to nodes in the plane to yield a connected network of minimum edge interference in the receiver-based (RB-MEI) as well as the SINR models (SINR-MEI). We show that RB-MEI is NP- complete for geometric graphs. For SINR-MEI, NP- completeness holds for planar geometric graphs. We also propose some simple greedy heuristics based on the minimum spanning tree approach, and study their performance through simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006021.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Complexity of Minimizing Receiver-Based and SINR Edge Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Load modeling","Data models","Ad hoc networks","Switches","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","graph theory","greedy algorithms","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","trees (mathematics)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver-based minimization complexity","SINR edge interference","topology control","power consumption reduction","wireless ad hoc network","wireless sensor network","WSN","sender-based interference model","receiver-based interference model","signal-to-interference- noise-ratio model","sender-based graph model","receiver-based graph model","RB-MEI","SINR-MEI","NP-completeness","planar geometric graph","greedy heuristics","minimum spanning tree approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Complexity of Minimizing Receiver-Based and SINR Edge Interference","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006021/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221262","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Complexity of Minimizing Receiver-Based and SINR Edge Interference","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1089826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094323S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6006025,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Coelho","affiliation":["UNINOVA, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Coelho","id":"37594182100"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Departamento de Engenharia Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal","Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["UNINOVA, Caparica, Portugal","Departamento de Engenharia Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6006025","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","OFDM","Neodymium","Receivers","Frequency domain analysis","Feedback loop"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization","iterative receivers","joint detection","outperforming SC-FDE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and SC-FDE (Single-Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization) schemes where the channel is estimated with the help of training blocks multiplexed with data blocks.

Our receivers allow significant performance improvements, for both OFDM and SC-FDE, with OFDM slightly outperforming SC-FDE.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006025","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Channel Estimation for OFDM and SC-FDE Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006025/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel Estimation for OFDM and SC-FDE Schemes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221264","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006025/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel Estimation for OFDM and SC-FDE Schemes","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1090134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058517S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6006033,"authors":[{"name":"Sohraab Soltani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas, Tyler, Tyler, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sohraab","lastName":"Soltani","id":"37684320500"},{"name":"Kiran Misra","affiliation":["Advance Video Display Technology, Sharp Laboratories of America, Inc.orporated, Camas, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Misra","id":"37300244200"},{"name":"Hayder Radha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Hayder","lastName":"Radha","id":"37269513400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6006033","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006033","abstract":"In this paper, we develop Prioritized Adaptive Code-Enhanced (PACE) link-layer protocol to achieve preferred data recovery order across connections, while maintaining stable and reliable data flow over a wireless network.

In such large-scale and complex systems, failures are common. Proactive failure management is a crucial technology to characterize system behaviors and forecast failure dynamics in the cloud. To make failure predictions, we need to monitor the system execution and collect health-related runtime performance data. However, in newly deployed or managed cloud systems, these data are usually unlabeled. Supervised learning based approaches are not suitable in this case. In this paper, we present an unsupervised failure detection method using an ensemble of Bayesian models. It estimates the probability distribution of runtime performance data collected by health monitoring tools when cloud servers perform normally. It characterizes normal execution states of the system and detects anomalous behaviors.

However current design practices still involve building independent networks that each make their own resource decisions. In spite of the tremendous amount of related research in this area, there are still several elemental questions that must be addressed. First, is it better to treat wireless systems as independent access networks requiring the user to handle aspects of roaming between disparate wireless networks or is an internet model better where independent autonomous wireless systems (AWS) cooperate to form a single, unified cloud to users, with network level resource allocation? Second, is it better to have dedicated, low power circuitry that supports a limited set of independent wireless Radio Access technologies (RATs) or is it better to build agile handsets that adapt (reconfigure) in real-time to operate over a large range of RAT technologies and operating modes? The results in this paper shed light on these questions. We present preliminary results from a MATLAB-based simulation study that highlights the increase in spectral efficiency as the modality of devices increase. Our analysis takes into account the cost of radio reconfiguration in terms of the temporary communications downtime and the surge of power that occurs with each reconfiguration operation. Our main result suggests that nomadic users benefit the most primarily due to their ability to route traffic over 'hotspot' type of RATs that tend to have high data rates at reduced coverage, and that this in turn helps increase the 3G or 4G bandwidth available to mobile users. All nodes in the system experience an increase in spectral efficiency ranging from 14% to 75% when compared to a similar scenario that assumes no network cooperation and static radios.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006046.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Reconfigurable Devices to Maximize Spectral Efficiency in Future Heterogeneous Wireless Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile communication","Field programmable gate arrays","Resource management","Wireless networks","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","mobile communication","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable device","spectral efficiency","heterogeneous wireless system","broadband data","cellular voice","mobile device","Internet model","autonomous wireless system","AWS","radio access technology","RAT","radio reconfiguration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using Reconfigurable Devices to Maximize Spectral Efficiency in Future Heterogeneous Wireless Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006046/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006046/","accessionNumber":"12221284","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Reconfigurable Devices to Maximize Spectral Efficiency in Future Heterogeneous Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061967S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6006062,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37276885400"},{"name":"Canming Jiang","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Canming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37709950100"},{"name":"Y.

This effort is critical to the fundamental understanding of the scalability of such network. However, due to the heterogeneity in available frequency bands at each node, the asymptotic capacity is much more difficult to develop than prior efforts for other types of wireless networks. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce two auxiliary networks \u03b6 and \u03b1 to analyze the capacity upper bound and lower bound.

In addition, if femtocells are operated on OFDMA systems, each subchannel can be reused separately among femtocells by carefully treating inter-cell interferences. However, due to a large number of femtocells and their uncoordinated and irregular deployment, we need to treat intercell interferences very carefully in OFDMA-based fmetocell networks, which make developing efficient resource allocation schemes more difficult. In this paper, we study a subchannel allocation problem that aims at maximizing the sum utility of the OFDMA-based femtocell network. Since the problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming, which is inherently difficult to solve, we propose a suboptimal subchannel allocation algorithm. The proposed subchannel allocation algorithm consists of two steps: calculating the number of subchannels that should be granted to each femtocell to maximize the sum utility and finding actual subchannel allocation that achieves the granted number of subchannels for each femtocell. Numerical results show that the proposed subchannel allocation algorithm provides near-optimal performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-Based Subchannel Allocation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006068","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006068.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","displayDocTitle":"Utility-Based Subchannel Allocation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006068/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-Based Subchannel Allocation for OFDMA Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043896S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6006071,"authors":[{"name":"Shinji Ogawa","affiliation":["Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37896336400"},{"name":"Fumie Ono","affiliation":["Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumie","lastName":"Ono","id":"37269248700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6006071","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Antennas","Nickel","MIMO","Relays","Decoding","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","communication complexity","decoding","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","MIMO communication","network coding","numerical analysis","orthogonal codes","radio links","signal detection","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual polarization antennas","diversity gain","decoding complexity","multihop network","space time block coded MIMO network coding","horizontal polarized antenna","vertical polarized antenna","STBC signal transmission","forward links","backward links","polarized orthogonal STBC-MIMO network coding"]}],"abstract":"To achieve the full data rate and diversity gain with low decoding complexity in a multi-hop network, a space time block coded MIMO network coding (STBC-MIMO) with dual polarization antennas is proposed.

As results, STBC-MIMO network coding can supply about 2.0 times higher performance than the conventional STBC-MIMO network coding by using dual polarization antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006071","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006071.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STBC-MIMO Network Coding with Dual Polarization Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006071/","displayDocTitle":"STBC-MIMO Network Coding with Dual Polarization Antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221304","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006071/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STBC-MIMO Network Coding with Dual Polarization Antennas","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1091912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070543S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6006077,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Kumar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37392452000"},{"name":"Jing Feng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Feng","id":"37532915500"},{"name":"Yamini Nimmagadda","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yamini","lastName":"Nimmagadda","id":"37545660100"},{"name":"Yung-Hsiang Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Yung-Hsiang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280555000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0638-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0637-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0636-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"6006077","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":997},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Real-Time Tasks Using Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006077","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Real time systems","Equations","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Optimization","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","optimisation","processor scheduling","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","real-time tasks","cloud computing","infrastructure as a service model","elasticity","constrained optimization problem","polynomial-time solution","earliest deadline first method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006077","abstract":"This paper presents a method to allocate resources for real-time tasks using the \"Infrastructure as a Service\" model offered by cloud computing. Real-time tasks have to be completed before deadlines, and cloud computing offers selection of resources with different speeds and costs. In cloud computing, resource allocations can be scaled up based on the requirements; this is called elasticity and is the key difference from existing multiprocessor task allocation. Scalable resources make economical allocation of resources an important problem. We analyze the problem of allocating resources for a set of realtime tasks such that the economic cost is minimized and all the deadlines are met. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem and propose a polynomial-time solution to allocate resources efficiently. We compare the economic costs and performance provided by our solution with the optimal solution and an EDF (earliest deadline first) method. We show how the cost varies based on the distribution of the tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221308","htmlLink":"/document/6006077/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Real-Time Tasks Using Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Real-Time Tasks Using Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1092006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089325S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6006078,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Additionally, along with the above bounding techniques, we have adopted an accurate approximate MGF of end-to-end SNR of CAF relay system to compute above mentioned performance metrics. Employing the above novel approach based on \"approximate MGF\" allows us to simplify the computation complexity of achievable spectral efficiency as well as ABER of CAF relay system in generalized fading environments by simply replacing appropriate single channel MGF as readily available.

However, providing support for e.g. flow-based routing where flows of one source take different paths through the network is hard to implement in a unified way using traditional routing protocols. OpenFlow is an emerging technology which makes network elements such as routers or switches programmable via a standardized interface. By using virtualization and flow-based routing, OpenFlow enables a rapid deployment of novel packet forwarding and routing algorithms, focusing on fixed networks. We propose an architecture that integrates OpenFlow with WMNs and provides such flow-based routing and forwarding capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of our OpenFlow based approach, we have implemented a simple solution to solve the problem of client mobility in a WMN which handles the fast migration of client addresses (e.g. IP addresses) between Mesh Access Points and the interaction with re-routing without the need for tunneling. Measurements from a real mesh testbed (KAUMesh) demonstrate the feasibility of our approach based on the evaluation of forwarding performance, control traffic and rule activation time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6005707","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005186/6005707/06006100.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenFlow for Wireless Mesh Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006100/","displayDocTitle":"OpenFlow for Wireless Mesh Networks","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221321","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenFlow for Wireless Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Lahaina, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"pid1092252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046074S","chronDate":"July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005186","isNumber":"6005707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005186","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6005707","articleId":"6006100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6006110,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Lei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Lei","id":"37896759100"},{"name":"Hua Lei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Xi''an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Lei","id":"37896157800"},{"name":"Qiu Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Xi''an Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiu","lastName":"Han","id":"37895063300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7255-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7253-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7254-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6006110","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Convex functions","Antennas","Channel capacity","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","convex programming","MIMO communication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant-power waterfilling","MIMO channels","MIMO systems","channel state information","transmit antennas","channel capacity","non-optimal power allocation","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO systems, when channel state information is available at the transmitter, power could be allocated adaptively among multiple transmit antennas to achieve large channel capacity.

Current authentication mechanisms for cognitive radio networks are based on PPP Extensible Authentication Protocols. Future cognitive radio network can fusion current wireless standards. However, security requirements of various wireless standards are different which leads to current authentication mechanisms are not suitable for cognitive radio networks. Therefore, an identity authentication mechanism based on Certification Authority (CA) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism adopts SIM authentication for terminal users and secure tunnel +certificates for servers. CA can resolve identity authentication problem of base station, assure security of base station and CA by secure tunnel in core networks. And current Challenge Handshake Protocol is also improved; challenge handshake exists in whole communication process which resolves connection robbing problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12208912","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Research on the Key Agreement and Authentication of Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the Key Agreement and Authentication of Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"pid1088842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029565S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","isNumber":"6006106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005185","articleId":"6006344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6006346,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhu","affiliation":["Oujiang College, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37290348300"},{"name":"Huaqing Mao","affiliation":["Oujiang College, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huaqing","lastName":"Mao","id":"37894606700"},{"name":"Dongsong Zheng","affiliation":["Oujiang College, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongsong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37892671600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7255-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7253-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7254-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6006346","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Authentication","Conferences","Software","Software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal analysis","cognitive radio networks","wireless communication","unified security architecture","BAN logic analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006346","doi":"10.1109/ITAP.2011.6006346","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Internet Technology and Applications","abstract":"Rapid development of Wireless communication leads to more and more wireless standards appear, and security architecture of different standards are not compatible.

Taking finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter as an example, we implement a digital filter system by using Custom embedded Micro-Processor, programmable FIR macro module, coefficient-loader, clock manager and A/D or D/A controller and other modules. The self-programmable VDF can provide the best solution for realization of digital filter algorithms, which are the low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop filter algorithms with variable frequency domain characteristics.

Current methods for controlling information technology (IT) and cooling technology (CT) in data centers are classified according to the degree to which they take into account both cyber and physical considerations. To evaluate the potential impact of coordinated CPS strategies at the data center level, we introduce a control-oriented model that represents the data center as two coupled networks: a computational network representing the cyber dynamics and a thermal network representing the physical dynamics. These networks are coupled through the influence of the IT on both networks: servers affect both the quality of service (QoS) delivered by the computational network and the generation of heat in the thermal network. Using this model, three control strategies are evaluated with respect to their energy efficiency and computational performance: a baseline strategy that ignores CPS considerations, an uncoordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT independently, and a coordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT together to achieve optimal performance with respect to both QoS and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the benefits to be realized from coordinating the control of IT and CT depend on the distribution and heterogeneity of the computational and cooling resources throughout the data center. A new cyber-physical index (CPI) is introduced as a measure of this combined distribution of cyber and physical effects in a given data center. We illustrate how the CPI indicates the potential impact of using coordinated CPS control strategies.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161244","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

We attribute the improved resistive switching to the GST thermal barrier, which induces thermally assisted electrochemical reduction of the Cu filament.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2163614","startPage":"1573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/6056714/06006505.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2011.2163614","endPage":"1575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of - Thermal Barrier on Reset Operations in Filament-Type Resistive Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Ge}_{2}\\hbox{Sb}_{2}\\hbox{Te}_{5}$ </tex></formula> Thermal Barrier on Reset Operations in Filament-Type Resistive Memory","volume":"32","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6006505/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12315660","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{Ge}_{2}\\hbox{Sb}_{2}\\hbox{Te}_{5}$ </tex></formula> Thermal Barrier on Reset Operations in Filament-Type Resistive Memory","sourcePdf":"led-lee-2163614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062365S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6056714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6056714","articleId":"6006505","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6006507,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Il Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Il","lastName":"Moon","id":"37322600700"},{"name":"Sung-Jin Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Jin","lastName":"Choi","id":"37310419800"},{"name":"Sungho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37309966900"},{"name":"Jae-Sub Oh","affiliation":["National Nanofab Center, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Sub","lastName":"Oh","id":"37405189200"},{"name":"Young-Su Kim","affiliation":["National Nanofab Center, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Su","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185544700"},{"name":"Yang-Kyu Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yang-Kyu","lastName":"Choi","id":"37277373300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6006507","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":609},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping","Silicon","Logic gates","Junctions","Impact ionization","Latches","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doping profiles","numerical analysis","resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertically integrated unidirectional biristor","unidirectional read-out characteristics","numerical simulations","base doping profile","multiplication factor","common-emitter gain","latch-up voltage","unidirectional conduction","crossbar-array configuration","reverse read direction","asymmetric base doping structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biristor","bistable resistor","bipolar junction transistor (BJT)","crossbar","open-base breakdown","two-terminal","vertical field-effect transistor (FET)"]}],"abstract":"The unidirectional read-out characteristics of a two-terminal biristor are investigated through numerical simulations and experiments. The base doping profile in the biristor, which is analogous to an open-base bipolar junction transistor (BJT), is a key parameter to control both the multiplication factor and the common-emitter gain of the open-base BJT. The simulated results indicate that the asymmetric base doping produces a difference in the latch-up voltage according to the reading direction. A unidirectional conduction path is thereby implemented in a crossbar-array configuration that consists of only the two-terminal biristor. The experimental results based on a vertical structure with local charge injection support that the leakage path through the reverse read direction can be blocked by the asymmetric base doping structure with the selection of proper bias conditions.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2011.2163698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device

Common to all approaches in that the temporal trajectories of the feature parameters are first transformed into the magnitude modulation spectrum. In spectral histogram equalization (SHE) and two-band spectral histogram equalization (2B-SHE), we equalize the histogram of the modulation spectrum for each utterance to a reference histogram obtained from clean training data, or perform the equalization with two sub-bands on the modulation spectrum. In magnitude ratio equalization (MRE), we define the magnitude ratio of lower to higher modulation frequency components for each utterance, and equalize this to a reference value obtained from clean training data. These approaches can be viewed as temporal filters that are adapted to each testing utterance. Experiments performed on the Aurora 2 and 4 corpora for small and large vocabulary tasks indicate that significant performance improvements are achievable for all noise conditions. We also show that additional improvements can be obtained when these approaches are integrated with cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN), histogram equalization (HEQ), higher order cepstral moment normalization (HOCMN), or the advanced front-end (AFE). We analyze and discuss the reasons for these improvements from different viewpoints with different sets of data, including adaptive temporal filtering, noise behavior on the modulation spectrum, phoneme types, and modulation spectrum distance measures.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2166544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6125258/06006516.pdf","startPage":"828","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2166544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Spectrum Equalization for Improved Robust Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006516/","displayDocTitle":"Modulation Spectrum Equalization for Improved Robust Speech Recognition","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12470256","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006516/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Spectrum Equalization for Improved Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-sun-2166544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170783S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6006516","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006525,"authors":[{"name":"Jibin Zou","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6022820/6006525/6006525-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jibin Zou (S'11) was born in Heilongjiang, China, in 1986.

The obtained model agrees well with the results of 3-D electrostatic numerical simulations.

An adaptive neural memoryless observer, in which the knowledge of time-delay is not used, is designed to estimate the system states. Furthermore, by applying the property of the function tanh\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(\u03d1/\u03b5)/\u03d1 (the function can be defined at \u03d1 = 0) and introducing a novel type appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, an adaptive output feedback controller is constructed via backstepping method which can efficiently avoid the problem of controller singularity and compensate for the time-delay. It is highly proven that the closed-loop systems controller designed by the NN-basis function property, new kind parameter adaptive law and Nussbaum function in detecting the control direction is able to guarantee the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals and the tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of zero. The characteristic of the proposed approach is that it relaxes any restrictive assumptions of Lipschitz condition for the unknown nonlinear continuous functions. And the proposed scheme is suitable for the systems with mismatching conditions and unmeasurable states. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12270591","pubMedId":"21880569","volume":"22","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural Networks-Based Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Time-Varying Delays Systems With Unknown Control Direction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Networks-Based Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Time-Varying Delays Systems With Unknown Control Direction","sourcePdf":"tnn-wen-2165222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101312S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6032791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"66","articleId":"6006530","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6006541,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Sh.

The proposed transform is used in a new orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( T-OFDM) system, leading to a significant improvement in bit error rate (BER) and reasonable reduction in the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Use of the proposed transform with OFDM has been found to attain high frequency diversity gain by combining all data samples resulting in the transmission over many subcarriers. Consequently, the detrimental effect arising from channel fading on the subcarrier power is minimized. Theoretical analysis of the uncoded T-OFDM performance over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), flat fading, quasi-static (fixed within the entire period of OFDM symbol transmission) frequency selective fading channel models with zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers is presented in this work. Moreover, the low superposition of the subcarriers passing through the T-transforms leads to a reduction in the high peak of the transmitted signal whilst preserving the average transmitted power and data rate. Analytical results confirmed by simulations demonstrated that the proposed T-OFDM system achieves lower PAPR and the same BER over AWGN and flat fading channels. Compared to OFDM, T-OFDM is found to have better BER when MMSE equalizer is used, but slightly worse when ZF equalizer is used.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2166551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06006541.pdf","startPage":"5994","endPage":"6007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2166551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Based on Low Complexity Transform to Increase Multipath Resilience and Reduce PAPR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006541/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Based on Low Complexity Transform to Increase Multipath Resilience and Reduce PAPR","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358034","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006541/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Based on Low Complexity Transform to Increase Multipath Resilience and Reduce PAPR","sourcePdf":"tsp-boussakta-2166551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085859S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6006541","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006542,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Di Lorenzo","affiliation":["Department of Information, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/6006542/6006542-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Di Lorenzo (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Rome \u201cSapienza\u201d, Italy, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

The equivalence between swarming and radio resource allocation is established by modeling the interference distribution in the resource domain, e.g., frequency and time, as the spatial distribution of food, while the position of the single bird represents the radio resource chosen by each radio node. The swarming mechanism is enforced by letting every node allocate its resources (power/bits) in the time-frequency regions where the interference is minimum (the food density is maximum), avoiding collisions with other nodes (birds), yet limiting the spread in the time-frequency domain (i.e., maintaining the swarm cohesion). The solution is given as the distributed minimization of a functional, borrowed from social foraging swarming models, containing the average interference plus repulsion and attraction terms that help to avoid conflicts and maintain cohesiveness, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06006542.pdf","startPage":"6160","endPage":"6174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2166549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2166549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Swarming Algorithm for Decentralized Access in Cognitive Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Time frequency analysis","Resource management","Birds","Markov processes","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","minimisation","radio access networks","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired swarming algorithm","decentralized access","cognitive radio","radio access mechanism","radio resource allocation","interference distribution","spatial distribution","food density","time-frequency domain","distributed minimization","social foraging swarming models","average interference plus repulsion","attraction terms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-inspired networks","cognitive radio","distributed resource allocation","social foraging swarms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-Inspired Swarming Algorithm for Decentralized Access in Cognitive Radio","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6006542/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358035","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-Inspired Swarming Algorithm for Decentralized Access in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"tsp-dilorenzo-2166549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072422S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6006542","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006543,"authors":[{"name":"Sha Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/6006543/6006543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sha Li received the B.Sc. degree in communications engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, P.R.

We make our implementation of these algorithms available publicly and perform numerical experiments demonstrating their speed and accuracy up to very high band-limits.

Typically, such inequalities quantify the likelihood that a random matrix will preserve the norm of a signal after multiplication. Concentration of measure results are well established for unstructured compressive matrices, populated with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random entries. Many real-world acquisition systems, however, are subject to architectural constraints that make such matrices impractical. In this paper we derive concentration of measure bounds for two types of block diagonal compressive matrices, one in which the blocks along the main diagonal are random and independent, and one in which the blocks are random but equal. For both types of matrices, we show that the likelihood of norm preservation depends on certain properties of the signal being measured, but that for the best case signals, both types of block diagonal matrices can offer concentration performance on par with their unstructured, i.i.d. counterparts. We support our theoretical results with illustrative simulations as well as analytical and empirical investigations of several signal classes that are highly amenable to measurement using block diagonal matrices. We also discuss applications of these results in ensuring stable embeddings for various signal families and in establishing performance guarantees for solving various signal processing tasks (such as detection and classification) directly in the compressed domain.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2166546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06006545.pdf","startPage":"5859","endPage":"5875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2166546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concentration of Measure for Block Diagonal Matrices With Applications to Compressive Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006545/","displayDocTitle":"Concentration of Measure for Block Diagonal Matrices With Applications to Compressive Signal Processing","volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358038","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006545/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concentration of Measure for Block Diagonal Matrices With Applications to Compressive Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"tsp-park-2166546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197786S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6006545","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006550,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Bae Seo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/6006550/6006550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Bae Seo (M'11) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Korea, 2000 and 2003, respectively.

Additionally, we consider access prioritization schemes to provide differential performance by controlling various system parameters. We show that controlling the persistence value as specified in UMTS is effective in both backoff algorithms. The performances with and without access prioritization schemes are presented in terms of throughput, mean, and variance of packet retransmission delay, packet-dropping probability, and system stability. Finally, we consider a dynamic window assignment algorithm that is based on Bayesian broadcasting, in which the base station adaptively controls the window size of the UB algorithm under unsaturated traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed window assignment algorithm outperforms fixed window assignment in static and dynamic traffic conditions under the assumption of perfect orthogonality between random-access codes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2166569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/06006550.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2166569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","startPage":"3975","endPage":"3989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Backoff Algorithms for Random Access Channels in UMTS-LTE and IEEE 802.16 Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Backoff Algorithms for Random Access Channels in UMTS-LTE and IEEE 802.16 Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291121","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006550/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Backoff Algorithms for Random Access Channels in UMTS-LTE and IEEE 802.16 Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-seo-2166569-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090494S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"6006550","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006551,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Tasca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6006551/6006551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Tasca was born in 1984 in Bergamo, Italy.

We examine the effect of input parameters and stimulus history upon SSA and show that the trends apparent in the results obtained in silico compare favorably with those observed in biological neurons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","volume":"5","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"12315646","pubMedId":"23852174","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006553/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Model of Stimulus-Specific Adaptation in Neuromorphic Analog VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model of Stimulus-Specific Adaptation in Neuromorphic Analog VLSI","sourcePdf":"tbcas-mill-2163155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079484S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6058665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6058665","articleId":"6006553","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6006559,"authors":[{"name":"Lap K.

Unlike conventional PEEC-based models, the proposed formulation accounts for the radiation effect by introducing physically meaningful complex-valued inductors and pure real-valued capacitors. In essence, the imaginary part of such an inductor represents a frequency-dependent radiation resistance. Having introduced the complex inductance, there is no inversion of the complex matrix of coefficients of potential, which is not physically meaningful and inevitably creates negative resistance. It is proven in this paper that the imaginary part of the generalized complex inductance for a short dipole exactly reflects the radiation resistance of the dipole. Several numerical examples are given to validate the proposed theory. The results obtained are in good agreement with those from commercial full-wave EM solvers, showing the potential of this technique for analyzing and designing high-frequency and high-speed electronic devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6041064/06006559.pdf","startPage":"2377","endPage":"2384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2163803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2163803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) Modeling With Radiation Effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Inductance","Capacitance","Radiation effects","Mathematical model","Resistance","Dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","equivalent circuits","inductance","inductors","radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized partial element equivalent circuit modeling","radiation effect","frequency-domain formulation","generalized complex partial inductance","pure real capacitance","3D structures","PEEC-based model","complex-valued inductors","pure real-valued capacitors","frequency-dependent radiation resistance","generalized complex inductance","dipole","commercial full-wave EM solvers","high-frequency electronic devices","high-speed electronic devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna","partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC)","partial inductance","radiation resistance","signal integrity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) Modeling With Radiation Effect","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6006559/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288013","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) Modeling With Radiation Effect","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wu-2163803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080067S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6041064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6041064","articleId":"6006559","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006564,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

Economic deployment of DERs is meant to select optimal locations, optimal sizes, and optimal technologies. Optimal locations and sizes, which are independent of CHP-based DERs types, are selected, here, by loss sensitivity index (LSI) and by loss minimization using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, respectively.

So the main focus of the present paper is to incorporate originality in ideas to evaluate how different optimal output sets of DER-mix, operating within their respective capacity limits, could share an electrical tracking demand, economically, among micro-turbines and diesel generators of various sizes, satisfying different heat demands, on the basis of multi-objective optimization compromising between fuel cost and emission in a 4-DER 14-bus radial micro-grid. Optimization is done using differential evolution (DE) technique under real power demand equality constraint, heat balance inequality constraint, and DER capacity limits constraint. DE results are compared with PSO.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6133486/06006566.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2162754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2162754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planned Scheduling for Economic Power Sharing in a CHP-Based Micro-Grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Density estimation robust algorithm","Fuels","Optimization","Economics","Generators","Resistance heating","Cogeneration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","cogeneration","diesel-electric generators","distributed power generation","minimisation","nitrogen compounds","particle swarm optimisation","power distribution economics","power distribution planning","power generation economics","power generation planning","power generation scheduling","turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic power sharing","CHP-based microgrid","scheduling planning","combined heat and power-based microgrid","distributed energy resource","loss sensitivity index","LSI","loss minimization","particle swarm optimization method","PSO method","electrical tracking demand","microturbine","diesel generator","multi-objective optimization","4-DER 14-bus radial micro-grid","differential evolution technique","DE technique","power demand equality constraint","heat balance inequality constraint","DER capacity limit constraint","NOx"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diesel generator","differential evolution","economic emission load dispatch","loss sensitivity index","micro-turbine","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Planned Scheduling for Economic Power Sharing in a CHP-Based Micro-Grid","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6006566/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12479039","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planned Scheduling for Economic Power Sharing in a CHP-Based Micro-Grid","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-basu-2162754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114139S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6133486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"6133486","articleId":"6006566","onlineDate":"30 August 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006567,"authors":[{"name":"Niamh Troy","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic, and Mechanical Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Niamh Troy (M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in applied physics from the University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.

While increasing the voltage level of a single cell is fast and simple, reducing the level of a cell requires the erasing of the entire block containing the cell. Since block-erasures are costly, flash coding schemes have been developed to maximize the number of writes before a block-erasure is needed. A novel coding scheme based on error-correcting codes is presented that allows the cell levels to increase as evenly as possible and as a result, increases the number of writes before a block-erasure. The scheme is based on the premise that cells whose levels are higher than others need not be increased. This introduces errors in the recorded data which can be corrected by an error-correcting code provided that the number of erroneous cells is within the error-correcting capability of the code. The scheme is also capable of combating noise, causing additional errors and erasures, in flash memories in order to enhance data reliability. For added flexibility, the scheme can be combined with other flash codes to yield concatenated schemes of high memory rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6006576/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12206739","volume":"57","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Codes for Flash Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Codes for Flash Coding","sourcePdf":"tit-abdelghaffar-2162262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162968S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6006580,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Jiang","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Jiang received the B.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1998 and 2002, respectively.","Since July 2002, he has been with the Graduate School of Shenzhen of Tsinghua University, Guangdong, China.

Spectral loss occurs in nonlinear fiber-optic channels and it may be one effect that needs to be taken into account to explain the behavior of the capacity of nonlinear fiber-optic channels.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2162187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6006569/06006582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2162187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006569","startPage":"5720","endPage":"5736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of Mutual Information for Partially Coherent Gaussian Channels With Applications to Fiber Optics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of Mutual Information for Partially Coherent Gaussian Channels With Applications to Fiber Optics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206744","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006582/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of Mutual Information for Partially Coherent Gaussian Channels With Applications to Fiber Optics","sourcePdf":"tit-goebel-2162187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15295S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006583,"authors":[{"name":"Leonard H.

A sequential adaptive sampling-and-refinement procedure called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed and analyzed. DS is a form of multistage experimental design and testing. Because of the adaptive nature of the data collection, DS can detect and localize far weaker signals than possible from non-adaptive measurements. In particular, reliable detection and localization (support estimation) using non-adaptive samples is possible only if the signal amplitudes grow logarithmically with the problem dimension. Here it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible provided the amplitude exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when the amplitude exceeds any arbitrarily slowly growing function of the dimension.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6006569/06006586.pdf","startPage":"6222","endPage":"6235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2162269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2162269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006569","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distilled Sensing: Adaptive Sampling for Sparse Detection and Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Sensors","Reliability","Extraterrestrial measurements","Adaptation models","Estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","amplitude estimation","Gaussian noise","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distilled sensing","sparse detection","sparse estimation","sparse signal recovery","white Gaussian noise","sequential adaptive sampling-and-reflnement procedure","multistage experimental design","multistage experimental testing","data collection","nonadaptive measurement","signal amplitude"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive sampling","experimental design","multiple hypothesis testing","sequential sensing","sparse recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distilled Sensing: Adaptive Sampling for Sparse Detection and Estimation","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6006586/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206748","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distilled Sensing: Adaptive Sampling for Sparse Detection and Estimation","sourcePdf":"tit-haupt-2162269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0696S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006589,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni (DIBET), Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Marco Baldi (M'09) was born in Macerata, Italy, in 1979.

In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize (w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up to a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n/\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n) term, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>\n is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied.

Existing work on cross-layer optimization for wireless networks often adopts simplistic physical-layer models for wireless channels, such as treating interference as noise or interference avoidance. This crude modeling of physical layer often leads to inefficient utilization of resources. In this paper, we adopt a deterministic channel model proposed in , , a simple abstraction of the physical layer that effectively captures the effect of channel strength, broadcast and superposition in wireless channels. This model allows us to go beyond \u201ctreating interference as noise\u201d and as a consequence are able to achieve higher throughput and utility. Within the network utility maximization (NUM) framework, we study the cross-layer optimization for wireless networks based on this deterministic channel model. First, we extend the well-studied conflict graph model to capture the flow interactions over the deterministic channels and characterize the feasible rate region. Then we study distributed algorithms for general wireless multi-hop networks with both link-centric formulation and node-centric formulation. The convergence of algorithms is proved by applying Lyapunov stability theorem and stochastic approximation method. Further, we show the convergence to the bounded neighborhood of optimal solutions with probability one under constant step sizes and constant update intervals. Our numerical evaluations validate the analytical results and show the advantage of deterministic channel model over simple physical layer models such as treating interference as noise.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2162265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6006569/06006605.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2162265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006569","startPage":"5840","endPage":"5862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Wireless Networks With Deterministic Channel Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006605","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Wireless Networks With Deterministic Channel Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206767","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Optimization for Wireless Networks With Deterministic Channel Models","sourcePdf":"tit-shao-2162265-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075814S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6006605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006606,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Shen","affiliation":["Qualcomm Research and Development, San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Cong Shen (S'02\u2013M'09) received his B.E. and M.S. degrees, in 2002 and 2004 respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China, and his Ph.D. degree in 2009 from the Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

In this paper, the diversity benefit of user cooperation is evaluated using diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) as the performance metric. Ways of exploiting the diversity benefit are devised. We investigate two typical channel models, namely, the multiple-access channel (MAC) and the interference channel (IFC). For the MAC, all the terminals are equipped with multiple antennas and the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n(\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n \u2265 2) sources cooperate in a full-duplex mode. We determine the optimal DMT of the channel and propose a compressed-and-forward (CF) based cooperation scheme to achieve the optimal DMT. For the IFC, we consider a two-user channel with single-antenna terminals and full-duplex source cooperation. A DMT upper bound and two DMT lower bounds are derived. The upper bound is derived based on a channel capacity upper bound, and the lower bounds are derived using decode-and-forward (DF) based cooperation schemes. In most channel scenarios, the bounds are found to be tight. This implies that under certain channel scenarios, the optimal DMT of the channel can be achieved by DF-based cooperation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006612/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206774","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Wireless Communication Systems With User Cooperation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Wireless Communication Systems With User Cooperation","sourcePdf":"tit-li-2161925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120862S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006613,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiyin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Shuiyin Liu (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree in communications and signal processing from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2007.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at Imperial College London.

To improve its performance, this paper presents randomized lattice decoding based on Klein's sampling technique, which is a randomized version of Babai's nearest plane algorithm [i.e., successive interference cancelation (SIC)] and samples lattice points from a Gaussian-like distribution over the lattice. To find the closest lattice point, Klein's algorithm is used to sample some lattice points and the closest among those samples is chosen. Lattice reduction increases the probability of finding the closest lattice point, and only needs to be run once during preprocessing. Further, the sampling can operate very efficiently in parallel. The technical contribution of this paper is twofold: we analyze and optimize the decoding radius of sampling decoding resulting in better error performance than Klein's original algorithm, and propose a very efficient implementation of random rounding. Of particular interest is that a fixed gain in the decoding radius compared to Babai's decoding can be achieved at polynomial complexity. The proposed decoder is useful for moderate dimensions where sphere decoding becomes computationally intensive, while lattice reduction-aided decoding starts to suffer considerable loss. Simulation results demonstrate near-ML performance is achieved by a moderate number of samples, even if the dimension is as high as 32.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2162180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6006569/06006613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2162180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006569","startPage":"5933","endPage":"5945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding by Sampling: A Randomized Lattice Algorithm for Bounded Distance Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6006613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding by Sampling: A Randomized Lattice Algorithm for Bounded Distance Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206775","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding by Sampling: A Randomized Lattice Algorithm for Bounded Distance Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-ling-2162180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085231S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006615,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nan Ma (S'06) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and will received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Boston University in 2011.

It uses a probability model to map any source string to a unique integer, and thereby defines an enumeration of all possible strings. Contrary to normal enumerative coding, the new method is noncombinatorial and operates sequentially, incrementing the code value symbol by symbol, by simple arithmetic. It is akin to arithmetic coding but does not use intervals. For memoryless sources, the redundancy per symbol is shown to be asymptotically less than \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n bits, where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n is the smaller of symbol probabilities. Especially, for integer-valued 1/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n , the code is asymptotically optimal. These results are confirmed by both analysis and experiments with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. In a practical implementation, the source is partitioned into substrings enabling restricted-precision arithmetic. Thanks to subtle implicit coding, the additional redundancy is marginal. The source model can be also context-based, and even adaptivity can be incorporated. A peculiarity of the method is that decoding is done backwards (LIFO). Hence, for higher-order models, the string suffix, not prefix, is used as the context domain. The speed of the practical version is close to that of binary arithmetic coders.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6006617/","accessionNumber":"12206779","displayDocTitle":"Nonblock Coding of Binary Sources by Probabilistic Enumeration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonblock Coding of Binary Sources by Probabilistic Enumeration","sourcePdf":"tit-teuhola-2161910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089186S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6006620,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad H.

This paper explores ideas for fast LP decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. By modifying the previously reported Adaptive LP decoding scheme to allow removal of unnecessary constraints, we first prove that LP decoding can be performed by solving a number of LP problems that each contains at most one linear constraint derived from each of the parity-check constraints. By exploiting this property, we study a sparse interior-point implementation for solving this sequence of linear programs. Since the most complex part of each iteration of the interior-point algorithm is the solution of a (usually ill-conditioned) system of linear equations for finding the step direction, we propose a preconditioning algorithm to facilitate solving such systems iteratively. The proposed preconditioning algorithm is similar to the encoding procedure of LDPC codes, and we demonstrate its effectiveness via both analytical methods and computer simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6006620/","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6006620/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12206782","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation of Linear Programming Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation of Linear Programming Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-taghavi-2161920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103682S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6006569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6006569","articleId":"6006620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6006623,"authors":[{"name":"David P.

From a Bayesian perspective, this process is equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using a sparsity-inducing prior distribution (Type I estimation). Using variational techniques, this distribution can always be conveniently expressed as a maximization over scaled Gaussian distributions modulated by a set of latent variables. Alternative Bayesian algorithms, which operate in latent variable space leveraging this variational representation, lead to sparse estimators reflecting posterior information beyond the mode (Type II estimation). Currently, it is unclear how the underlying cost functions of Type I and Type II relate, nor what relevant theoretical properties exist, especially with regard to Type II. Herein a common set of auxiliary functions is used to conveniently express both Type I and Type II cost functions in either coefficient or latent variable space facilitating direct comparisons. In coefficient space, the analysis reveals that Type II is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation using a particular class of dictionary- and noise-dependent, nonfactorial coefficient priors. One prior (at least) from this class maintains several desirable advantages over all possible Type I methods and utilizes a novel, nonconvex approximation to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n norm with most, and in certain quantifiable conditions all, local minima smoothed away.

A series of results, parallel to those for weight distributions, is established for second-order weight distributions. In particular, an analogue of MacWilliams identities is proved. The second-order weight distributions of regular LDPC code ensembles are then computed. As easy consequences, the second moments of weight distributions of regular LDPC code ensembles are obtained. Furthermore, the application of second-order weight distributions in random coding approach is discussed. The second-order weight distributions of the ensembles generated by a so-called 2-good random generator or parity-check matrix are computed, where a 2-good random matrix is a kind of generalization of the uniformly distributed random matrix over a finite filed and is very useful for solving problems that involve pairwise or triple-wise properties of sequences.

List decoding algorithms, capable of decoding beyond half the minimum distance, are based on interpolation and factorization of multivariate polynomials. This article provides a link between syndrome-based decoding approaches based on Key Equations and the interpolation-based list decoding algorithms of Guruswami and Sudan for Reed-Solomon codes. The original interpolation conditions of Guruswami and Sudan for Reed-Solomon codes are reformulated in terms of a set of Key Equations. These equations provide a structured homogeneous linear system of equations of Block-Hankel form, that can be solved by an adaption of the Fundamental Iterative Algorithm.

The detector determines the most contributive N\u2208{1,2} terms in each of the two log-sum-exponents. The objective function of the tree search is modified to account for (a) the channel estimation error variance and (b) the input a priories. Due to (a), the decomposition of the objective into the form used in conventional tree search is not possible. Moreover, both (a) and (b) invalidate the use of the progressive zigzag order. Because of this, a generalized Schnorr-Euchner enumeration is proposed where explicit sorting is done. Unlike the conventional tree search, the node weights are not computed in an additive way where the weight of a child node is the sum of the weights of the parent and the branch connecting them. The advantage of the proposed detectors compared to iterative channel estimation and decoding is that the repetition of the channel estimation and the QR decomposition is not needed. Also since they are based on the Schnorr-Euchner enumeration, they do not require an initial radius estimation and if channel estimation errors are small enough to be ignored, the search step becomes division- and square-root-free.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.090448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/06007020.pdf","endPage":"2807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Sphere Detectors for Imperfect Channel State Information","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.090448","startPage":"2796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Sphere Detectors for Imperfect Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007020/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317757","publicationDate":"October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007020/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Sphere Detectors for Imperfect Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"2796-tc1110-samuel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096608S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"6007020","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007022,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Ho Chae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6062271/6007022/6007022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung Ho Chae (S'08) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Information and Communications University (ICU), Korea, in 2005 and the M.S. degree with honors in Electrical Engineering from ICU in 2008.

An array of polarimetric antennas, each composed of three orthogonal electric dipoles and three orthogonal magnetic dipoles in which all six elements are co-located, is used throughout this paper. For a K-user LOS IC with single polarization, the maximum achievable MUXG is only K, regardless of the number of transmit and receive antennas at each node due to the key-hole effect. If polarimetric antennas are used at each node, a trivial upper bound on the MUXG is now 2K. In this paper, we consider zero-forcing (ZF) and interference alignment (IA) schemes to achieve this upper bound. We show the optimal MUXG of 2K is achievable if M \u2265 ((K+1)/6) polarimetric antennas are used at each node for any K. In addition, using the proposed ZF scheme, we obtain minimal dipole configurations at each node that achieve this upper bound for K <; 5. Furthermore, we analyze achievable MUXGs using the distributed interference alignment (DIA) algorithm. Although IA can generally provide a higher MUXG than ZF for LOS ICs, we observe that the number of required dipole elements to achieve the optimal MUXG of 2K under a ZF scheme is the same as that required under IA for all cases we consider.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Multiplexing Gain of K-user Line-of-Sight Interference Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.100126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/06007022.pdf","startPage":"2905","endPage":"2915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.100126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Multiplexing Gain of K-user Line-of-Sight Interference Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6007022/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317758","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Multiplexing Gain of K-user Line-of-Sight Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"2905-tc1110-chae.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092481S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"6007022","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007023,"authors":[{"name":"Cagatay Candan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cagatay","lastName":"Candan","id":"37449269100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6007023","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007023","abstract":"A novel two-stage frequency domain channel estimation method especially suitable for the estimation of long channels such as ultra wide band channels is proposed.

In this paper an information-theoretic framework is proposed to study communication systems which provide heterogeneous reliabilities for the users. This is done by defining individual probabilities of error for the users in the network and obtaining their fundamental tradeoffs. Using this framework, a system can be realized, which can provide a tradeoff of reliabilities among the users for a fixed vector of users' rates. This adds a completely new dimension to the performance tradeoff in such networks, which is beyond what is given by the conventional performance versus rate tradeoff in single-user systems. Although this is a very general concept and can be applied to any multi-terminal communication system, in this paper we consider multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading broadcast channel. In particular, we quantify the reliability tradeoff by introducing the notion of diversity gain region (DGR), which specifies the set of diversity gain vectors that are simultaneously achievable by the users for a fixed vector of users' multiplexing gains. We show the existence of a tradeoff among the users' diversity gains by deriving inner and outer bounds for the DGR.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.082111.100297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6062271/06007027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.082111.100297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062271","startPage":"2716","endPage":"2728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity Gain Regions for MIMO Fading Broadcast Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Gain Regions for MIMO Fading Broadcast Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2011","accessionNumber":"12317760","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Gain Regions for MIMO Fading Broadcast Channels","sourcePdf":"2716-tc1110-weng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105315S","chronDate":"October  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6062271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6062271","articleId":"6007027","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007028,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6085845/6007028/6007028-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Gong received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and mathematics (minor) from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2008.

Each transmitter encodes its information into multiple layers and transmits the superposition of those layers. Each receiver employs a constrained partial group decoder (CPGD) that decodes its designated message along with a part of the interference. In particular, each receiver performs a twofold task by first identifying which interferers it should decode and then determining which layers of them should be decoded. Determining the layers to be decoded and decoding them are carried out in a successive manner, where in each step a group of layers with a constraint on its group size is identified and jointly decoded while the remaining layers are treated as Gaussian noise. The decoded layers are then subtracted from the received signal and the same procedure is repeated for the remaining layers. We provide a distributed algorithm, tailored to the nature of the interference channels, that determines the transmission rate at each transmitter based on some optimality measure and also finds the order of the layers to be successively decoded at each receiver. We also consider practical design of a system that employs the quadrature amplitude modulations (QAM) and rateless codes. Numerical results are provided on the achievable sum-rate under the ideal case of Gaussian signaling with random codes as well as on the system throughput under practical modulations and channel codes. The results show that the proposed multi-layer coding scheme with CPGD offers significant performance gain over the traditional un-layered transmission with single-user decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.082111.100624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06007028.pdf","startPage":"3059","endPage":"3071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.082111.100624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Channel with Constrained Partial Group Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007028/","displayDocTitle":"Interference Channel with Constrained Partial Group Decoding","volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388280","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007028/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Channel with Constrained Partial Group Decoding","sourcePdf":"3059-tc1111-gong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069435S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6007028","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007030,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Hrycak","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Tomasz Hrycak received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University.

We derive explicit formulas for the BEM coefficients in terms of the receive signal. Algebraically, the algorithm is FFT-based, and can be easily implemented in hardware. For a system with L channels taps, our method uses O(L log L) operations and O(L) memory per OFDM symbol. This complexity is the best possible up to the order of magnitude.

Different from previous work in the literature, we introduce an additional degree of freedom at the encoder, MMSE decoding instead of ML decoding is considered, and we focus on both high and low channel signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR) regions. By using MMSE decoding, the proposed system presents a performance very close to the theoretical limits, even at low CSNR, as long as the system parameters are properly optimized. Then, N:K bandwidth compression systems are constructed by parallel combination of an M:1 system and a 1:1 uncoded system, and the optimal power allocation between the two constituent systems is derived in order to maximize the overall output signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). Finally, 1:2 bandwidth expansion systems using mapping functions similar to those used in 2:1 system are investigated. Different from digital systems, the proposed scheme does not require long block lengths to achieve good performance, and shows graceful degradation when the CSNR is lower than the one used for the design.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.090298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6085845/06007031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.090298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6085845","startPage":"3016","endPage":"3026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Non-Linear Curves and MMSE Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analog Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Non-Linear Curves and MMSE Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12388283","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007031/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Non-Linear Curves and MMSE Decoding","sourcePdf":"3016-tc1111-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077552S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6085845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6085845","articleId":"6007031","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007034,"authors":[{"name":"Huicong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6031170/6007034/6007034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huicong Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

The whole chip was assembled onto a metal carrier with a limited spacer such that the operation frequency bandwidth can be widened to 17 Hz at the input acceleration of 1.0 g during frequency up-sweep. Load voltage and power generation for different numbers of PZT elements in series and in parallel connections were compared and discussed based on experimental and simulation results. Moreover, the EH device has a wideband and steadily increased power generation from 19.4 nW to 51.3 nW within the operation frequency bandwidth ranging from 30 Hz to 47 Hz at 1.0 g.

In this paper, we introduce a new code property of STC called block-orthogonal property, which can be exploited by QR-decomposition-based decoders to achieve significant decoding complexity reduction without performance loss. We show that such complexity reduction principle can benefit the existing algebraic codes such as Perfect and DjABBA codes due to their inherent (but previously undiscovered) block-orthogonal property. In addition, we construct and optimize new full-rate block-orthogonal STC (BOSTC) that further maximize the QRDM complexity reduction potential. Simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance against decoding complexity show that the new BOSTC outperforms all previously known codes as long as the QRDM decoder operates in reduced-complexity mode, and the code exhibits a desirable complexity saturation property.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2166755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6069495/06007039.pdf","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2166755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Code Structure and Its Impact on QRDM Decoding Complexity Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007039/","displayDocTitle":"Block-Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Code Structure and Its Impact on QRDM Decoding Complexity Reduction","volume":"5","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360020","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007039/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Orthogonal Space\u2013Time Code Structure and Its Impact on QRDM Decoding Complexity Reduction","sourcePdf":"jstsp-guan-2166755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116065S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6007039","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6007042,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco M.

The capital cost of the electrical network that supports a large offshore wind farm constitutes a significant proportion of the total cost of the wind farm. Thus, finding the optimal design of this electrical network is an important task, a task that is addressed in this paper. A cost model has been developed that includes a more realistic treatment of the cost of transformers, transformer substations, and cables. These improvements make this cost model more detailed than others that are currently in use. A novel solution algorithm is used. This algorithm is based on an improved genetic algorithm and includes a specific algorithm that considers different cable cross sections when designing the radial arrays. The proposed approach is tested with a large offshore wind farm; this testing has shown that the proposed algorithm produces valid optimal electrical network designs.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2011.2163027","startPage":"164","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/6155170/06007042.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2163027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Electric Network Design for a Large Offshore Wind Farm Based on a Modified Genetic Algorithm Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind farms","Substations","Wind turbines","Optimization","Encoding","Biological cells","Investments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power cables","transformer substations","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal electric network design","offshore wind farm","modified genetic algorithm approach","electrical network","transformer substations","cables","radial arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric distribution system","genetic algorithm","offshore wind farm","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Electric Network Design for a Large Offshore Wind Farm Based on a Modified Genetic Algorithm Approach","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6007042/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12543358","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Electric Network Design for a Large Offshore Wind Farm Based on a Modified Genetic Algorithm Approach","sourcePdf":"jsyst-gonzalezlongatt-2163027-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098677S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6155170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6155170","articleId":"6007042","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007044,"authors":[{"name":"Kranthimanoj Nagothu","affiliation":["University of Texas, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6155170/6007044/6007044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kranthimanoj Nagothu (S'07) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2006, and the M.S.E.E. degree from the University of Texas, San Antonio, in 2009.

Our approach uses cloud computing data center as the central communication and optimization infrastructure supporting a cognitive radio network of AMI meters which we label netbook advance metering infrastructure (Net-AMI). The Net-AMI is a novel low cost infrastructure of AMI meters that operate akin to netbooks with wireless transceiver that access to cloud data center energy services, cognitive radio services, and wireless communication services. Access occurs via cognitive radios channels. We claim that this solution solves the important problem in smart grid systems of how to develop an extensible, persistent, smart grid information network with a lifespan equivalent to that of most power systems (20-30 years). By persistence, we imply always operable, entirely software upgradeable, and independent of cellular networks. Our system is extensible and can easily handle thousands of variations in power systems, communication protocols, control, and energy optimization protocols. We formulate necessary link analysis and optimum scheduling of downlink and uplink Net-AMI packets in a multiuser cognitive radio environment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2162794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155170","startPage":"4","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/6155170/06007044.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Persistent Net-AMI for Microgrid Infrastructure Using Cognitive Radio on Cloud Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007044/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Persistent Net-AMI for Microgrid Infrastructure Using Cognitive Radio on Cloud Data Centers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543360","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Persistent Net-AMI for Microgrid Infrastructure Using Cognitive Radio on Cloud Data Centers","sourcePdf":"jsyst-nagothu-2162794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11707S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6155170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6155170","articleId":"6007044","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007045,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Yousuf Saber","affiliation":["Research and Development Department, ETAP, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6155170/6007045/6007045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Yousuf Saber (S'04\u2013M'07\u2013SM'10) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.","He served as an Assistant Professor with the University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, and King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Renewable energy sources (RESs), mainly wind and solar, can reduce emissions from the electric energy sector; however, they are very intermittent. Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants) and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commitment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the forecasted one. Thus, UC with plug-in vehicles under uncertainty in a smart grid is very complex considering smart charging and discharging to and from various energy sources and loads to reduce both cost and emissions. A set of valid scenarios is considered for the uncertainties of wind and solar energy sources, load and GVs. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the expected cost and emissions of the UC schedule for the set of scenarios. Results are presented indicating that the smart grid has the potential to maximally utilize RESs and GVs to reduce cost and emissions from the power system and transportation sector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007045/","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6007045/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12543361","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource Scheduling Under Uncertainty in a Smart Grid With Renewables and Plug-in Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Scheduling Under Uncertainty in a Smart Grid With Renewables and Plug-in Vehicles","sourcePdf":"jsyst-saber-2163012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155387S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6155170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"6155170","articleId":"6007045","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007046,"authors":[{"name":"Yue-Ying Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, P.

The circular polarization in the lower band is achieved by the slots loaded in two opposite corners, and the C-shape grounded strip can offer a current path for the upper band. A rectangular tuning stub protruded into the slot from the signal strip of the CPW is used to obtain good impedance matching over the whole frequency band. Axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth can be significantly enhanced through tuning the horizontal length of the C-shaped grounded strip. The antenna has been investigated numerically and experimentally. Experimental results show that the antenna possesses the measured 10-dB return loss impedance bandwidth of 106.9% (1.01-3.33 GHz).

It is a kind of light rail vehicle where the conventional wheel-rail track is substituted by a rail of Ne-Fe-B magnets and carbon steel interacting with superconductor bulks installed in the vehicle to promote levitation. The main cost of this levitation system is the magnetic rail. Therefore, any improvement in the shape and configuration of magnets and iron has a significant budgetary impact. In this paper, the optimizations carried out with the feasible direction interior point algorithm, extensive search, and genetic algorithm of magnetic rails are presented. The objective is to find the geometry that minimizes the total cost, for a given levitation force, considering some practical restrictions. The levitation force restriction is calculated using a finite-element method. During the optimization process, the superconductor null permeability model is used. Finally, the results are checked with the Bean model and verified experimentally. Measurements of the levitation force and the field mapped over the magnetic rails are presented. Significant reduction of soft and hard ferromagnetic materials was reached.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/6029382/06007057.pdf","startPage":"3548","endPage":"3554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2011.2161986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2011.2161986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a Linear Superconducting Levitation System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Superconducting magnets","Geometry","Rails","Optimization","Magnetic levitation","Force","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferromagnetic materials","finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","magnetic levitation","magnetic permeability","magnets","railway rolling stock"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear superconducting levitation system","Federal University of Rio de Janeiro","superconducting magnetic levitation urban train","MagLev-Cobra light rail vehicle","wheel-rail track","carbon steel","neon-iron-boron magnets","superconductor bulk","direction interior point algorithm","extensive search","genetic algorithm","finite element method","superconductor null permeability model","Bean model","soft ferromagnetic material","hard ferromagnetic material"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Levitation","optimization","superconductivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a Linear Superconducting Levitation System","volume":"21","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6007057/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245479","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a Linear Superconducting Levitation System","sourcePdf":"tasc-motta-2161986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069626S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"6029382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6029382","articleId":"6007057","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6007062,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Mirzaei","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6007062/6007062-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmad Mirzaei (M'06\u2013SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2006.","He is currently a Principal Scientist with Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA.

An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors. We derive the scaling laws between coverage, network density, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that data fusion can significantly improve sensing coverage by exploiting the collaboration among sensors when several physical properties of the target signal are known. In particular, for signal path loss exponent of (typically between 2.0 and 5.0), \u03c1\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</sub>\n = O(\u03c1\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1-1/k</sup>\n, where \u03c1\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</sub>\n and \u03c1\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</sub>\n are the densities of uniformly deployed sensors that achieve full coverage under the fusion and disc models, respectively. Moreover, data fusion can also reduce network density for regularly deployed networks and mobile networks where mobile sensors can relocate to fill coverage holes. Our results help understand the limitations of the previous analytical results based on the disc model and provide key insights into the design of WSNs that adopt data fusion algorithms. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007065/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12673842","volume":"20","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Data Fusion to Improve the Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Data Fusion to Improve the Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-tan-2164620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124598S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6183048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6183048","articleId":"6007065","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007066,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Gao","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Gao","id":"37307925300"},{"name":"Deyuan Gao","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Deyuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37308083800"},{"name":"Christine Hu-Guo","affiliation":["Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert CURIEN, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Hu-Guo","id":"38271523900"},{"name":"Tingcun Wei","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Tingcun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37320076100"},{"name":"Yann Hu","affiliation":["Polytechnical University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Hu","id":"37308883100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"6007066","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1174},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Radiation detectors","Delay","Generators","Application specific integrated circuits","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated multichannel ramp ADC","digital DLL techniques","small animal PET imaging","analog-to-digital converter","small animal positron emission tomography","application-specific integrated circuit","LYSO scintillation crystals","multi-channel plate photodetectors","digital delay-locked loop","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","delay locked loop (DLL)","PET imaging","ramp ADC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007066","abstract":"This paper presents a novel design of an integrated 12-bit multi-channel single-slope ramp analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for a small animal positron emission tomography(PET) imaging system. The proposed ADC is a part of a monolithic front-end readout application-specific integrated circuit(ASIC) which is dedicated to the detector modules consisting of LYSO scintillation crystals read out on both sides by the multi-channel plate (MCP) photodetectors. The function of the ADC is to digitize the voltage signals from a large number of readout channels. Digital delay-locked loop (DLL) techniques are proposed to realize time interpolations in order to reduce the conversion time and to enhance the resolution. Both high precision and low power are obtained. An eight-channel prototype chip is implemented in AMS 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS technology. The available resolution of the ADC is 9 ~ 12 bits. The maximum DNL and INL of the fine conversion in the ADC is \u00b10.75 LSB and \u00b10.5 LSB, respectively. The static power consumption of the ADC is 3 mW + 0.2 mW/Channel. This ADC architecture provides a possibility to integrate low-noise front-end readout circuits, time-to-digital converters and ADC together into a monolithic ASIC and to output both the energy quantity and the time information with digital representations for PET imaging systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2163170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2163170","startPage":"2161","endPage":"2168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6041077/06007066.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Characteristics of an Integrated Multichannel Ramp ADC Using Digital DLL Techniques for Small Animal PET Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and Characteristics of an Integrated Multichannel Ramp ADC Using Digital DLL Techniques for Small Animal PET Imaging","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007066/","accessionNumber":"12288032","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007066/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Characteristics of an Integrated Multichannel Ramp ADC Using Digital DLL Techniques for Small Animal PET Imaging","sourcePdf":"tns-gao-2163170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087615S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6041077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6041077","articleId":"6007066","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007073,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6250311/6007073/6007073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Wang (S'09-M'10) was born in Chengdu, China, in 1982.

LR-PONs appear as efficient solutions having feeder distances around 100km and high split ratios up to 1000-way. On the other hand, transmission of the signals in long distances up to 100km leads to increased propagation delay whereas high split ratio may lead to long cycle times resulting in large queue occupancies and long packet delays. Before LR-PON becomes widely adopted, the trade-off between the advantages and performance degradation problem which is resulting from long reach and high split ratio properties of LR-PONs needs to be solved. Recent studies have focused on enhancing the performance of dynamic bandwidth allocation in LR-PONs. This article presents a comprehensive survey on the dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes for LR-PONs. In the article, a comparative classification of the proposed schemes based on their quality-of-service awareness, base-types, feeder distances and tested performance metrics is provided. At the end of the article, a brief discussion on the open issues and research challenges for the solution of performance degradation in LR-PONs is presented.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6250311/06007074.pdf","startPage":"714","endPage":"733","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.081511.00013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.081511.00013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6250311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Distribution Solutions for Performance Enhancement in Long-Reach Passive Optical Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2012","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Distribution Solutions for Performance Enhancement in Long-Reach Passive Optical Networks","htmlLink":"/document/6007074/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","accessionNumber":"12884104","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Distribution Solutions for Performance Enhancement in Long-Reach Passive Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"06kantarci.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151693S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6250311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6250311","articleId":"6007074","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007077,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Samdanis","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe, NEC Europe Limited, Heidelberg, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Konstantinos Samdanis is currently working as a Research Scientist at NEC Europe Ltd, Germany conducting research in the area of network management and Self-Organized Networks for eUTRAN and LTE-A, while he is also active in the field of energy efficient networking and green communication.

More specifically, emotions are elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states, that is, arousal and valence dimensions. A dedicated experimental protocol was designed and realized where specific affective states are suitably induced while three peripheral physiological signals, i.e., ElectroCardioGram (ECG), ElectroDermal Response (EDR), and ReSPiration activity (RSP), are simultaneously acquired. A group of 35 volunteers was presented with sets of images gathered from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence, including a neutral reference level in both. Standard methods as well as nonlinear dynamic techniques were used to extract sets of features from the collected signals. The goal of this paper is to implement an automatic multiclass arousal/valence classifier comparing performance when extracted features from nonlinear methods are used as an alternative to standard features.

The objective function employs parameterized models of computation and communication to represent the characteristics of processors, memories, and communications networks. The interaction of the latter microarchitectural elements defines global system performance in terms of energy-delay cost. Following the derivation, we demonstrate its utility by applying it to the problem of Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) architecture exploration. Given a set of application and architectural parameters, we solve for the optimal CMP architecture for six different architectural optimization examples. We find the parameters that minimize the total system cost, defined by the objective function under the area constraint of a single die. The analytical formulation presented in this paper is general and offers the foundation for the quantitative and rapid evaluation of computer architectures under different constraints including that of single die area.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6226550","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6226550/06007130.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond Amdahl's Law: An Objective Function That Links Multiprocessor Performance Gains to Delay and Energy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007130/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beyond Amdahl's Law: An Objective Function That Links Multiprocessor Performance Gains to Delay and Energy","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12819486","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Amdahl's Law: An Objective Function That Links Multiprocessor Performance Gains to Delay and Energy","sourcePdf":"ttc2012081110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161913S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6226550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6226550","articleId":"6007130","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007131,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Stoleru","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6163459/6007131/6007131-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Radu Stoleru received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Virginia in 2007, under Professor John A.

Recently, with the fast development of web 2.0, more and more documents are assigned by social users with emotion labels such as happiness, sadness, and surprise. Such emotions can provide a new aspect for document categorization, and therefore help online users to select related documents based on their emotional preferences. Useful as it is, the ratio with manual emotion labels is still very tiny comparing to the huge amount of web/enterprise documents. In this paper, we aim to discover the connections between social emotions and affective terms and based on which predict the social emotion from text content automatically. More specifically, we propose a joint emotion-topic model by augmenting Latent Dirichlet Allocation with an additional layer for emotion modeling. It first generates a set of latent topics from emotions, followed by generating affective terms from each topic. Experimental results on an online news collection show that the proposed model can effectively identify meaningful latent topics for each emotion. Evaluation on emotion prediction further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6007133/","displayDocTitle":"Mining Social Emotions from Affective Text","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining Social Emotions from Affective Text","sourcePdf":"ttk2012091658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080931S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6247403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6247403","articleId":"6007133","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007140,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37894318100"},{"name":"Mikhail J.

The previous best deterministic algorithm (developed by Gil and Kimmel, and refined by Coltuc) can compute the 1D max filter using 1.5+o(1) comparisons per sample in the worst case. The best-known algorithm for independent and identically distributed input uses 1.25+o(1) expected comparisons per sample (by Gil and Kimmel). In this work, we show that the number of comparisons can be reduced to 1+o(1) comparisons per sample in the worst case. As a consequence of the new max/min filters, the opening (or closing) filter can also be computed using 1+o(1) comparisons per sample in the worst case, where the previous best work requires 1.5+o(1) comparisons per sample (by Gil and Kimmel); and computing the max and min filters simultaneously can be done in 2+o(1) comparisons per sample in the worst case, where the previous best work (by Lemire) requires three comparisons per sample. Our improvements over the previous work are asymptotic, that is, the number of comparisons is reduced only when the window size is large.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6047995/06007140.pdf","startPage":"2544","endPage":"2548","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Running Max/Min Filters Using 1+o(1) Comparisons per Sample","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Running Max/Min Filters Using 1+o(1) Comparisons per Sample","volume":"33","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6007140/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301559","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","pubMedId":"21876226","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Running Max/Min Filters Using 1+o(1) Comparisons per Sample","sourcePdf":"ttp2011122544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064904S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6047995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6047995","articleId":"6007140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007148,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"38253166700"},{"name":"Yi-Jan Emery Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, and Graduate Institute of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Jan","lastName":"Emery Chen","id":"37087292634"},{"name":"Jau-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jau-Horng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280678200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6007148","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1185},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007148","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Degradation","Linearity","Power generation","Power measurement","Multiaccess communication","Microwave theory and techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","microwave amplifiers","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier efficiency","load mismatch","reflected power recycling","hybrid coupler","W-CDMA voice signal","radio transmitter","microwave amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifiers (PAs)","radio transmitters","microwave amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a method for improving the efficiency of a power amplifier (PA) under load mismatch by recycling the reflected power.

The MLP is one of the most commonly used networks. It can be used for classification problems, model construction, series forecasting and discrete control. For the forecasting problems, a backpropagation (BP) algorithm is normally used to train the MLP Neural Network. On the other hand, the SOM is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised data to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of an input space of training samples in a cell map. Historical data of real global load demand were used for the research. They were presented to the two neural networks as a daily load value, in hours, from the workdays of certain years. The load curves were obtained from the Spanish Electrical System Operator. For testing purposes, new year data were also collected. The main objective of the research is to use the capacity of MLP and SOM to classify and memorize historical data, followed by taking advantage of this memorization to identify similarities between the historical data and the demand of a new day corresponding to new year data. Certain pre-processing of the input data is needed in order to obtain good results as the demand evolves over the years. It is important to establish the measurement index used to check the accuracy of the tool. This index is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which measures the accuracy of fitted time series and forecasts. Different parameter configurations for the SOM and MLP training (training periods, algorithms, etc...) are also being tested to improve the behaviour of the forecast. The results of this analysis have proved the suitability of both networks to make short-term predictions, as good results are obtained when different methodologies are applied. These tools could assist Companies, Utilities and Independent System Operators (ISO) in predicting the short-term energy demand.","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 Modern Electric Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007154","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Modern Electric Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996359/6007154/06007170.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of self organizing maps vs. multilayer perceptron neural networks for short-term load forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007170/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of self organizing maps vs. multilayer perceptron neural networks for short-term load forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007170/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12218075","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of self organizing maps vs. multilayer perceptron neural networks for short-term load forecasting","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"paper042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114685S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5996359","isNumber":"6007154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996359","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6007154","articleId":"6007170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Institute of Electrical Power","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6007201,"authors":[{"name":"Xinzhou Dong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Power system, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinzhou","lastName":"Dong","id":"37281247900"},{"name":"Shiyong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Power system, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538886400"},{"name":"Shenxing Shi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Power system, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shenxing","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278530700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-921315-8-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-921315-7-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6007201","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":974},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Transient analysis","Power transmission lines","Time frequency analysis","Optical fiber subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transmission faults","power transmission lines","power transmission protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage fault traveling waves","line parameters","high voltage transmission lines","EHV/UHV long distance transmission line","distribution parameters","current fault travelling waves","fault superimposed voltage source","fault information","fault detection","characteristic analysis","pre-fault load travelling waves","post-fault fault travelling waves","fault transient travelling waves","fault steady-state travelling waves","time period","high-frequency wave-front","power frequency component","voltage transient travelling waves","direction protection theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transmission lines","voltage fault traveling waves","fault transient traveling waves","fault steady-state traveling waves","high frequency wave-front"]}],"abstract":"A Line parameters of high voltage transmission lines, especially of EHV/UHV long distance transmission line, have the characteristics of distribution parameters obviously.

The earliest one, and also the most popular one, is the Karnik-Mendel Algorithm, which is iterative and computationally intensive. In the last a few years researchers have proposed several other more efficient type-reduction algorithms. In this paper we also propose a new algorithm which improves over the latest results. Experiments show that it is the most efficient one to use in practice. Particularly, when the number of elements in type-reduction is smaller than 100, which is true in most practical type-reduction computations, our proposed algorithm can save over 50% computational cost over the Karnik Mendel Algorithms. We also give the Matlab implementation of our most efficient algorithm in the Appendix. It includes preprocessing steps to eliminate numerical problems, and also improved testing criteria to prevent possible infinite loops. This program will be very helpful in promoting the popularity of type 2 fuzzy sets and systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007317/","accessionNumber":"12327636","displayDocTitle":"Comparison and practical implementation of type-reduction algorithms for type-2 fuzzy sets and systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison and practical implementation of type-reduction algorithms for type-2 fuzzy sets and systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063458S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007318,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Jong","lastName":"Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Yi-Chang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Chang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089071758"},{"name":"Yung-Ruei Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Atomic Energy Council, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Ruei","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292171300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007318","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Fuzzy neural networks","Load modeling","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Load forecasting","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","load forecasting","power engineering computing","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term load forecasting","fuzzy neural network","varied learning rates","international market fluctuation","intelligent microgrid system","renewable energy sources","electrical supply"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy neural network","varied learning rates","short-term load forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007318","abstract":"Due to the lack of natural resources, the majority of energy in many countries must depend on import, and the corresponding cost is expensive and affected by international market fluctuation and control.

Finally, the simulation results have shown that the proposed CNFN-ISEL can outperform other methods.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007323","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2826","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007323.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An immune symbiotic evolution learning for compensatory neural fuzzy networks and its applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007323/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An immune symbiotic evolution learning for compensatory neural fuzzy networks and its applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007323/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327642","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An immune symbiotic evolution learning for compensatory neural fuzzy networks and its applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075487S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007330,"authors":[{"name":"Shing Chiang Tan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Multimedia University, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Shing Chiang","lastName":"Tan","id":"38258327100"},{"name":"Zuwarie Ibrahim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Zuwarie","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37303868100"},{"name":"Lee Wen Jau","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), University of Technology, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lee Wen","lastName":"Jau","id":"37593534800"},{"name":"Junzo Watada","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO), University of Technology, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Junzo","lastName":"Watada","id":"38292697300"},{"name":"Marzuki Khalid","affiliation":["ATTD Automation (APAC) Pathfinding Intel Technology Sdn.

In this paper, a variant of the supervised learning neural network from the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) family, i.e., Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) which is equipped with a conflict-resolving facility, is proposed to classify an imbalanced dataset that represents a real problem in the semiconductor industry. The FAM model is combined with the Dynamic Decay Adjustment (DDA) algorithm to form a hybrid FAMDDA network. The classification results of FAM and FAMDDA are presented, compared, and analyzed using several classification metrics. The outcomes positively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed FAMDDA network in undertaking classification problems with imbalanced datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007330/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327649","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007330/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning with imbalanced datasets using fuzzy ARTMAP-based neural network models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning with imbalanced datasets using fuzzy ARTMAP-based neural network models","confLoc":"Taipei","sourcePdf":"F0043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133948S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6007359,"authors":[{"name":"Keiichi Niwa","affiliation":["Faculty of Economics, Hiroshima University of Economics, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichi","lastName":"Niwa","id":"37337821300"},{"name":"Tomohiro Hayashida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Hayashida","id":"37891954400"},{"name":"Masatoshi Sakawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Sakawa","id":"37282530000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007359","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Programming","Pareto optimization","Program processors","Genetics","Decoding","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mathematical programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective two-level 0-1 programming","distributed genetic algorithm","optimistic anticipation","pessimistic anticipation","mathematical programming","Stackelberg solution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007359","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007359.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective two-level 0\u20131 programming through distributed genetic algorithms","abstract":"In this paper we focus on a multiobjective two-level 0-1 programming problem in which the decision maker at the upper level has an objective function and the decision maker at the lower level has multiple objective functions.

Traditional keyword-based search engines suffer several problems. First, synonyms and terms similar to keywords are not taken into consideration to search web pages. Users may need to input several similar keywords individually to complete a search. Second, traditional search engines treat all keywords as the same importance and cannot differentiate the importance of one keyword from that of another. Third, traditional search engines lack an applicable classification mechanism to reduce the search space and improve the search results. In this paper, we develop a fuzzy search engine, called Fuzzy-Go. First, a fuzzy ontology is constructed by using fuzzy logic to capture the similarities of terms in the ontology, which offering appropriate semantic distances between terms to accomplish the semantic search of keywords. The Fuzzy Go search engine can thus automatically retrieve web pages that contain synonyms or terms similar to keywords. Second, users can input multiple keywords with different degrees of importance based on their needs. The totally satisfactory degree of keywords can be aggregated based on their degrees of importance and degrees of satisfaction. Third, the domain classification of web pages offers users to select the appropriate domain for searching web pages, which excludes web pages in the inappropriate domains to reduce the search space and to improve the search results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing a fuzzy search engine based on fuzzy ontology and semantic search","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007378","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007378.pdf","startPage":"2684","endPage":"2689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Developing a fuzzy search engine based on fuzzy ontology and semantic search","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007378/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12327697","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a fuzzy search engine based on fuzzy ontology and semantic search","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050702S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007385,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Feng Zhang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Xue-Feng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898425100"},{"name":"Miyuki Koshimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Miyuki","lastName":"Koshimura","id":"37601567400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Fujita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37593584100"},{"name":"Ryuzo Hasegawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuzo","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37605582700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007385","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Job shop scheduling","Schedules","Optimization","Cooling","Algorithm design and analysis","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","job shop scheduling","minimisation","particle swarm optimisation","probability","search problems","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm","job shop scheduling problem","maximum makespan minimization","hybrid heuristic","tabu search","simulated annealing","local search","global search","memory function","horizontal direction calculation","probability","cooling schedule","vertical direction calculation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Job Shop Scheduling Problem","Particle Swarm Optimization","Tabu Search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007385","abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP) to minimize the maximum makespan. A new hybrid heuristic, based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA), is presented. PSO combines local search (by self-experience) with global search (by neighboring experience), achieving a high search efficiency. TS uses a memory function to avoid being trapped at a local minimum, and has emerged as an effective algorithmic approach for the JSSP. This method can also be referred to as calculation of the horizontal direction. SA employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and the search process can be controlled by the cooling schedule (also known as calculation of vertical direction). By reasonably combining these three different search algorithms, we develop a robust, fast and simply implemented hybrid optimization algorithm HPTS (Hybrid of Particle swarm optimization, Tabu search and Simulated annealing). This hybrid algorithm is applied to the standard benchmark sets and compared with other approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm could obtain the high-quality solutions within relatively short computation time. For 6 of 43 instances, new upper bounds among the unsolved problems are found in a short time in HPTS.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007385","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007385.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"626","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient hybrid particle swarm optimization for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An efficient hybrid particle swarm optimization for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12327704","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007385/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient hybrid particle swarm optimization for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100577S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007436,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Villar","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Villar","id":"37739694900"},{"name":"Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ja\u00e9n, Jaen, Spain"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Fern\u00e1ndez","id":"37592636500"},{"name":"Francisco Herrera","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Herrera","id":"37270827700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007436","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007436","abstract":"This paper studies the behavior of a multiobjective Genetic Algorithm for jointly performing a feature selection and granularity learning for Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems in the scenario of imbalanced data-sets.

We consider two different measures, one for the precision of the model and other for its complexity as the two objectives to optimize.

It is shown that such two fuzzy approaches are same.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007459","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007459.pdf","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy approaches for multiobjective stochastic linear programming problems considering both probability maximization and fractile optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007459/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy approaches for multiobjective stochastic linear programming problems considering both probability maximization and fractile optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12327778","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007459/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy approaches for multiobjective stochastic linear programming problems considering both probability maximization and fractile optimization","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080821S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007473,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, MSAR, University of Macau, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899861300"},{"name":"Chi-Hsu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hsu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37336440400"},{"name":"C.

To achieve symbiotic evolution, SNEA first establishes a neuron population where each neuron is randomly created, and evaluates the neurons by constructing NNs with different numbers of neurons. Each neuron shares fitness from participating NNs. This algorithm then performs evolution on the neuron population by crossover and mutation based on neuron fitness. An NNAGM designed by SNEA is applied to the prediction problems and compared with other methods.

As a renewable power source, solar power is injected stochastically with the model. To handle the uncertainty and intermittency involved while integrating solar power and load forecasting, the trivial crisp problem formulations are modified by fuzzification. An evolutionary algorithm based on the concept and principle of quantum computation is applied to solve the UC problem. The conventional Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) is advanced by using several operators such as binary differential operator, mutation and crossover along with trivial rotation operator with a re-defined rotational angle look-up table. The QEA is further modified by introducing multi-population based scheme. The fitness function is formulated by combining the objective function, penalty function and the aggregated fuzzy membership function. The proposed FQEA is applied to UC problem in different scaled power systems up to 100 units. Provided simulation results will show the effectiveness of FQEA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007521.pdf","startPage":"2606","endPage":"2613","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy quantum computation based thermal unit commitment strategy with solar-battery system injection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spinning","Quantum computing","Production","Solar radiation","Quantum mechanics","Uncertainty","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","fuzzy set theory","load forecasting","power engineering computing","quantum computing","solar cells","solar power","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy quantum computation","solar-battery system injection","thermal unit commitment","solar battery system","fuzzy based quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm","FQEA","renewable power source","solar power","load forecasting","fuzzification","binary differential operator","rotational angle look-up table","multipopulation based scheme","fitness function","objective function","penalty function","fuzzy membership function","scaled power system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit Commitment","Fuzzy Logic","Quantum Computation","Evolutionary Method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy quantum computation based thermal unit commitment strategy with solar-battery system injection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12327840","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy quantum computation based thermal unit commitment strategy with solar-battery system injection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113617S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007531,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In most cases, as in data-driven fuzzy modeling, these fuzzy models reach a high performance from the point of view of accuracy, but from other points of view, such as complexity or interpretability, the models can present a poor performance. Several approaches are found in the specialized literature to reduce the complexity and improve the interpretability of the fuzzy models. Here, a post-processing approach is taken into account via the definition of the rules selection criterion that aims to choose the most relevant rules according to the well-known accuracy-interpretability trade-off. This criterion is based on Orthogonal Transformations, here the QRP transformation is taking into consideration, and its parameters are tuned genetically. The main objective is to check the true significance, drawbacks and advantages the firing matrix of the rules, that is the foundation of the most usual approaches based on orthogonal transformations for the complexity reduction of the fuzzy models. A neuro-fuzzy system, FasArt (Fuzzy Adaptive System ART based), and several case studies, data sets from the KEEL Project Repository, are used to tune and check this approach. This neuro-fuzzy system generates Mamdani fuzzy rule based systems (FRBSs), each with its own particularities and complexities from the point of view of fuzzy sets and rule generation. NSGA-II is the MOEA tool used to tune the criterion parameters based on accuracy-interpretability ideas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007531/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327850","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007531/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Checking orthogonal transformations and genetic algorithms for selection of fuzzy rules based on interpretability-accuracy concepts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Checking orthogonal transformations and genetic algorithms for selection of fuzzy rules based on interpretability-accuracy concepts","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08018S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007533,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277603600"},{"name":"Yu-Chuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37422227000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007533","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Biological cells","Interpolation","Training","Time series analysis","Learning systems","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","interpolation","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets","genetic algorithm","sparse fuzzy rule-based system","multiple fuzzy rule interpolation scheme","learning method","Mackey-Glass chaotic time series prediction problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy rule interpolation","sparse fuzzy rule-based systems","interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets","type-1 Gaussian fuzzy sets","genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007533","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new method for fuzzy rule interpolation with interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems based on genetic algorithms.

Here, GA is used in two stages simultaneously: the first stage involves selection and definition of fuzzy rules, while the second stage performs an optimal selection of membership function types associated to the fuzzy rules. It is argued that the performance of an FLC greatly depends on the fuzzy rules as well as the types of membership functions associated to the fuzzy sets. Thus, the aforementioned two-stage GA is a viable solution for designing an efficient FLC system. In order to evaluate performance, the proposed approach is applied to a well-known benchmarking controller design task, \"backing up a truck reversing system\". The simulation result exhibits superior performance and thereby validates the proposed integrated GA and FLC system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007560/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327879","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007560/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based fully automated and adaptive fuzzy logic controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based fully automated and adaptive fuzzy logic controller","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084383S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007565,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Pang Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Shih-Pang","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37593284900"},{"name":"Chun-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Applied Geoinformatics, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy & Science, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chun-Wei","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37557169900"},{"name":"Jui-Le Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jui-Le","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600079700"},{"name":"Ming-Chao Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Ming-Chao","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37591905200"},{"name":"Chu-Sing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chu-Sing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37335878400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007565","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Job shop scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis","Ant colony optimization","Benchmark testing","Simulation","Optimization","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["job shop scheduling","optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid solution construction strategy","ant colony optimization","ACO","transition operator","job shop scheduling problem","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ant colony optimization","job shop scheduling problem","transition operator"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel ant colony optimization (ACO) based on an efficient solution construction strategy (transition operator) for improving the quality of the end results of job shop scheduling problem (JSSP).

In the first category there are methods that first detect people and then count them; differently, the indirect methods face the counting problem by establishing a relation between some scene features and the estimated number of people. Some recent comparative evaluations carried out in the framework of the PETS initiative have demonstrated that the indirect methods tends to be more robust than direct ones, above all when they are used in very crowded conditions. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of an indirect approach that is based on a trainable estimator that does not require an explicit formulation of a priori knowledge about the perspective and density effects present in the scene at hand. In particular, we investigate on the way the counting accuracy in different crowding conditions is affected by the choice of the trainable estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007637/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12327508","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trainable estimators for indirect people counting: A comparative study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trainable estimators for indirect people counting: A comparative study","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066126S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007697,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The point of the maximum power lies at the knee of the I-V curve. Tracking this point is a very important issue concerning the energy yield of the PV systems. One of the efficient tracking techniques is based on the Fuzzy agents which are able of fine tuning the cell operating voltage and current to keep the maximum possible output power. In this paper, a fuzzy agent with two input parameters enhanced by the fractional open circuit voltage technique will be used to track the MPP in a fast and accurate manner that is better than the traditional techniques. Assigning different weights for the two inputs of the fuzzy agent adapts the power response to achieve fast settling and accurate tracking of the cell maximum output power even under extreme variable atmospheric conditions in an efficient manner with better performance than conventional fuzzy MPPT technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12327568","htmlLink":"/document/6007697/","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Maximum power point tracker for a PV cell using a fuzzy agent adapted by the fractional open circuit voltage technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum power point tracker for a PV cell using a fuzzy agent adapted by the fractional open circuit voltage technique","confLoc":"Taipei","sourcePdf":"F0551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06318S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007707,"authors":[{"name":"Chiung-Hon Leon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiung-Hon Leon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37310817000"},{"name":"Yi-Ching Liaw","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ching","lastName":"Liaw","id":"37269314400"},{"name":"Lindroos Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Nanhua University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lindroos","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37895725600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007707","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Investments","Indexes","Color","Pragmatics","Time series analysis","Genetic algorithms","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","investment","knowledge based systems","pattern classification","stock markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["investment decision making","fuzzy candlestick pattern identification","genetic algorithm","financial time series","candlestick chart","stock market","technical analysis model","fuzzy linguistic variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy candlestick pattern","time series","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007707","abstract":"This paper proposed an approach to extract fuzzy candlestick patterns from financial time series and select a set of patterns for investment decision making. The candlestick chart in stock market is a widely used technical analysis model. The investor observes the candlestick chart and makes investment decisions by identifying patterns in the chart. We use fuzzy linguistic variables to model candlestick chart and extract patterns from the chart. A Genetic algorithm based approach is used to select a set of extracted pattern as the background knowledge in the system for investment decision making. The advantage of the proposed approach is the investment knowledge is comprehensible, editable, and visible. The user can set different range of historical financial time series to extract and select different set of patterns. The experimental results shows that the investment decisions based on selected fuzzy patterns have better investment performance than using original non-fuzzy patterns.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007707","startPage":"2696","endPage":"2701","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007707.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investment decision making by using fuzzy candlestick pattern and genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007707/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investment decision making by using fuzzy candlestick pattern and genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007707/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327578","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investment decision making by using fuzzy candlestick pattern and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048501S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6007714,"authors":[{"name":"Shing-Tai Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shing-Tai","lastName":"Pan","id":"37528598600"},{"name":"Sheng-Fu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Fu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272837900"},{"name":"Tzung-Pei Hong","affiliation":["Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzung-Pei","lastName":"Hong","id":"37265747900"},{"name":"Jian-Hong Zeng","affiliation":["Computer Science and Information Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-Hong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37894747000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7315-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7316-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"6007714","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sleep","Hidden Markov models","Brain modeling","Electroencephalography","Speech recognition","Vector quantization","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","fuzzy set theory","hidden Markov models","medical signal processing","speech recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy vector quantization","observation-based discrete hidden Markov model","EEG signal recognition","electroencephalogram","speech recognition rate","Mandarin speech","fuzzy codebook","K means algorithm","Mandarin training speech","fuzzy set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy Vector Quantization","EEG signal","Discrete Hidden Markov Model"]}],"abstract":"This paper applies fuzzy vector quantization (FVQ) to the modeling of observation-based Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM) and then to improve the speech recognition rate for the Mandarin speech.

Then, based on the trained codebook, the speech features are quantized by the fuzzy sets defined on each vectors of the codebook. Subsequently, the quantized speech features are statistically applied to train the model of DHMM for the speech recognition.

In this paper, a general T2 FMF design method and its application to back propagation (BP) neural networks is proposed. The general T2 FMF is designed using data histograms and then type-1 fuzzy membership values which are extracted from the centroid of the T2 FMF are used as inputs to the BP neural network. Applying our proposed membership assignment to the BP neural networks shows improvement of the classification performance since the uncertainty of pattern data are desirably controlled by the T2 fuzzy memberships.

energy and time efficient. For a comprehensive understanding of the effects of process conditions, such as tool rotation speed and traverse speed, on characterisations of welded materials, it is essential to establish prediction models for different aspects of the materials' behaviours. Because of the high complexity of the FSW process, it is often difficult to derive accurate and yet transparent enough mathematical models. In such a situation, a systematic data-driven fuzzy modelling approach is developed and implemented in this paper to model FSW behaviour relating to AA5083 aluminium alloy, consisting of microstructural features, mechanical properties, as well as overall weld quality. This methodology allows constructing transparent fuzzy models considering both accuracy and interpretability attributes of fuzzy systems. The elicited models proved to be accurate, interpretable and robust and can be further applied to facilitate the optimal design of process parameters, with the aim of finding the optimal combinations of process parameters to achieve desired welding properties.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007731","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5976945/6007305/06007731.pdf","startPage":"2288","endPage":"2295","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple characterisation modelling of friction stir welding using a genetic multi-objective data-driven fuzzy modelling approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple characterisation modelling of friction stir welding using a genetic multi-objective data-driven fuzzy modelling approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12327602","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple characterisation modelling of friction stir welding using a genetic multi-objective data-driven fuzzy modelling approach","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097808S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007744,"authors":[{"name":"Jerene Jacob","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Texas, Tech University (TTU), Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jerene","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37896021800"},{"name":"Tam Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Texas, Tech University (TTU), Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37539291500"},{"name":"Donald Y.

Many investigators have reported the use of accelerometers for fall detection. In addition, the use of miniature gyroscopes has also been reported to be able to detect falls, but the effects of sensor placement on the back of a person have not been studied thoroughly. In this paper we present a simple solution for effective fall detection using both an accelerometer and two gyroscopes placed, as a single unit, on three different positions along the thoracic vertebrae (i.e., T-4, T-7, and T-10). Results indicated that T-10 was not a good location for the gyroscope placement for fall detection. However, both T-4 and T-7 were suitable, with the results for T-4 being slightly better. Using a simple rule-based multi-thresholds algorithm that utilizes the recorded resultant gravitational acceleration, angular change, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, we were able to successfully detect all 60 falls and differentiate between falls and activities of daily living (ADL) with no false positives on young volunteers. More testing data is needed, especially for backward falls, to test the robustness of our simple algorithm and to improve the sensor portability for future trial studies on geriatric populations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007744/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12327615","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6007744/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fall detection study on the sensors placement location and a rule-based multi-thresholds algorithm using both accelerometer and gyroscopes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fall detection study on the sensors placement location and a rule-based multi-thresholds algorithm using both accelerometer and gyroscopes","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"F0613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057147S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5976945","isNumber":"6007305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5976945","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6007305","articleId":"6007744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6007791,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Landauer","affiliation":["AeroSpace Integration Science Center, Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Landauer","id":"37331158600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0713-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0712-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6007791","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007791","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Analytical models","Government","Software","Mathematical model","XML","Psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["good theory","Kurt Lewin","psychology","space system development","requirement specification","contract management","system design","bus flight software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space System Development","New Mathematical Methods","Enabling Technologies","System Development and Operation","Algorithms","Methods and Tools"]}],"abstract":"The title is a quote from the psychologist Kurt Lewin, who was pointing out that psychology was thin on good theories, but benefited greatly when there was one.

Our intent is a reach back from application difficulties to possibly applicable theories, and a description of what those theories can imply for us. The application difficulties occur throughout the development lifecycle, in acquisition preparation, requirement specification, contract management, system design and development, and bus flight software (we do not intend to imply that these are the only areas with difficulties, or the only ones that need new theories; they are merely indicative of the widespread problem). We describe these difficult areas as we have seen them, describe the applicable theories (proposing new ones when necessary), and describe how the theory will change the practice of space system development.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC-IT.2011.32","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/6007755/6007756/06007791.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"191","doi":"10.1109/SMC-IT.2011.32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"There is Nothing so Practical as a Good Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"There is Nothing so Practical as a Good Theory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6007791/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12218537","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"There is Nothing so Practical as a Good Theory","confLoc":"Palo Alto, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4446a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070242S","chronDate":"2-4 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6007755","isNumber":"6007756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6007755","xplore-issue":"6007756","articleId":"6007791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6007807,"authors":[{"name":"Yufeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenyang Aerospace University, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37676362400"},{"name":"Yanan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenyang Aerospace University, China"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37899199000"},{"name":"Haijuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenyang Aerospace University, China"],"firstName":"Haijuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37900188700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9984-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9985-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6007807","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","primary signal detection","Rayleigh fading channel","primary user","double threshold detection","cognitive users","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio(CR)","Rayleigh fading channel","energy detection","double threshold detection","double threshold detection with channel selective"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary signal detection over Rayleigh fading channel for cognitive radio","doi":"10.1109/URKE.2011.6007807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007793","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Uncertainty Reasoning and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Uncertainty Reasoning and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993769/6007793/06007807.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URKE.2011.6007807","startPage":"239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007807","abstract":"This paper studies the primary user (PU) signal detection methods over Rayleigh fading channel in cognitive radio system.

In this method, cognitive user receives signals by selecting the maximum SNR channel, so it can effectively detect the primary user (PU) signal in Rayleigh fading environment. And the influence on detection performance is also analyzed when the distance changes between the primary user and cognitive users. Simulation results show that, when the false alarm probability is constant, the detection probability is larger and misdetection probability is smaller as the distance increases between primary user and cognitive user.

Not only in distance learning, but also in face to face and blended learning, m-learning can provide supports. However, with the increasing number of users, services, education contents and resources, ways of deploying m-learning are difficult to deal with some problems. This paper particularly focuses on three aspects of the troubles of m-learning, limited resources of the mobile devices, storage capacity of massive didactical materials and expensive investment of hardware and software. Then in order to solve them, cloud computing is to be introduced in. Cloud computing, whose distinct features are very appropriate for us to overcome the problems in m-learning, provides reliable, customized and QoS guaranteed dynamic computing environments for end-users. And then other advantages will be analyzed when the cloud technologies are used in m-learning. So the conclusion is cloud computing will be of great significance to the improvement of m-learning.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Uncertainty Reasoning and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993769/6007866/06007934.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Uncertainty Reasoning and Knowledge Engineering","doi":"10.1109/URKE.2011.6007934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URKE.2011.6007934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing promotes the progress of m-learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Hardware","Educational institutions","Electronic learning","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer aided instruction","distance learning","educational institutions","mobile computing","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","m-learning","mobile learning","V-learning","virtualized learning","Beijing Normal University","distance learning","blended learning","mobile devices","QoS","dynamic computing environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["V-learning","M-learning","cloud computing","virtualization","web hosting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6007934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing promotes the progress of m-learning","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6007934/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12218056","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing promotes the progress of m-learning","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"162164322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038465S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993769","isNumber":"6007866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993769","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6007866","articleId":"6007934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6007987,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefeng Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institute, Qionghai, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Qin","id":"37890065200"},{"name":"Baoru Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hainan Software Profession Institute, Qionghai, China"],"firstName":"Baoru","lastName":"Han","id":"37404890800"},{"name":"Lei Cui","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qin Huang-dao, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37894993000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9600-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9599-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9598-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6007987","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6007987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Adaptive systems","Fault diagnosis","Circuit faults","Training","Analog circuits","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","electronic engineering computing","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","principal component analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fuzzy neural network tolerance","analog circuit fault diagnosis method","fuzzy theory","wavelet transform","principal element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Principal Component Analysis","Wavelet Transform","Integrated adaptive fuzzy neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCIENG.2011.6007987","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997697/6007941/06007987.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Computing, Control and Industrial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Computing, Control and Industrial Engineering","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6007941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIENG.2011.6007987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A kind integrated adaptive fuzzy neural network tolerance analog circuit fault diagnosis method","abstract":"Combining fuzzy theory and neural network is an effective way to be applied in fault diagnosis of analog circuit.

Both matched filter and dechirp processing can realize pulse compression of LFM, and then get high resolution target range profile. Matched filter has strong anti-noise ability; it can also achieve accurate pulse compression under seriously noisy environment. Dechirp processing can reduce the sample rate of AD efficiently, but the anti-noise ability is not as good as matched filter. This paper analyzes the algorithms of matched filter and dechirp processing which are used in LFM, then simulates the pulse compression to get high resolution target one-dimension range profile under different signal to noise ratio (SNR). The simulation results indicate that matched filter has strong anti-noise ability, dechirp processing has advantage in sample rate of data processing by hardware.

In this paper, by comparison with PSO algorithm, QPSO algorithm have obvious advantages. The simulation is carried out under different altitudes and velocities. The result shows that thrust can be increased by 7% ~ 9% under maximum thrust mode and improved by 0.3% ~ 3.7% than that is optimized by Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

This approach gives a new global sliding mode manifold for the second-order robot manipulators, which enable system trajectory to run on the sliding mode manifold at the start point and eliminate the reaching phase of the conventional sliding mode control. Robustness for system dynamics is guaranteed over all the response time. Self-organized fuzzy neural networks (SOFNN) are employed to eliminate chattering of global sliding mode control, and enforce the sliding mode motion by SOFNN learning the upper bound of model errors and uncertain disturbances.

The simulation experiment based on the cashmere and wool from various regions indicate that the Elman neural network based on improved niche adaptive genetic algorithm make a good match for the near infrared spectrum of cashmere and wool, and it has better dynamic performance, quicker approach speed, better precision and generalization ability.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIP.2011.6008332","startPage":"660","endPage":"664","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993748/6008309/06008332.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2011.6008332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Elman neural network based on improved niche adaptive genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Wool","Heuristic algorithms","Convergence","Spectroscopy","Genetics","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","feedback","genetic algorithms","infrared spectroscopy","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Elman neural network","niche adaptive genetic algorithm","selffeedback gain coefficient","near infrared spectrum","mathematics model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of Elman neural network based on improved niche adaptive genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6008332/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217819","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Elman neural network based on improved niche adaptive genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"TAP110277finalP.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046241S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993748","isNumber":"6008309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993748","xplore-issue":"6008309","articleId":"6008332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6008340,"authors":[{"name":"Fen Zhang","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Xi''an Yang Normal University, Xianyang, China"],"firstName":"Fen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37899563000"},{"name":"Yanbang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yanbang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37899179100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0816-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0813-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0815-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6008340","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008340","abstract":"The problem of delay-dependent asymptotic stability for neural networks with time-varying delays is investigated.

When combined with space time coding it provides the advantages of space-time coding and OFDM, resulting in a spectrally efficient wideband communication system. However, MIMO-OFDM systems suffer with the problem of inherent high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) due to the intersymbol interference between the subcarriers. In this paper, a generalized framework for PAPR reduction for space-time coded OFDM systems based on modified PTS using forward error-correcting codes (FECs) such as Turbo codes and Golay codes are employed in the modified PTS radix FFT, where, the PAPR is jointly optimized in both the real and imaginary parts, separately multiplied with phase factors when dividing the subcarriers into 4 subgroups. The simulation results show that the combined FEC with modified PTS technique significantly provides better PAPR reduction with reduced computational complexity compared to original PTS technique in the MIMO-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/SHUSER.2011.6008507","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Humanities, Science and Engineering Research","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996360/6008470/06008507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SHUSER.2011.6008507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008470","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified PTS with FECs for PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM system with different subcarriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008507","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified PTS with FECs for PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM system with different subcarriers","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008507/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12218237","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008507/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified PTS with FECs for PAPR reduction in MIMO-OFDM system with different subcarriers","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p89dananjayan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06527S","chronDate":"6-7 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996360","isNumber":"6008470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996360","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6008470","articleId":"6008507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-31"},{"_id":6008509,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6069922/6008509/6008509-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Lu (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2007.

This paper explicitly highlights several subtle but essential design differences that distinguish energy harvesting systems from battery-powered embedded systems. Moreover, we envision the necessity and importance of developing a simulation tool that enables design space exploration and quick performance evaluation at the early design phase. The practical issues, challenges and considerations for implementation of this envisaged simulation tool is discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2162161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2162161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6069922/06008509.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Design of Micro-Scale Energy Harvesting Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Design of Micro-Scale Energy Harvesting Systems","volume":"1","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008509/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12331851","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Design of Micro-Scale Energy Harvesting Systems","sourcePdf":"jetcas-lu-2162161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198118S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"6008509","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6008511,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichiro Ishii","affiliation":["Renesas Electronics Corporation, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6056707/6008511/6008511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuichiro Ishii was born in Hyogo, Japan, in October, 1972.

As standard SRAM bitcells are limited to operation in the strong-inversion regimes due to process variations and local mismatch, the development of specially designed SRAMs for low voltage operation has become popular in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel 9T bitcell, implementing a Supply Feedback concept to internally weaken the pull-up current during write cycles and thus enable low-voltage write operations. As opposed to the majority of existing solutions, this is achieved without the need for additional peripheral circuits and techniques. The proposed bitcell is fully functional under global and local variations at voltages from 250 mV to 1.1 V. In addition, the proposed cell presents a low-leakage state reducing power up to 60%, as compared to an identically supplied 8T bitcell. An 8 kbit SF-SRAM array was implemented and fabricated in a low-power 40 nm process, showing full functionality and ultra-low power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"46","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12308571","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008514/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 250 mV 8 kb 40 nm Ultra-Low Power 9T Supply Feedback SRAM (SF-SRAM)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 250 mV 8 kb 40 nm Ultra-Low Power 9T Supply Feedback SRAM (SF-SRAM)","sourcePdf":"jssc-teman-2164009-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110583S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6056707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6056707","articleId":"6008514","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6008517,"authors":[{"name":"Axel Tessmann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6031177/6008517/6008517-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Axel Tessmann received the Dipl.-Ing. degree from the University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2006, both in electrical engineering.","In 1997, he joined the High Frequency Devices and Circuits Department, Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF), Freiburg, Germany, where he is involved in the development of monolithically integrated circuits and subsystems for high-resolution imaging systems.

Developing maintenance strategies is one of the effective ways to achieve these profitable goals. The reliability-centered maintenance approach is a key method in providing optimal maintenance strategies. It considers the tradeoffs between the upfront maintenance costs and the potential costs of reliability losses. Since a transmission system is a group of different kinds of equipment and the reliability of the electric facilities varies with time, an equipment state model using a modified semi-Markov chain is proposed. In addition, a genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal maintenance strategies from a large class of possible maintenance scenarios. These optimal maintenance strategies have been tested on an IEEE 9-bus system and an IEEE 118-bus system; the results show that the proposed method minimizes the total expected costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12288240","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6008525/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Reliability-Centered Approach to an Optimal Maintenance Strategy in Transmission Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliability-Centered Approach to an Optimal Maintenance Strategy in Transmission Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-kim-2162752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096229S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6029804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6029804","articleId":"6008525","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6008528,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Clarke","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Clarke","id":"37283716900"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, University of York, York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6008528","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":773},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We propose a joint discrete stochastic optimization based transmit diversity selection (TDS) and relay selection (RS) algorithm for decode-and-forward (DF), cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a non-negligible direct path.

A key aspect of these radios is the `cognition' gained through a spectrum scanning process. The benefit of this cognition is apparent and well studied in terms of achieving better communication performance on selected spectrum. The benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption, however, due to easier channel access and less contention have not been quantified in prior work. On the other hand, spectrum scanning to gain cognition is a power-intensive process and the costs incurred in terms of energy lost need to be accounted for. Thus, it is not clear whether a cognitive radio would be more energy efficient than a conventional radio, and if so, under what circumstances. This focus on energy consumption is particularly important when considering portable communication devices that are energy constrained. This work takes a first step in this direction by exploring whether a cognitive radio can save energy over a conventional radio in the Ad Hoc Wireless LAN scenario. The interplay between different important parameters involved is analyzed and their impact on energy consumption is studied.","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008546","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996362/6008545/06008546.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008546","publicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the energy efficiency of cognitive radios - A study of the Ad Hoc Wireless LAN scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the energy efficiency of cognitive radios - A study of the Ad Hoc Wireless LAN scenario","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008546/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008546/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12218239","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the energy efficiency of cognitive radios - A study of the Ad Hoc Wireless LAN scenario","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"10IEEEBad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069766S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996362","isNumber":"6008545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996362","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6008545","articleId":"6008546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008569,"authors":[{"name":"Rishiraj A.

As the need for high-density memory increases, DRAM has proven to be less attractive from the point of view of scaling and energy consumption. PCM-only memories suffer from latency issues, high write energy, and the problem of limited write endurance. Research in this domain has focused mainly on using various hybrid memory configurations to address these shortcomings. A commodity DRAM module as a cache for PCM memory has emerged as a potential solution. But this method requires use of a separate memory controller and is unable to achieve better performance than a DRAM-only based memory at low energy. We propose a PCM based main memory system design using a small, embedded DRAM (eDRAM) cache to replace the row buffers in the PCM memory chip. This reduces the high latencies of PCM and the energy consumption of the main memory system. Our methodology also eliminates the need for separate memory controllers. Through simulation results, we show competitive performance by reducing average memory access time of a slow PCM based memory and significant energy reductions against a DDR3 commodity DRAM memory system of similar storage size. Our proposed system is highly energy efficient and provides 35.02%improvement in EDP over a DRAM-only system. Our system consumes less energy than the state-of-the-art PCM hybrid system using a commodity DRAM cache.","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008569","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996362/6008545/06008569.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient Phase Change Memory based main memory for future high performance systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008569/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient Phase Change Memory based main memory for future high performance systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12218260","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008569/","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient Phase Change Memory based main memory for future high performance systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2IEEEBhe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085143S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996362","isNumber":"6008545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996362","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6008545","articleId":"6008569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6008579,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Meng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Meng","id":"37903510700"},{"name":"Daniel Rossell","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rossell","id":"37888108300"},{"name":"Ayse K.

Utilizing this framework, we quantify the performance improvement as well as the power and thermal profiles of parallel workloads running on a 16-core 3D system with on-chip DRAM. The 3D system improves application performance by 72.6% on average in comparison to an equivalent 2D chip with off-chip memory. Power consumption per core increases by up to 32.7%. The increase in peak chip temperature, however, is limited to 1.5\u00b0C as the lower power DRAM layers share the heat of the hotter cores.

Several methods, mainly focusing on the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) or the Flash Buffer Management have been proposed to address these problems. In this paper, we propose an idea of reducing write traffic to Flash by the following steps: First we avoid repeated writes to Flash SSD by finding the redundant writes using a cryptographic HASH cipher. We design a set of acceleration techniques to reduce the latency overhead of this extra computational cost. Then we propose a PCM-based buffer extender for Flash SSD where we write the frequent updates to hot pages of Flash into PCM layer, which allows in-page update. Finally, while merging the PCM updated data to the Flash page, we use a special merging technique to change the flushes into sequential flushes, as sequential writes on Flash are almost thrice as fast as random writes. We maintain the redundant write finder mechanism in PCM. We test our design using a trace-driven simulator. The results show that compared to the traditional design technique, lifetime of Flash SSD can be more than quadrupled, while consuming 20% less power to do so with some improvement in write performance as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and endurance aware Flash-PCM memory system","doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008592","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008545","publicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996362/6008545/06008592.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power and endurance aware Flash-PCM memory system","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008592/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12218283","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and endurance aware Flash-PCM memory system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"50WIPGCSur.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063485S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996362","isNumber":"6008545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996362","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6008545","articleId":"6008592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008600,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Natarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37391339300"},{"name":"Sangmin Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sangmin","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37576975000"},{"name":"David J.

Different applications require widely different values for the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (E.I.R.P). These values range from as low as -20 dBm for Body Area Networks (BAN) to as high as 30 dBm for cellular communications. This paper overviews several approaches to achieve highly efficient wireless power transmission. A Class-C amplifier operates in the 400 MHz MedRadio band and achieves measured peak output power and drain efficiency values of -4 dBm and 43%, respectively. A switched-capacitor PA achieves an average output power of 17.7 dBm, an average PAE of 27%, and an EVM of 2.6% operating with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation at a center frequency of 2.25 GHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Switches","Capacitors","OFDM","Power harmonic filters","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","frequency division multiplexing","power amplifiers","power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greener wireless transmission","power amplifier design","highly efficient wireless power transmission","class-C amplifier","switched-capacitor PA","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing modulation","frequency 400 MHz to 2.25 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class C","Switched Capacitor","power amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008600","publicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996362/6008545/06008600.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards greener wireless transmission: Efficient power amplifier design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards greener wireless transmission: Efficient power amplifier design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008600/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008600/","accessionNumber":"12218291","conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards greener wireless transmission: Efficient power amplifier design","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"58SoCAll.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0359S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996362","isNumber":"6008545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996362","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6008545","articleId":"6008600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6008617,"authors":[{"name":"Rushi Vyas","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6011598/6008617/6008617-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rushi Vyas (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2005 and 2010, respectively, with a background in microwave and wireless circuit design, power electronics and embedded systems.

Field Modeling and Incident/Scattered Field Calibration Techniques in Microwave Tomography","abstract":"Imaging with microwave tomography systems requires both the incident field within the imaging domain as well as calibration factors that convert the collected data to corresponding data in the numerical model used for inversion. The numerical model makes various simplifying assumptions, e.g., 2-D versus 3-D wave propagation, which the calibration coefficients are meant to take into account. For an air-based microwave tomography system, we study two types of calibration techniques-incident and scattered field calibration-combined with two different incident field models: a 2-D line-source and an incident field from full-wave 3-D simulation of the tomography system. Although the 2-D line-source approximation does not accurately model incident field in our system, the use of scattered field calibration with the 2-D line-source provides similar or better images to incident and scattered field calibration with an accurate incident field. Thus, if scattered field calibration is used, a simple (but inaccurate) incident field is acceptable for our microwave tomography system. While not strictly generalizable, we expect our methodology to be applicable to most other microwave tomography systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12238823","volume":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6008622/","publicationDate":"2011","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Incident Field Modeling and Incident/Scattered Field Calibration Techniques in Microwave Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Incident Field Modeling and Incident/Scattered Field Calibration Techniques in Microwave Tomography","sourcePdf":"lawp-ostadrahimi-2166849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095195S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"6008622","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6008623,"authors":[{"name":"Yazi Cao","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Institute of Microelectronics and Information Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yazi","lastName":"Cao","id":"37693479600"},{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Institute of Microelectronics and Information Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37650865900"},{"name":"Gaofeng Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Institute of Microelectronics and Information Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37069947100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6008623","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2417},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Antenna measurements","Mobile antennas","Wireless LAN","Mobile handsets","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","microstrip antennas","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","slot antennas","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact multiband open-ended slot antenna","mobile handsets","printed open-ended slots","E-shaped slot","T-shaped slot","GSM900","DCS1800","PCS1900","UMTS","WLAN bands","antenna design","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiband antenna","printed slot antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008623","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2166990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","abstract":"A novel compact multiband antenna formed by two printed open-ended slots, with the first one a T-shaped slot and the second one an E-shaped slot, cut at the edge of the ground plane of mobile handsets is presented.

Existing beamformers can be divided into those that preserve or distort the desired signal. Beamformers that preserve the desired signal are, for example, the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer that is supposed, ideally, to reject the undesired signal and reduce the ambient noise power, and the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer that reduces the interference-plus-noise power. The multichannel Wiener filter, on the other hand, reduces the interference-plus-noise power without preserving the desired signal. In this paper, a speech distortion and interference rejection constraint (SDIRC) beamformer is derived that minimizes the ambient noise power subject to specific constraints that allow a tradeoff between speech distortion and interference-plus-noise reduction on the one hand, and undesired signal and ambient noise reductions on the other hand. Closed-form expressions for the performance measures of the SDIRC beamformer are derived and the relations to the aforementioned beamformers are derived. The performance evaluation demonstrates the tradeoffs that can be made using the SDIRC beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12470258","htmlLink":"/document/6008628/","displayDocTitle":"A Speech Distortion and Interference Rejection Constraint Beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Speech Distortion and Interference Rejection Constraint Beamformer","sourcePdf":"tasl-habets-2166958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080909S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6008628","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6008635,"authors":[{"name":"Pasquale Sellitto","affiliation":["Laboratoire Interuniversitaire des Syst\u00e8mes Atmosph\u00e9riques, UMR 7583, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est and Universit\u00e9 Denis Diderot-Paris 7, Creteil, France","Earth Observation Laboratory, Department of Computer, Systems and Industrial Engineering, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6155684/6008635/6008635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pasquale Sellitto received the Laurea degree in physics from La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in geoinformation from Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy, in 2009.","Since 2010, he is Research Associate at Laboratoire Inter-universitaire des Syst\u00e8mes Atmosph\u00e9riques, Cr\u00e9teil, France.

However, retrieving tropospheric ozone concentration information from nadir satellite data is an arduous task, given the weak sensitivity of the earth's radiance to ozone variations in the lower part of the atmosphere. We propose a new methodology, based on neural networks (NN), for retrieving the tropospheric ozone column from SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) nadir UV/VIS measurements. The design of the NN algorithm is based on an analysis of the information content of measurements in both UV and VIS bands, carried out by a combined radiative transfer model and NN extended pruning procedure.

It is based on a statistical method called partial least squares (PLS) and on the inverse dynamic model of a robot. PLS is a well-established linear technique in process control for identifying and monitoring industrial plants. Since a robot inverse dynamics can be represented as a linear static model in the dynamical parameters, it is possible to use algorithms and confidence regions developed in statistical decision theory. This approach has several advantages with respect to standard FDI modules: It is strictly related to the algorithm used for identifying the dynamical parameters, it does not need to solve at run time a set of nonlinear differential equations, and the design of a nonlinear observer is not required. This method has been tested on a PUMA 560 simulator, and results of the simulations are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6175217","startPage":"3167","endPage":"3175","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6175217/06008637.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PLS-Based Statistical Approach for Fault Detection and Isolation of Robotic Manipulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Monitoring","Fault detection","Manipulators","Joints","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","fault diagnosis","least squares approximations","manipulator dynamics","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLS","fault detection and isolation","robotic manipulators","statistical method","partial least squares","robot inverse dynamic model","linear technique","process control","linear static model","dynamical parameters","statistical decision theory","PUMA 560 simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault detection and isolation (FDI)","Kalman estimation","monitoring","partial least squares (PLS)","robot manipulator","safety","statistical regression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A PLS-Based Statistical Approach for Fault Detection and Isolation of Robotic Manipulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6008637/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12638414","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PLS-Based Statistical Approach for Fault Detection and Isolation of Robotic Manipulators","sourcePdf":"tie-muradore-2167110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095081S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"6008637","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6008638,"authors":[{"name":"Rachid Errouissi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Sciences, University of Quebec, Chicoutimi, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6175217/6008638/6008638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rachid Errouissi received the B.Sc. degree in electronics from Faculty of Sciences and Technology of Mohammedia, Morocco, in 1998, the first M.Sc. degree in power electronics from \u00c9cole Mohammedia d'ing\u00e9nieurs, Rabat, Morocco, in 2001 and two other M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and in automation and system engineering from Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard, Lyon, France, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Quebec, Chicoutimi, QC, Canada, in 2010.","His research interests include robust nonlinear control, electric machines, and adjustable speed drives."]},"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Errouissi","id":"37395809800"},{"name":"Mohand Ouhrouche","affiliation":["Department of Applied Sciences, University of Quebec, Chicoutimi, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6175217/6008638/6008638-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Mohand Ouhrouche (M'99\u2013SM'10) received the Ing\u00e9niorat d'\u00e9tat degree with honors in electrical engineering from the University of B\u00e9jaia, B\u00e9jaia, Algeria, in 1988, the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 1992 and 1998, respectively.","From 1993 to 1995, he worked as an Assistant Researcher at \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al on integration of Non-Utility Generators into the Hydro-Quebec's distribution system.

Taylor series expansion is used to predict the system response over a finite horizon. As NPC cannot remove completely the steady-state error in the presence of mismatched parameters and external perturbation, a disturbance observer is used to estimate the offset caused by parametric uncertainties and the load torque variation. In addition, input constraints (restrictions on the magnitude) are considered in the synthesis of the disturbance observer, resulting in an equivalent cascaded proportional integral action with an antiwindup compensator. The validity of the proposed controller was tested via simulation and experiment. Excellent results were obtained with respect to the speed trajectory tracking, stability, and disturbance rejection.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167109","startPage":"3078","endPage":"3088","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6175217/06008638.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6175217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Cascaded Nonlinear Predictive Control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Antiwindup Compensator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Torque","Predictive control","Cost function","Robustness","Adaptive control","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade control","compensation","control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems","observers","permanent magnet motors","perturbation techniques","PI control","predictive control","robust control","synchronous motors","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","cascaded control","nonlinear predictive control","permanent magnet synchronous motor","antiwindup compensator","Taylor series expansion","finite horizon","NPC","perturbation technique","parametric uncertainty","load torque variation","disturbance observer synthesis","proportional integral controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antiwindup compensator","cascaded control","disturbance observer","nonlinear predictive control (NPC)","permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust Cascaded Nonlinear Predictive Control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Antiwindup Compensator","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6008638/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638415","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Cascaded Nonlinear Predictive Control of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Antiwindup Compensator","sourcePdf":"tie-ouhrouche-2167109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109034S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"6008638","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":6008642,"authors":[{"name":"Kristofor B.

The goal is to achieve good dehazed images and videos at the receiver while sustaining low bitrates (using compression) in the transmission pipeline. At first, this paper proposes a novel method for single-image dehazing, which is used for the investigation. It operates at a faster speed than current methods and can avoid halo effects by using the median operation. We then consider the dehazing effects in compression by investigating the coding artifacts and motion estimation in cases of applying any dehazing method before or after compression. We conclude that better dehazing performance with fewer artifacts and better coding efficiency is achieved when the dehazing is applied before compression. Simulations for Joint Photographers Expert Group images in addition to subjective and objective tests with H.264 compressed sequences validate our conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2166968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6129825/06008642.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2166968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Dehazing Effects on Image and Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008642/","displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Dehazing Effects on Image and Video Coding","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12472225","pubMedId":"21896391","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008642/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Dehazing Effects on Image and Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tip-gibson-2166968-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092985S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6129825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"6129825","articleId":"6008642","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6008643,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung Il Koo","affiliation":["Qualcomm Korea Research and Development Center, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6151934/6008643/6008643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyung Il Koo (S'09\u2013M'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002, 2004, and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Research Engineer with the Qualcomm Korea R&D Center, Seoul, where he is responsible for developing core technology in computer vision.

In the domain of face recognition, these properties allow the system to quickly deliver high recognition results to the end user. Motivated by the recent feature descriptor called Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes (POEM), which balances the three concerns, this paper aims at enhancing its performance with respect to all these criteria. To this end, we first optimize the parameters of POEM and then apply the whitened principal-component-analysis dimensionality reduction technique to get a more compact, robust, and discriminative descriptor. For face recognition, the efficiency of our algorithm is proved by strong results obtained on both constrained (Face Recognition Technology, FERET) and unconstrained (Labeled Faces in the Wild, LFW) data sets in addition with the low complexity. Impressively, our algorithm is about 30 times faster than those based on Gabor filters. Furthermore, by proposing an additional technique that makes our descriptor robust to rotation, we validate its efficiency for the task of image matching.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2166974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06008646.pdf","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2166974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes for Face Recognition and Image Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008646/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes for Face Recognition and Image Matching","volume":"21","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537599","pubMedId":"21896385","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008646/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes for Face Recognition and Image Matching","sourcePdf":"tip-vu-2166974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119841S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6008646","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6008648,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Compared with most previous methods that focus on sports and news videos, the summarization of personal videos is more challenging because of its unconstrained content and the lack of any pre-imposed video structures. We formulate video summarization as a novel dictionary selection problem using sparsity consistency, where a dictionary of key frames is selected such that the original video can be best reconstructed from this representative dictionary. An efficient global optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the dictionary selection model with the convergence rates as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(1/\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) (where \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n is the iteration counter), in contrast to traditional sub-gradient descent methods of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n(1/\u221a\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n).

For recently discussed 400-V dc distribution bus voltages, a buck-type PFC rectifier is a logical solution. In this paper, an efficiency-optimized, 98.8% efficient, 5-kW three-phase buck-type PFC rectifier with 400-V output is presented. Methods for calculating losses of all components are described and are used to optimize the converter design for efficiency at full load. Special attention is paid to semiconductor losses, which are shown to be dominant, with the parasitic device capacitance losses being a significant component. The calculation of these parasitic capacitance losses is treated in detail, and the charge-balance approach used is verified. A prototype of the proposed rectifier is constructed which verifies the accuracy of the models used for loss calculation and optimization.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06008661.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a 99% Efficient Three-Phase Buck-Type PFC Rectifier for 400-V DC Distribution Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2166406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2166406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Towards a 99% Efficient Three-Phase Buck-Type PFC Rectifier for 400-V DC Distribution Systems","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543547","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6008661/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a 99% Efficient Three-Phase Buck-Type PFC Rectifier for 400-V DC Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-stupar-2166406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102026S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6008661","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6008662,"authors":[{"name":"Ruchira Withanage","affiliation":["Alstom Grid U.K. Limited, Stafford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6008662/6008662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruchira Withanage received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Katubedda, Sri Lanka and Staffordshire University, Stafford, U.K., in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","Since 2006, he has been with Alstom Grid U.K. Ltd.

The primary objectives of this paper are to discuss existing voltage-balancing techniques, to present a novel hybrid voltage-balancing technique, and to optimize the number of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in a series string in terms of power losses. The novel voltage-balancing technique can achieve good voltage balancing with a minimum number of components and minimum total losses (i.e., IGBT losses and balancing circuit losses). This technique was validated by both simulation and experimental work. The power loss of a high-voltage switch depends on the voltage-balancing circuit and the number of IGBTs in series and switching frequency. For a given application, the optimum number of IGBTs, in terms of power losses, depends on device characteristics and switching frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2167000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06008662.pdf","startPage":"2204","endPage":"2212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2167000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Series Connection of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008662/","displayDocTitle":"Series Connection of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","volume":"27","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008662/","publicationDate":"April 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12556196","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Series Connection of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs)","sourcePdf":"tpel-withanage-2167000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071504S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6008662","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6008666,"authors":[{"name":"Jingjing Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537685400"},{"name":"Michael G.

In the training phase, the fixed training power of the secondary user is selected such that the prescribed average spectral efficiency of the primary link is guaranteed. In the data transmission phase, the transmit power and the AMC mode of the secondary user are selected under the maximum packet error rate (PER) constraint of the primary user, as well as the average power and PER constraints of the secondary user. According to different kinds of primary-link information available to the secondary user, i.e., the transmission mode, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and no information at all, three optimization problems that maximize the average spectral efficiency of the secondary user are formulated, respectively. Based on their optimal solutions, three AMC-based adaptive transmission strategies that are composed of both online and offline algorithms are proposed. Their performances are then evaluated by extensive simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2166982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","startPage":"3805","endPage":"3813","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/06008676.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Transmission Strategies Exploiting the Primary-Link Adaptivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008676/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Transmission Strategies Exploiting the Primary-Link Adaptivity","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291125","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Transmission Strategies Exploiting the Primary-Link Adaptivity","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2166982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073492S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"6008676","onlineDate":"01 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6008690,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Idziorek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Idziorek","id":"37887919200"},{"name":"Mark Tannian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Tannian","id":"37887918300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008690","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":944},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Computer crime","Analytical models","Web servers","Web pages","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exploiting cloud utility models","cloud computing","Internet accessible cloud services","fraudulent resource consumption","public cloud service customers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","utility compute model","fraudulent resource consumption attack","application-layer DDoS","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses an attack on the cloud computing model by which an attacker subtly exploits a fundamental vulnerability of current utility compute models over a sustained period of time.

However, many management operations for virtual machines (VMs) including live migrations can be evoked by many cloud users at anytime. The outburst of executions of live migration operations can deteriorate migration performance and make it difficult to provide required resources to users in a timely manner. Therefore, understanding the behaviors and the performance of simultaneous live migrations is very important to provide efficient and reliable cloud computing services. In this paper, we construct a performance model of concurrent live migrations in virtualized datacenters. We first collect performance data from an experimental virtualized system in which we execute simultaneous live migrations. Based on the data, we next construct a performance model representing the performance characteristics of live migration using PRISM, a probabilistic model checker. We then demonstrate that we can easily verify the properties described in PRISM language regarding live migration performance using this model.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.48","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008692.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Modeling of Concurrent Live Migration Operations in Cloud Computing Systems Using PRISM Probabilistic Model Checker","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008692/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Modeling of Concurrent Live Migration Operations in Cloud Computing Systems Using PRISM Probabilistic Model Checker","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008692/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217305","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Modeling of Concurrent Live Migration Operations in Cloud Computing Systems Using PRISM Probabilistic Model Checker","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057365S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008708,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37402235800"},{"name":"Yun Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38546678200"},{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406542800"},{"name":"Jinjun Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280682600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008708","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"abstract":"Massive computation power and storage capacity of cloud computing systems allow scientists to deploy computation and data intensive applications without infrastructure investment, where large application datasets can be stored in the cloud. However, due to the pay-as-you-go model, the datasets should be strategically stored in order to reduce the overall application cost. In this paper, by utilising Data Dependency Graph (DDG) from data provenances in scientific applications, deleted datasets can be regenerated, and as such we develop a novel cost-effective datasets storage strategy that can automatically store appropriate datasets in the cloud. This strategy achieves a localised optimal trade-off between computation and storage, meanwhile also taking users' tolerance of data accessing delay into consideration. Simulations conducted on general (random) datasets and a specific astrophysics pulsar searching application with Amazon's cost model show that our strategy can reduce the application cost significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud

demand for a Video-on-demand (VoD) service varies with time in one-day period, provisioning self-owned servers for the peak load it must sustain a few hours per day leads to bandwidth underutilization at other times. Content clouds, e.g. Amazon Cloud Front and Azure CDN, let VoD providers pay by bytes for bandwidth resources, potentially leading to cost savings even if the unit rate to rent a machine from a cloud provider is higher than the rate to own one. In this paper, based on long-term traces from two large-scale VoD systems and temporal development model of content clouds, we tackle challenges, design and potential benefits in migrating VoD services into the hybrid cloud-assisted deployment, where the user requests are partly served by the self-owned servers and partly served by the cloud. Our measurements show that the popularity of the most popular videos decays so quickly, for example, by 11% after one hour that it poses large challenges on updating videos in the cloud. However, the trace-driven evaluations show that our proposed migration strategies (active, reactive and smart strategies), although simply based on the current information, can make the hybrid cloud-assisted VoD deployment save up to 30% bandwidth expense compared with the Clients/Server mode. They can also handle unpredicted the flash crowd traffic with little cost. It also shows that the cloud price and server bandwidth chosen play the most important roles in saving cost, while the cloud storage size and cloud content update strategy play the key roles in the user experience improvement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217324","htmlLink":"/document/6008711/","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Partial Migration of VoD Services to Content Clouds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Partial Migration of VoD Services to Content Clouds","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043638S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6008719,"authors":[{"name":"Kejiang Ye","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kejiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37528708800"},{"name":"Xiaohong Jiang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37277315100"},{"name":"Dawei Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37653053800"},{"name":"Jianhai Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianhai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539199300"},{"name":"Bei Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899799700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008719","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3038},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machining","Cloud computing","Servers","Memory management","Measurement","Monitoring","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple virtual machines","live migration","resource reservation","cloud computing environments","virtualization technology","server consolidation","resource isolation","load balancing","energy saving","cloud data center","workload aware migration strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual machine","live migration","resource reservation","performance"]}],"abstract":"Virtualization technology is currently becoming increasingly popular and valuable in cloud computing environments due to the benefits of server consolidation, live migration, and resource isolation. Live migration of virtual machines can be used to implement energy saving and load balancing in cloud data center. However, to our knowledge, most of the previous work concentrated on the implementation of migration technology itself while didn't consider the impact of resource reservation strategy on migration efficiency. This paper focuses on the live migration strategy of multiple virtual machines with different resource reservation methods. We first describe the live migration framework of multiple virtual machines with resource reservation technology. Then we perform a series of experiments to investigate the impacts of different resource reservation methods on the performance of live migration in both source machine and target machine. Additionally, we analyze the efficiency of parallel migration strategy and workload-aware migration strategy. The metrics such as downtime, total migration time, and workload performance overheads are measured. Experiments reveal some new discovery of live migration of multiple virtual machines. Based on the observed results, we present corresponding optimization methods to improve the migration efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.69","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008719.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Live Migration of Multiple Virtual Machines with Resource Reservation in Cloud Computing Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008719/","displayDocTitle":"Live Migration of Multiple Virtual Machines with Resource Reservation in Cloud Computing Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217332","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008719/","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live Migration of Multiple Virtual Machines with Resource Reservation in Cloud Computing Environments","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096353S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008720,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Mishra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37890164900"},{"name":"Anirudha Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Anirudha","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37298471300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008720","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Resource management","Servers","Shape","Estimation","Load management","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","resource allocation","vectors","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine placement","load balancing","server consolidation","data center environment","vector arithmetic","resource management","mathematical model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VM Placement","VM Load Balancing","VM consolidation","Vector Based VM Placement"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present the methodologies used in existing literature for Virtual Machine (VM) placement, load balancing and server consolidation in a data center environment.

We believe that with a strong mathematical base, our methodology has the potential to become the foundation of future models and algorithms in this research area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Theory of VM Placement: Anomalies in Existing Methodologies and Their Mitigation Using a Novel Vector Based Approach","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.38","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008720.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"On Theory of VM Placement: Anomalies in Existing Methodologies and Their Mitigation Using a Novel Vector Based Approach","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008720/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Theory of VM Placement: Anomalies in Existing Methodologies and Their Mitigation Using a Novel Vector Based Approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05373S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008723,"authors":[{"name":"Yongzhi Wang","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yongzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37900902500"},{"name":"Jinpeng Wei","affiliation":["Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jinpeng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37857055100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008723","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":435},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["History","Accuracy","Cloud computing","Analytical models","Computational modeling","System analysis and design","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data integrity","program verification","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["verification based integrity assurance framework","cloud computing","open distributed computing frameworks","task replication","collusive mappers","trusted verifier","Hadoop","open source MapReduce implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","Result Verification","Collusion detection","Hadoop"]}],"abstract":"MapReduce, a cloud computing paradigm, is gaining popularity. However, like all open distributed computing frameworks, MapReduce suffers from the integrity assurance vulnerability: it takes merely one malicious worker to render the overall computation result useless. Existing solutions are effective in defeating the malicious behavior of non-collusive workers, but are futile in detecting collusive workers. In this paper, we focus on the mappers, which typically constitute the majority of workers, and propose the Verification-based Integrity Assurance Framework (VIAF) to detect both non-collusive and collusive mappers. The basic idea of VIAF is to combine task replication with non-deterministic verification, in which consistent but malicious results from collusive mappers can be detected by a trusted verifier. We have implemented VIAF in Hadoop, an open source MapReduce implementation. Our theoretical analysis and experimental result show that VIAF can achieve high task accuracy while imposing acceptable overhead.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.33","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008723.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VIAF: Verification-Based Integrity Assurance Framework for MapReduce","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008723/","displayDocTitle":"VIAF: Verification-Based Integrity Assurance Framework for MapReduce","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008723/","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VIAF: Verification-Based Integrity Assurance Framework for MapReduce","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058284S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008725,"authors":[{"name":"Prasad Saripalli","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Saripalli","id":"37546610700"},{"name":"Gopal Pingali","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Gopal","lastName":"Pingali","id":"38179762100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008725","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Security","Delta modulation","Decision making","Taxonomy","Usability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision making","fuzzy set theory","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MADMAC","multiple attribute decision methodology","cloud adoption","multiattribute decision making","MADM","decision areas","DA","cloud switch","cloud type","vendor choice","decision matrix","server centric clouds","client centric clouds","mobile centric clouds","wide band Delphi method","simple additive weighting","SAW","iterative convergence","fuzzy TOPSIS methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Adoption","Decision Support Systems","Cloud ROI","Cloud Taxonomy","Delphi Method","Multi-attribute Decision Making"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Adoption decisions tend to involve multiple, conflicting criteria (attributes) with incommensurable units of measurements, which must be compared among multiple alternatives using imprecise and incomplete available information. Multi-attribute Decision Making (MADM) has been shown to provide a rational basis to aid decision making in such scenarios. We present a MADMAC framework for cloud adoption, consisting of 3 Decision Areas (DA) referred to as the Cloud Switch, Cloud Type and Vendor Choice. It requires the definition of Attributes, Alternatives and Attribute Weights, to construct a Decision Matrix and arrive at a relative ranking to identify the optimal alternative. We also present a taxonomy organized in a two level hierarchy: Server-centric clouds, Client-centric clouds and Mobile-centric clouds, which further map to detailed, specific applications or workloads. DSS presented showing algorithms derived from MADMAC can compute and optimize CA decisions separately for the three stages, where the attributes differently influence CA decisions. A modified Wide-band Delphi method is proposed for assessing the relative weights for each attribute, by workload. Relative ranks are calculated using these weights, and the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is used to generate value functions for all the alternatives, and rank the alternatives by their value to finally choose the best alternative. Results from application of the method to four different types of workloads show that the method converges on reasonable cloud adoption decisions. MADMAC's key advantage is its fully quantitative and iterative convergence approach based on proven multi-attribute decision methods, which enables decision makers to comparatively assess the relative robustness of alternative cloud adoption decisions in a defensible manner. Being amenable to automation, it can respond well to even complex arrays of decision criteria inputs, unlike human decision makers. It can be implemented as a web-based DSS to readily support cloud decision making world-wide, and improved further using fuzzy TOPSIS methods, to address concerns about preferential inter-dependence of attributes, insufficient input data or judgment expertise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MADMAC: Multiple Attribute Decision Methodology for Adoption of Clouds","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.61","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008725.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"MADMAC: Multiple Attribute Decision Methodology for Adoption of Clouds","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008725/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217338","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MADMAC: Multiple Attribute Decision Methodology for Adoption of Clouds","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064465S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008726,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Goudarzi","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Goudarzi","id":"37705173200"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008726","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1898},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-dimensional SLA-Based Resource Allocation for Multi-tier Cloud Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008726.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.106","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Time factors","Resource management","Optimization","Gold","Cloud computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional SLA-based resource allocation","service level agreements","multitier cloud computing systems","distributed computing systems","force-directed search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Resource allocation","Service Level Agreement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008726","abstract":"With increasing demand for computing and memory, distributed computing systems have attracted a lot of attention.

In this paper, an SLA-based resource allocation problem for multi-tier applications in the cloud computing is considered.

This is due to the outsourcing of enterprise IT assets hosted on third-party cloud computing platforms. Moreover, the lack of security constraints in the Service Level Agreements between the cloud providers and consumers results in a loss of trust as well. Obtaining a security certificate such as ISO 27000 or NIST-FISMA would help cloud providers improve consumers trust in their cloud platforms' security. However, such standards are still far from covering the full complexity of the cloud computing model. We introduce a new cloud security management framework based on aligning the FISMA standard to fit with the cloud computing model, enabling cloud providers and consumers to be security certified. Our framework is based on improving collaboration between cloud providers, service providers and service consumers in managing the security of the cloud platform and the hosted services. It is built on top of a number of security standards that assist in automating the security management process. We have developed a proof of concept of our framework using. NET and deployed it on a test bed cloud platform. We evaluated the framework by managing the security of a multi-tenant SaaS application exemplar.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008731.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaboration-Based Cloud Computing Security Management Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Standards","Monitoring","Process control","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","groupware","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaboration-based cloud computing security management framework","cloud computing model","Internet-based computing platform","security control","cloud-hosted assets","enterprise IT assets","third-party cloud computing platforms","security constraints","service level agreements","security certificate","ISO 27000","NIST-FISMA","consumers trust","FISMA standard","security standards","multitenant SaaS application exemplar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","cloud computing security","cloud computing security management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Collaboration-Based Cloud Computing Security Management Framework","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217344","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaboration-Based Cloud Computing Security Management Framework","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070052S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008732,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Ahmad","affiliation":["Information Systems and Operational Management, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37901721600"},{"name":"Lech Janczewski","affiliation":["Information Systems and Operational Management, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Lech","lastName":"Janczewski","id":"37888130600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008732","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":809},"abstract":"Public Cloud Computing (PCC) delivers technology \"As a Service\".

An increasing number of companies are expected to migrate their systems to cloud enabled infrastructures. However, there has not been much attention paid to provide sufficient process support. Since migration projects are likely to encounter several kinds of challenges, it is important to identify and share the process and logistical requirements of migration projects in order to build a body of knowledge of appropriate process, methods, and tools. This paper purports to contribute to the growing knowledge of how to migrate existing systems to cloud computing by reporting our effort aimed at migrating an Open Source Software (OSS) framework, Hackystat, to cloud computing. We report the main steps followed, the process and technical challenges faced, and some of the strategies that helped us to address those challenges.

The framework is shown to be scalable to thousand of computing nodes and reliable on commodity clusters. However, research has shown that there is room for performance improvement of the MapReduce framework. One of the main performance bottlenecks is caused by the all-to-all communication between mappers and reducers, which may saturate the top-of-rack switch and inflate job execution time. Reducing cross-rack communication will improve job performance. In current MapReduce implementation, the task assignment is based on the pull-model, in which cross-rack traffic is difficult to control. In contrast, the MapReduce framework allows more flexibility in assigning reducers to the computing nodes. In this paper, we investigate the reducer placement problem (RPP), which considers the placement of reducers to minimize cross-rack traffic. We devise two optimal algorithms to solve RPP and implement the algorithms in the Hadoop system. We also propose an analytical solution for this problem. Our experiment results with a set of MapReduce applications show that our optimization achieves 9% to 32%performance improvement compared with the unoptimized Hadoop.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008738/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217351","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Algorithms for Cross-Rack Communication Optimization in MapReduce Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Algorithms for Cross-Rack Communication Optimization in MapReduce Framework","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064702S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008741,"authors":[{"name":"Yilei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538317100"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

However, selecting a single storage service provider limits availability and scalability to the selected provider and may further cause a vendor lock-in effect. In this paper, we present MetaStorage, a federated Cloud storage system that can integrate diverse Cloud storage providers. MetaStorage is a highly available and scalable distributed hash table that replicates data on top of diverse storage services. MetaStorage reuses mechanisms from Amazon's Dynamo for cross-provider replication and hence introduces a novel approach to manage consistency-latency tradeoffs by extending the traditional quorum (N,R,W) configurations to an (N_P,R,W) scheme that includes different providers as an additional dimension. With MetaStorage, new means to control consistency-latency tradeoffs are introduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008742.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"459","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MetaStorage: A Federated Cloud Storage System to Manage Consistency-Latency Tradeoffs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Availability","Generators","Google","Sea measurements","Scalability","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metastorage","federated cloud storage system","consistency-latency tradeoff management","vendor lock-in effect","cloud storage providers","distributed hash table","Amazon Dynamo mechanism","cross-provider replication","traditional quorum configuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data storage systems","Distributed Computing","Middleware","Distributed Databases","Faul tolerance","Redundancy","Fault tolerant systems","Web services","Cloud Computing","Cloud Storage","Vendor Lock-in"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"MetaStorage: A Federated Cloud Storage System to Manage Consistency-Latency Tradeoffs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217355","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MetaStorage: A Federated Cloud Storage System to Manage Consistency-Latency Tradeoffs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068936S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6008743,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Fan","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Parallel & Distributed Processing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Fan","id":"37897105400"},{"name":"Ji Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Parallel & Distributed Processing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280528200"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

The growth rate of cloud computing surpasses even the most optimistic predictions. A cloud application is a large-scale distributed system that consist a lot of distributed cloud nodes. How to make optimal deployment of cloud applications is a challenging research problem. When deploying a cloud application to the cloud environment, cloud node ranking is one of the most important approaches for selecting optimal cloud nodes for the cloud application. Traditional ranking methods usually rank the cloud nodes based on their QoS values, without considering the communication performance between cloud nodes. However, such kind of node relationship is very important for the communication-intensive cloud applications (e.g., Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs), which have a lot of communications between the selected cloud nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering-based method for selecting optimal cloud nodes for deploying communication-intensive applications to the cloud environment. Our method not only takes into account the cloud node qualities, but also the communication performance between different nodes. We deploy several well-known MPI programs on a real-world cloud and compare our method with other methods. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our cluster-based method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Optimal Deployment of Communication-Intensive Cloud Applications","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008743.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Toward Optimal Deployment of Communication-Intensive Cloud Applications","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008743/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Optimal Deployment of Communication-Intensive Cloud Applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083496S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008748,"authors":[{"name":"Nilabja Roy","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Nilabja","lastName":"Roy","id":"38358797900"},{"name":"Abhishek Dubey","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Dubey","id":"37288956800"},{"name":"Aniruddha Gokhale","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Aniruddha","lastName":"Gokhale","id":"37267880500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008748","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":281,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":3944},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008748","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time factors","Resource management","Prediction algorithms","Quality of service","Virtual machining","Throughput","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","object-oriented programming","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud resources","quality of service","cloud computing","auto scaling mechanisms","client workload patterns","model-predictive algorithm","workload forecasting","optimal resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["autoscaling","workload forecasting","predictive models","cloud computing","performance models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.42","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008748.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Autoscaling in the Cloud Using Predictive Models for Workload Forecasting","abstract":"Large-scale component-based enterprise applications that leverage Cloud resources expect Quality of Service(QoS) guarantees in accordance with service level agreements between the customer and service providers. In the context of Cloud computing, auto scaling mechanisms hold the promise of assuring QoS properties to the applications while simultaneously making efficient use of resources and keeping operational costs low for the service providers. Despite the perceived advantages of auto scaling, realizing the full potential of auto scaling is hard due to multiple challenges stemming from the need to precisely estimate resource usage in the face of significant variability in client workload patterns. This paper makes three contributions to overcome the general lack of effective techniques for workload forecasting and optimal resource allocation. First, it discusses the challenges involved in auto scaling in the cloud. Second, it develops a model-predictive algorithm for workload forecasting that is used for resource auto scaling. Finally, empirical results are provided that demonstrate that resources can be allocated and deal located by our algorithm in a way that satisfies both the application QoS while keeping operational costs low.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008748/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12217361","publicationDate":"July 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008748/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Autoscaling in the Cloud Using Predictive Models for Workload Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Autoscaling in the Cloud Using Predictive Models for Workload Forecasting","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06972S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"281","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6008751,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod A.

One effective way to reduce power consumption is to consolidate the hosting workloads and shut down physical machines which become idle after consolidation. Server consolidation is a NP-hard problem. In this paper, a new algorithms Dynamic Round-Robin (DRR), is proposed for energy-aware virtual machine scheduling and consolidation. We compare this strategy with the GREEDY, ROUNDROBIN and POWERSAVE scheduling strategies implemented in the Eucalyptus Cloud system. Our experiment results show that the Dynamic Round-Robin algorithm reduce a significant amount of power consumption compared with the three strategies in Eucalyptus.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Dynamic Provision and Scheduling for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.94","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008778.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Dynamic Provision and Scheduling for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008778/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217391","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Virtual Machine Dynamic Provision and Scheduling for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070293S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008781,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Olson","affiliation":["Computing Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Olson","id":"38257479000"},{"name":"K.

Compute resources in such an environment usually cannot be provisioned or released on demand of the size of a workflow, and these resources are not released to the environment until an execution of the workflow completes. To address the problem, we firstly formalize a model of a Cloud environment and a workflow graph representation for such an environment. Then, we propose the SHEFT workflow scheduling algorithm to schedule a workflow elastically on a Cloud computing environment. Our preliminary experiments show that SHEFT not only outperforms several representative workflow scheduling algorithms in optimizing workflow execution time, but also enables resources to scale elastically at runtime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling Scientific Workflows Elastically for Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.110","startPage":"746","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008783.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Scientific Workflows Elastically for Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008783/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217396","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Scientific Workflows Elastically for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02569S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008789,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjiang Yang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yanjiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37423203300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4460-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6008789","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Databases","Cloud computing","Outsourcing","Keyword search"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","database management systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser private keyword search","cloud computing","storage-as-a-service","database outsourcing","cloud storage services","data encryption","searchable encryption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","private keyword search","searchable encryption"]}],"abstract":"Storage-as-a-service is an essential component of the cloud computing infrastructure. Database outsourcing is a typical use scenario of the cloud storage services, wherein data encryption is a good approach enabling the data owner to retain its control over the outsourced data. Searchable encryption is a cryptographic primitive allowing for private keyword based search over the encrypted database. The setting of enterprise outsourcing database to the cloud requires multi-user searchable encryption, whereas virtually all existing schemes consider the single-user setting. To bridge this gap, we propose a practical multi-user searchable encryption scheme, which has a number of advantages over the known approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2011.76","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008653/6008659/06008789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2011.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008659","startPage":"758","endPage":"759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Multi-user Private Keyword Search for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Multi-user Private Keyword Search for Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008789/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12217402","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008789/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Multi-user Private Keyword Search for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4460a758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044689S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008653","isNumber":"6008659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008653","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6008659","articleId":"6008789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008805,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Asgar Sohanghpurwala","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali Asgar","lastName":"Sohanghpurwala","id":"37888017500"},{"name":"Peter Athanas","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Athanas","id":"37271215700"},{"name":"Tannous Frangieh","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Tannous","lastName":"Frangieh","id":"37392234200"},{"name":"Aaron Wood","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute East, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Wood","id":"37896870600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008805","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Dynamic scheduling","Wires","Databases","Open source software","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","public domain software","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpenPR","open source partial reconfiguration toolkit","Xilinx FPGA","Xilinx partial reconfiguration early access software","instrumental package","ISE 12.3","Xilinx ISE 9.2 tools","Xilinx PR Toolkit"]}],"abstract":"The Xilinx Partial Reconfiguration Early Access Software Tools for ISE 9.2i has been an instrumental package for performing a wide variety of research on Xilinx FPGAs, and is now superseded with the corresponding non-free add-on for ISE 12.3. The original package was developed and offered by Xilinx as a downloadable add-on package to the Xilinx ISE 9.2 tools. The 9.2i toolkit provided a methodology for creating rectangular partial reconfiguration modules that could be swapped in and out of a static baseline design with one or more PR slots. This paper presents a new PR toolkit called Open PR that, for starters, provides similar functionality as the Xilinx PR Toolkit, yet is extendable to explore other modes of partial reconfiguration. The distinguishing feature of this toolkit is that it is being released as open source, and is intended to extend to the needs of individual researchers.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008805.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenPR: An Open-Source Partial-Reconfiguration Toolkit for Xilinx FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"OpenPR: An Open-Source Partial-Reconfiguration Toolkit for Xilinx FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008805/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenPR: An Open-Source Partial-Reconfiguration Toolkit for Xilinx FPGAs","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064513S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008810,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Wold","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Wold","id":"37887283100"},{"name":"Dirk Koch","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Koch","id":"38268904500"},{"name":"Jim Torresen","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Torresen","id":"37282129200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008810","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Tiles","Field programmable gate arrays","Resource management","Layout","Programming","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint theory","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource utilization","design alternatives","runtime reconfigurable systems","resource requirements","module bounding boxes","FPGA","field programmable gate array","placement problem","constraint satisfaction problem","constraint solver","minimization problem"]}],"abstract":"Average resource utilization in reconfigurable systems is dependent on how effectively modules are placed. Resources may be left unused because modules usually have different resource requirements, and consequently different module bounding boxes. When fitting such different modules on an FPGA, the placement can be imperfect. In order to investigate the effect of module design alternatives on resource utilization, we model the placement problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. In particular we are interested in real world FPGAs. The constraint satisfaction problem is solved using a constraint solver. The constraint problem is modelled as a minimization problem in order to attain the optimal placement. We have investigated module design alternatives which include representing the modules with different layout. We have found an increase in average resource utilization of 11% by considering module design alternatives. The computation time is short, so the method could be applied as a part of an interactive tool.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.151","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008810.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Resource Utilization with Design Alternatives in Runtime Reconfigurable Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008810/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Resource Utilization with Design Alternatives in Runtime Reconfigurable Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217417","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008810/","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Resource Utilization with Design Alternatives in Runtime Reconfigurable Systems","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058372S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008811,"authors":[{"name":"Shuli Gao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shuli","lastName":"Gao","id":"38339600400"},{"name":"Dhamin Al-Khalili","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Dhamin","lastName":"Al-Khalili","id":"38277818000"},{"name":"Noureddine Chabini","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Chabini","id":"38329966700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008811","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Large Size Signed Multipliers Using Embedded Blocks in FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008811.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Organizations","Digital signal processing","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded blocks","FPGA","asymmetric large size signed multipliers","multiplication process","optimization algorithm","adder tree","delay table method","embedded signed multipliers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008811","abstract":"In this paper, asymmetric non-pipelined large size signed multipliers are implemented using symmetric and asymmetric embedded multipliers in FPGAs. Decomposition of the operands, and consequently the multiplication process, are performed for the efficient use of the embedded blocks. Partial products are organized in various configurations, and the additions of the products are performed in an optimized manner. A heuristic method has been developed, which analyzes the timing and the area at each stage of the adder tree. The optimization algorithm, which is referred to as \"Delay-Table\" method has led to the minimization of the total critical path delay with reduced utilization of FPGA resources. The asymmetric signed multipliers are implemented in Xilinx FPGAs using 18\u00d718-bit and 25\u00d718-bit embedded signed multipliers. The implementation results have demonstrated an improvement in terms of speed and number of embedded blocks compared to the standard realization. The improvements are 27.1% in speed and 10.9% in the use of embedded multipliers when using the symmetric embedded blocks. The improvements increase further to 28.5% and 36.6%, respectively, when using asymmetric embedded multipliers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217418","htmlLink":"/document/6008811/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Large Size Signed Multipliers Using Embedded Blocks in FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Large Size Signed Multipliers Using Embedded Blocks in FPGAs","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058627S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008817,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Diego Briceno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"],"bio":{"p":["Luis D.

The ESSC is part of a collaborative effort between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to deliver research, tools, software, and technologies that can be integrated, deployed, and used in both DOE and DoD environments. The heterogeneous system and workload described here are representative of a prototypical computing environment being studied as part of this collaboration. Each task can exhibit a time-varying importance or utility to the overall enterprise. In this system, an arriving task has an associated priority and precedence. The priority is used to describe the importance of a task, and precedence is used to describe how soon the task must be executed. These two metrics are combined to create a utility function curve that indicates how valuable it is for the system to complete a task at any given moment. This research focuses on using time-utility functions to generate a metric that can be used to compare the performance of different resource schedulers in a heterogeneous computing system. The contributions of this paper are: (a) a mathematical model of a heterogeneous computing system where tasks arrive dynamically and need to be assigned based on their priority, precedence, utility characteristic class, and task execution type, (b) the use of priority and precedence to generate time-utility functions that describe the value a task has at any given time, (c) the derivation of a metric based on the total utility gained from completing tasks to measure the performance of the computing environment, and (d) a comparison of the performance of resource allocation heuristics in this environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008817/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217420","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time Utility Functions for Modeling and Evaluating Resource Allocations in a Heterogeneous Computing System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Utility Functions for Modeling and Evaluating Resource Allocations in a Heterogeneous Computing System","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148655S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008819,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulla M.

For efficient use of a large GPU-accelerated system, one important mechanism is checkpoint-restart that can be used not only to improve fault tolerance but also to optimize node/slot allocation by suspending a job on one node and migrating the job to another node. Although several checkpoint-restart implementations have been developed so far, they do not support CUDA applications or have some severe limitations for CUDA support. Hence, we present a checkpoint-restart library for CUDA that first deletes all CUDA resources before check pointing and then restores them right after check pointing. It is necessary to restore each memory chunk at the same memory address. To this end, we propose a novel technique that replays memory related API calls. The library supports both CUDA runtime API and CUDA driver API. Moreover, the library is transparent to applications, it is not necessary to recompile the applications for check pointing. This paper demonstrates that the proposed library can achieve checkpoint-restart of various applications at acceptable overheads, and the library also works for MPI applications such as HPL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NVCR: A Transparent Checkpoint-Restart Library for NVIDIA CUDA","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.131","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008825.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"NVCR: A Transparent Checkpoint-Restart Library for NVIDIA CUDA","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008825/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217428","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NVCR: A Transparent Checkpoint-Restart Library for NVIDIA CUDA","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057923S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008828,"authors":[{"name":"Roberta Piscitelli","affiliation":["Computer Systems Architecture group, Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roberta","lastName":"Piscitelli","id":"37888408200"},{"name":"Andy D.

As a consequence, the technique can be very useful in the context of early system-level design space exploration.

The application can be partitioned into modules with specific requirements e.g. parallelism or performance in relation to the provided hardware blocks on the multicore hardware. The result is an optimized application mapping and a parallel processing with lower power consumption on the different cores on the hardware. This paper presents a heterogeneous platform consisting of a microprocessor and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) connected via a standard AMBA bus. The novelty of this approach is that the FPGA is realized as virtual reconfigurable hardware upon a traditional off the shelf FPGA device. The advantage with this approach is that the specification of the virtual FPGA stays unchanged, independent to the underlying hardware and provides therefore features, which the exploited physical host FPGA cannot provide. A special feature of the presented virtual FPGA amongst others is the dynamic reconfigurability which is for example not available with all off the shelf FPGAs. Furthermore the concept of FPGA virtualization enables the re-use of hardware blocks on other physical FPGA devices. This paper presents the hardware platform and describes the tool chain for the heterogeneous system on chip.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heterogeneous Multicore System on Chip with Run-Time Reconfigurable Virtual FPGA Architecture","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.135","startPage":"143","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008830.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Heterogeneous Multicore System on Chip with Run-Time Reconfigurable Virtual FPGA Architecture","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008830/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217432","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heterogeneous Multicore System on Chip with Run-Time Reconfigurable Virtual FPGA Architecture","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059443S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008837,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Lucia Varbanescu","affiliation":["Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands","Computing Systems Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ana Lucia","lastName":"Varbanescu","id":"37698034900"},{"name":"Pieter Hijma","affiliation":["Computing Systems Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Pieter","lastName":"Hijma","id":"37888399700"},{"name":"Rob van Nieuwpoort","affiliation":["ASTRON, Dwingeloo, Netherlands","Computing Systems Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"van Nieuwpoort","id":"37284701900"},{"name":"Henri Bal","affiliation":["Computing Systems Group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henri","lastName":"Bal","id":"37276610500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008837","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"abstract":"Building an effective programming model for many-core processors is challenging. On the one hand, the increasing variety of platforms and their specific programming models force users to take a hardware-centric approach not only for implementing parallel applications, but also for designing them. This approach diminishes portability and, eventually, limits performance. On the other hand, to effectively cope with the increased number of large-scale workloads that require parallelization, a portable, application-centric programming model is desirable. Such a model enables programmers to focus first on extracting and exploiting parallelism from their applications, as opposed to generating parallelism for specific hardware, and only second on platform-specific implementation and optimizations. In this paper, we first present a survey of programming models designed for programming three families of many-cores: general purpose many-cores (GPMCs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and the Cell/B.E.. We analyze the usability of these models, their ability to improve platform programmability, and the specific features that contribute to this improvement. Next, we also discuss two types of generic models: parallelism-centric and application-centric. We also analyze their features and impact on platform programmability. Based on this analysis, we recommend two application-centric models (OmpSs and OpenCL) as promising candidates for a unified programming model for many-cores and we discuss potential enhancements for them.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Parallel processing","Computer architecture","Data models","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Productivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified programming model","many-core processors","application-centric programming model","parallelism generation","general purpose many-cores","GPMC","graphics processing units","GPU","Cell/B.E","parallelism-centric model","OmpS","OpenCL","multicore processors","many-core accelerators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008837","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.210","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.210","startPage":"681","endPage":"692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards an Effective Unified Programming Model for Many-Cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards an Effective Unified Programming Model for Many-Cores","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008837/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008837/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217439","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards an Effective Unified Programming Model for Many-Cores","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105955S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6008847,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Philipp","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Research Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Philipp","id":"37704816200"},{"name":"Manfred Glesner","affiliation":["Microelectronic Systems Research Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Glesner","id":"37277320300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008847","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Field programmable gate arrays","Heuristic algorithms","Power demand","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","energy conservation","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel reconfigurable architecture","wireless sensor node","coprocessing unit","hardware accelerator","sensor data streams","energy efficiency","reconfigurable computing mechanism","dynamic reconfiguration","accelerometer data acquisition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008847","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.162","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","abstract":"An architecture for a dynamically reconfigurable co processing unit for a wireless sensor node is presented in this paper.

Instead of it, with each vertex a number meaning a profit is associated. The problem is to find a cycle which maximizes collected profit but does not exceed a given cost constraint. A direct application of the STSP, e.g. in Intelligent Transportation Systems, is finding an optimal tour in road networks. However, while the classic STSP is defined on a complete graph, a road network is in general not complete and often has a rather sparse edge set. This paper presents the STSP defined on a road network (R-STSP). Since R-STSP is NP-hard and stands the problem with a constraint, the genetic algorithm (GA) with a penalty function is proposed. Computer experiments performed on the real road network in Poland have shown that this GA outperforms the GA searching only the feasible solution space.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.177","startPage":"381","endPage":"387","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008855.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm with a Penalty Function in the Selective Travelling Salesman Problem on a Road Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008855/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm with a Penalty Function in the Selective Travelling Salesman Problem on a Road Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008855/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12217455","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm with a Penalty Function in the Selective Travelling Salesman Problem on a Road Network","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067223S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008856,"authors":[{"name":"Bernabe Dorronsoro","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre of Security, Reliability, and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bernabe","lastName":"Dorronsoro","id":"37282630400"},{"name":"Pascal Bouvry","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Technology, and Communication, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Bouvry","id":"37282633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008856","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Shape","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Error correction codes","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular genetic algorithm","decentralized population","adaptive neighborhood","GA continuous domain","CGA combinatorial domain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008856","abstract":"Cellular genetic algorithms (cGAs) are a kind of genetic algorithms (GAs) with decentralized population in which interactions among individuals are restricted to close ones. The use of decentralized populations in GAs allows to keep the population diversity for longer, usually resulting in a better exploration of the search space and, therefore in a better performance of the algorithm. However, the use of decentralized populations supposes the need of several new parameters that have a major impact on the behavior of the algorithm. In the case of cGAs, these parameters are the population and neighborhood shapes. Hence, we propose in this work two new adaptive techniques that allow removing the neighborhood to use from the algorithm's configuration. As a result, one of the new adaptive cGAs outperform the compared cGAs with fixed neighborhoods in the continuous and combinatorial domains.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.168","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008856.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neighborhoods for Cellular Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neighborhoods for Cellular Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217456","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008856/","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neighborhoods for Cellular Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073594S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6008863,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan L.

We have identified the intra-task kernel as a major bottleneck in the CUDASW++ algorithm. We have developed a new intra-task kernel that is faster than the original intra-task kernel used in CUDASW++. We describe the development of our kernel as a series of incremental changes that provide insight into a number of issues that must be considered when developing any algorithm for the CUDA architecture. We analyze the performance of our kernel compared to the original and show that the use of our intra-task kernel substantially improves the overall performance of CUDASW++ on the order of three to four giga-cell updates per second on various benchmark databases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217468","htmlLink":"/document/6008869/","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving CUDASW++, a Parallelization of Smith-Waterman for CUDA Enabled Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving CUDASW++, a Parallelization of Smith-Waterman for CUDA Enabled Devices","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061463S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6008874,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Song","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Song","id":"37894872000"},{"name":"Yasuaki Ito","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuaki","lastName":"Ito","id":"37277391300"},{"name":"Koji Nakano","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37339557400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008874","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","logic circuits","multiplying circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CRT-based DSP decryption","Chinese remainder theorem","Montgomery modular multiplication","hardware algorithm","block RAM","logic blocks","Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA","word length 2048 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008874","abstract":"The main contribution of this paper is to present an efficient hardware algorithm for Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) based RSA decryption using Montgomery multiplication algorithm.

Hence, our implementation is close to optimal in the sense that it has only less than 5% overhead in multiplication and no further improvement is possible as long as CRT-based Montgomery multiplication based algorithm is applied. We have also succeeded in implementing 320 RSA cores in one Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA XC6VLX240T-1 which work in parallel. The implemented parallel 320 RSA cores achieve 26.2 Mbit/s throughput for 1024-bit RSA decryption.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.208","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008874.pdf","startPage":"532","endPage":"541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRT-Based DSP Decryption Using Montgomery Modular Multiplication on the FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"CRT-Based DSP Decryption Using Montgomery Modular Multiplication on the FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008874/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217472","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRT-Based DSP Decryption Using Montgomery Modular Multiplication on the FPGA","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070891S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6008882,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Sun","affiliation":["A1231, System Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37578487300"},{"name":"Tomoyoshi Sugawara","affiliation":["A1231, System Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyoshi","lastName":"Sugawara","id":"37890241600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008882","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Energy consumption","Schedules","Voltage control","Optimization","Complexity theory","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy consumption","integer programming","linear programming","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware task mapping","heterogeneous multiprocessor platform","NP-complete problem","task energy consumption","dynamic voltage scaling technique","dynamic power dissipation","integer linear programming","polynomial time algorithm"]}],"abstract":"On various heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms, it is necessary to optimize the throughput and the energy consumption. The problem of optimally mapping tasks onto a set of given heterogeneous processors for minimum overall completion time has been known, in general, to be NP-complete. The energy consumption of a task may be very different in heterogeneous processors. However, if the most energy-efficient processor for each task is always chosen in the task mapping, the completion time of a set of tasks may grow wildly in the worst case. DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) technique is currently available in a larger number of processors to effectively reduce dynamic power dissipation and consequently to save a proportion of total energy consumption, but meanwhile the execution time of a task running in lower voltage definitely becomes longer. Hence, the task mapping problem in terms of time, energy and voltage turns more complicated and harder to solve along with the heterogeneity. Moreover, today most processors only support discrete DVS and thus the optimization problem tends to be Integer Linear Programming problems for which, as we know, there is no polynomial time algorithm unless P = NP. In this paper we formulate and study the optimization problem of reducing overall completion time and the total energy consumption, and then some heuristics, which are experimentally evaluated and compared.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.209","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","startPage":"599","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristics and Evaluations of Energy-Aware Task Mapping on Heterogeneous Multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Heuristics and Evaluations of Energy-Aware Task Mapping on Heterogeneous Multiprocessors","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008882/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217480","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008882/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristics and Evaluations of Energy-Aware Task Mapping on Heterogeneous Multiprocessors","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073761S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6008904,"authors":[{"name":"Mariusz Grad","affiliation":["Paderborn Center of Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grad","id":"37903705500"},{"name":"Christian Plessl","affiliation":["Paderborn Center of Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Plessl","id":"37542909400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008904","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Kernel","Benchmark testing","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","field programmable gate arrays","instruction sets","reconfigurable architectures","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["just-in-time instruction set extension","FPGA based reconfigurable ASIP architecture","virtual machine","tool flow","Woolcano reconfigurable ASIP architecture","PowerPC core","Xilinx Virtex 4FX CPU","runtime reconfigurable instructions","SPEC2006","SPEC2000","MiBench","SciMark2","caching strategies"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the feasibility of moving the instruction set customization process for reconfigurable ASIPs to runtime under the precondition that current FPGA devices and tools are used. To this end we propose a tool flow for just-in-time ASIP customization which identifies suitable custom instructions to accelerate arbitrary binary applications that execute on a virtual machine. The tool flow targets our previously introduced Woolcano reconfigurable ASIP architecture, which augments the PowerPC core in a Xilinx Virtex 4FX CPU with runtime reconfigurable instructions. We evaluate the tool flow with a comprehensive set of applications from the SPEC2006, SPEC2000, MiBench, and SciMark2 benchmark suites and compare the speedups that can be achieved with the overhead of the complete ASIP specialization process. We show that an average speedup of 5\u00d7 can be achieved for benchmarks from the embedded computing domain. The overhead of custom instruction identification and hardware generation for these benchmarks is less than 50 minutes and will be compensated if the applications execute for more than 2 hours. Finally, we evaluate caching strategies to reduce the time until this break even point is reached.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008904.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Just-in-Time Instruction Set Extension - Feasibility and Limitations for an FPGA-Based Reconfigurable ASIP Architecture","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Just-in-Time Instruction Set Extension - Feasibility and Limitations for an FPGA-Based Reconfigurable ASIP Architecture","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217500","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6008904/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just-in-Time Instruction Set Extension - Feasibility and Limitations for an FPGA-Based Reconfigurable ASIP Architecture","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066089S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6008907,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

The RBAC mechanism forms an enhanced security framework for Grids and Clouds that will allow for interoperability between technologies in the two domains. The mechanisms being proposed here are important because the current lack of software tools and security standards in accessing distributed HPC systems and transporting Large Data Sets can add immensely to overheads in data processing or data integration times. RBAC models make policy management scalable and by virtue of being modular allow for more sophisticated access control models to be integrated with them. This paper shows how existing security standards can be leveraged for the specification and management of RBAC policies with the aim to allow disparate applications, systems and security domains to interoperate. The extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) can be used for policy specification and management across disparate organizations and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used for authentication and authorization assertions across the same. Both standards can be leveraged to facilitate policy management and enforcement, and delegation of rights.

The majority of existing scheduling techniques are based on meta-heuristics that produce good schedules with advance reservation given the current state of Cloud services or heuristics that are dynamic in nature, and map the workflow tasks to services on-the-fly, but lack the ability of generating schedules considering workflow-level optimization and user QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hybrid Heuristic for user constrained data-analytics workflow scheduling in hybrid Cloud environment by integrating the dynamic nature of heuristic based approaches as well as workflow-level optimization capability of meta-heuristic based approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by a comprehensive case study with comparison to existing techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06008944.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Heuristic for Scheduling Data Analytics Workflow Applications in Hybrid Cloud Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Processor scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Schedules","Quality of service","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data analysis","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analytics workflow application scheduling","hybrid cloud environment","cost driven environment","scheduling technique","meta-heuristics","cloud services","QoS constraint","adaptive hybrid heuristic","data-analytics workflow scheduling","workflow-level optimization capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6008944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Heuristic for Scheduling Data Analytics Workflow Applications in Hybrid Cloud Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6008944/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217538","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Heuristic for Scheduling Data Analytics Workflow Applications in Hybrid Cloud Environment","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385c966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05657S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6008944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6008967,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Steuwer","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Steuwer","id":"37888372700"},{"name":"Philipp Kegel","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Kegel","id":"37888372800"},{"name":"Sergei Gorlatch","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Gorlatch","id":"37282778400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6008967","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SkelCL - A Portable Skeleton Library for High-Level GPU Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6008967","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skeleton","Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Programming","Image reconstruction","Runtime","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abstract data types","coprocessors","formal specification","parallel programming","software libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SkelCL","portable skeleton library","high-level GPU programming","CUDA","OpenCL","general-purpose programming","graphics processing units","algorithmic skeletons","parallel computation","parallel communication","abstract vector data type","data distribution specification","Mandelbrot set computation","industrial-strength medical imaging application"]}],"abstract":"While CUDA and OpenCL made general-purpose programming for Graphics Processing Units (GPU) popular, using these programming approaches remains complex and error-prone because they lack high-level abstractions.

One of the challenges in making this possible is dependable collaboration among peers in a large-scale network. Effective maintenance of next generation distributed systems, such as clouds and second generation grids, will be nearly impossible without autonomic computing, with ever increasing scale of such systems. In addition, due to the nature of autonomous clouds to form administrative boundaries, depend able collaboration becomes a much harder problem. Employing information proxies may help improve such collaboration in existence of administrative boundaries. Although a general proxy definition can refer to many contexts, we focus on such proxies for dependable collaboration for distributed resource scheduling. Our definition of information proxies, and the particular areas we make use of them mainly contribute to the self configuring and self-optimizing fundamentals of the autonomic computing paradigm in general. By simulation, we show that information proxies help improve resource scheduling decisions that support large-scale autonomic computing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06009010.pdf","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1524","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependable Autonomic Cloud Computing with Information Proxies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Peer to peer computing","Topology","Collaboration","Cloud computing","Legged locomotion","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","grid computing","groupware","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dependable autonomic cloud computing","information proxy","higher level objectives","dependable collaboration","large-scale network","next generation distributed systems","second generation grids","autonomous clouds","administrative boundary","proxy definition","distributed resource scheduling","self configuring fundamentals","self-optimizing fundamentals","autonomic computing paradigm","resource scheduling decisions","large-scale autonomic computing systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dependable Autonomic Cloud Computing with Information Proxies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009010/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217599","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependable Autonomic Cloud Computing with Information Proxies","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385d518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071401S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6009010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6009014,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Hursey","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Hursey","id":"37689174500"},{"name":"Richard L.

As such many application developers are investigating Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) techniques to improve the efficiency of application recovery beyond what existing checkpoint/restart techniques alone can provide. Unfortunately for these application developers the libraries that their applications depend upon, like Message Passing Interface (MPI), do not have standardized fault tolerance semantics. This paper introduces the reader to a set of run-through stabilization semantics being developed by the MPI Forum's Fault Tolerance Working Group to support ABFT. Using a well-known ring communication program as the running example, this paper illustrates to application developers new to ABFT some of the issues that arise when designing a fault tolerant application. The ring program allows the paper to focus on the communication-level issues rather than the data preservation mechanisms covered by existing literature. This paper highlights a common set of issues that application developers must address in their design including program control management, duplicate message detection, termination detection, and testing. The discussion provides application developers new to ABFT with an introduction to both new interfaces becoming available, and a range of design issues that they will likely need to address regardless of their research domain.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.308","startPage":"1549","endPage":"1556","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06009014.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a Fault Tolerant MPI Application: A Ring Communication Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Building a Fault Tolerant MPI Application: A Ring Communication Example","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009014/","accessionNumber":"12217603","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009014/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building a Fault Tolerant MPI Application: A Ring Communication Example","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385d549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054359S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6009014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6009056,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Costa","affiliation":["CISUC, Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Costa","id":"37895472400"},{"name":"Luis Silva","affiliation":["Laboratory for Advanced Systems Research, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Silva","id":"38182988500"},{"name":"Michael Dahlin","affiliation":["Laboratory for Advanced Systems Research, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Dahlin","id":"37273138700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6009056","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Prototypes","Internet","Peer to peer computing","Hardware","Fires","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","middleware","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["volunteer cloud computing","MapReduce","Internet","computing resources","distributed independent task","master-worker model","middleware","BOINC","distributed resources","computational devices","pull-model"]}],"abstract":"Volunteer Computing harnesses computing resources of machines from around the world to perform distributed independent tasks, following a master/worker model. Despite the recent increase in popularity and power in middleware such as BOINC, there are still several limitations in existing systems. Current research is oriented towards optimizing existing applications, while the number of active users and projects has reached a plateau. A programming paradigm that has been significantly popular and is used by several systems on the cloud is MapReduce. The main advantage of this paradigm is that it can be used to solve a vast amount of different problems, by breaking them into simple steps and taking advantage of distributed resources. Volunteer Computing provides these resources, and although it cannot match the conditions offered by a cluster, it has other advantages that can be leveraged. In this paper, we try to increase the computational power of Volunteer Computing systems by allowing more complex applications and paradigms such as MapReduce to be run, thus opening new avenues and possibilities for the use of computational devices scattered through the Internet. We created a BOINC prototype that can run MapReduce jobs (BOINC-MR), using a pull-model in which communication is always initiated by the client. By running experiments on a small cluster, with multiple variables, we were able to evaluate a few initial scenarios with this paradigm. We used a simple MapReduce application, word count, as proof of concept, just to demonstrate a typical execution.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.345","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06009056.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","startPage":"1855","endPage":"1862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volunteer Cloud Computing: MapReduce over the Internet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Volunteer Cloud Computing: MapReduce over the Internet","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12217642","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009056/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volunteer Cloud Computing: MapReduce over the Internet","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385d855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057375S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6009056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6009083,"authors":[{"name":"Kamil Rocki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Rocki","id":"37891630600"},{"name":"Reiji Suda","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Reiji","lastName":"Suda","id":"37667532400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-425-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6009083","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":901},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009083","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Parallel processing","Games","Monte Carlo methods","Search problems","Kernel","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computer games","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","decision making","Monte Carlo methods","parallel processing","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale parallel Monte Carlo tree search","artificial intelligence","optimal decision making","combinatorial games","random simulation","AI GPU based agent","graphic processing to unit","Reversi game","Othello","nonuniform structure","branching factor","parallel GPU MCTS","block parallelism scheme","GPU SIMD thread groups","intra-GPU communication","inter-GPU communication","TSUBAME 2.0 system","simultaneous CPU-GPU execution"]}],"abstract":"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a method for making optimal decisions in artificial intelligence (AI) problems, typically move planning in combinatorial games. It combines the generality of random simulation with the precision of tree search. The motivation behind this work is caused by the emerging GPU-based systems and their high computational potential combined with relatively low power usage compared to CPUs. As a problem to be solved I chose to develop an AI GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)-based agent in the game of Reversi (Othello) which provides a sufficiently complex problem for tree searching with non-uniform structure and an average branching factor of over 8. I present an efficient parallel GPU MCTS implementation based on the introduced 'block-parallelism' scheme which combines GPU SIMD thread groups and performs independent searches without any need of intra-GPU or inter-GPU communication. I compare it with a simple leaf parallel scheme which implies certain performance limitations. The obtained results show that using my GPU MCTS implementation on the TSUBAME 2.0 system one GPU can be compared to 100-200 CPU threads depending on factors such as the search time and other MCTS parameters in terms of obtained results. I propose and analyze simultaneous CPU/GPU execution which improves the overall result.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008655/6008799/06009083.pdf","startPage":"2034","endPage":"2037","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search on GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search on GPU","htmlLink":"/document/6009083/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217666","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search on GPU","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385e034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039927S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008655","isNumber":"6008799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008655","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6008799","articleId":"6009083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6009154,"authors":[{"name":"Vinicius N.

This residual redundancy can be exploited by iterative source-channel decoding (ISCD) to improve the robustness against transmission noise by performing soft parameter detection as part of the decoding process. Systems employing ISCD at the receiving end often exhibit an observable error floor. While this error floor can be tolerated in some cases, it is often desirable to perfectly reconstruct the source codec parameters. In this paper, we explain the reasons for the error floor and propose two solutions for realizing ISCD systems with optimized error floor performance while maintaining the desired near-capacity waterfall behavior. All approaches aim at optimizing the distance properties of the (redundant) mapping of bit patterns to the source codec parameters. In some cases, especially if small quantizer code books are employed, good mappings cannot be found-in this case, the novel multi-dimensional bit mapping allows to reduce the error floor after decoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","volume":"5","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12360022","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009164/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Source\u2013Channel Decoding With Reduced Error Floors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Source\u2013Channel Decoding With Reduced Error Floors","sourcePdf":"jstsp-schmalen-2167216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089835S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6069495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6069495","articleId":"6009164","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6009168,"authors":[{"name":"Jill S.

These processes are often performed by human operators and are thus subject to error and bias. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as neural networks (NN) and fuzzy systems, have been applied to develop autonomous classification algorithms and have shown promising results. Genetic programming (GP), a relatively new AI method, has also been examined for these classification purposes. In this letter, the results of a comparison between the classification performances of NN versus the GP techniques for GPR UXO data are presented. Simulated 2-D scattering patterns from one UXO target and four non-UXO objects are used in this comparison. Different levels of noise and cases of untrained data are also examined. Obtained results show that GP provides better performance than NN methods with increasing problem difficulty. Genetic programming also showed robustness to untrained data as well as an inherent capability of providing global optimal searching, which could minimize efforts on training processes.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2167120","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/06009168.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"974","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2167120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Buried Targets Using Ground Penetrating Radar: Comparison Between Genetic Programming and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Buried Targets Using Ground Penetrating Radar: Comparison Between Genetic Programming and Neural Networks","volume":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12266088","publicationDate":"2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009168/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Buried Targets Using Ground Penetrating Radar: Comparison Between Genetic Programming and Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"lawp-iskander-2167120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074733S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"6009168","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009185,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/6009185/6009185-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Tang (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and the M.Sc. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.","During the summer of 2007, he was a visiting scholar with the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark, where he worked on the control of grid-interfaced inverters and uninterruptible power supplies."]},"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37403083500"},{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/6009185/6009185-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Poh Chiang Loh (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng.

With an LCL filter added at its output, the proposed SAPF offers superior switching harmonic suppression using much reduced passive filtering elements. Its output currents thus have high slew rate for tracking the targeted reference closely. Smaller inductance of the LCL filter also means smaller harmonic voltage drop across the passive output filter, which in turn minimizes the possibility of overmodulation, particularly for cases where high modulation index is desired. These advantages, together with overall system stability, are guaranteed only through proper consideration of critical design and control issues, like the selection of LCL parameters, interactions between resonance damping and harmonic compensation, bandwidth design of the closed-loop system, and active damping implementation with fewer current sensors. These described design concerns, together with their generalized design procedure, are applied to an analytical example, and eventually verified by both simulation and experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Design of High Performance Shunt Active Power Filter With Output LCL Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6058663/06009185.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Design of High Performance Shunt Active Power Filter With Output LCL Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6009185/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12308605","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Design of High Performance Shunt Active Power Filter With Output LCL Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-gao-2167117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075638S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6058663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"359","xplore-issue":"6058663","articleId":"6009185","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6009186,"authors":[{"name":"Junrui Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6063570/6009186/6009186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junrui Liang (S'09\u2013M'10) was born in Guangdong, China, in 1982.

Furthermore, the introduction of its self-powered feature makes this technique more applicable for stand-alone systems. In this paper, a modified circuit and an improved analysis for the self-powered SSHI (SP-SSHI) are proposed. With the modified circuit, direct peak detection and better isolation among different units within the circuit are achieved, both of which result in the further removal on the dissipative components. In the improved analysis, details in the open circuit voltage, switching phase lag, and intermediate voltages among different phases are discussed, all of which lead to a better understanding on the working principle of SP-SSHI. The total power dissipation from the piezoelectric source is also investigated. It is of concern but has not been considered in the previous literatures. Both analyses and experiments show that, in terms of the harvested power, the higher the excitation level, the closer between SP-SSHI and ideal (externally powered) SSHI; at the same time, the more beneficial the adoption of SP-SSHI treatment in PEH, compared to the standard energy harvesting (SEH) technique. Under the four excitation levels investigated, the SP-SSHI can harvest up to 200% more power than the SEH interface circuit.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6063570/06009186.pdf","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6063570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved Design and Analysis of Self-Powered Synchronized Switch Interface Circuit for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Systems","volume":"59","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009186/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12328310","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009186/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Design and Analysis of Self-Powered Synchronized Switch Interface Circuit for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-liao-2167116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067418S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6063570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6063570","articleId":"6009186","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6009187,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Rivera","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Rivera","id":"37397783300"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279149900"},{"name":"Patrick W.

While understanding the control potentials of T2 FLCs can still be considered an open question researchers, commonly claim superiority of T2 FLCs based on a limited exploration of the space of design parameters. The contribution of this work is based on a problem-driven design of uncertainty-robust Interval T2 (IT2) FLCs. The presented methodology starts with a baseline optimized T1 FLC. Next, a group of IT2 FLCs is designed using partially dependent approach by symmetrically blurring the membership functions around the original T1 fuzzy sets. This constrained design space allows for its systematic exploration and analysis. The performance of the designed controllers was evaluated on delta parallel robot hardware under two kinds of commonly encountered uncertainties: i) sensory noise and ii) uncertain system parameters. The experimental results showed that IT2 FLCs provide improved control performance against T1 FLCs when appropriate design of IT2 fuzzy sets is performed. In addition, it was demonstrated that excessive amount of \u201ctype-2 fuzziness\u201d in the IT2 FLC design leads to rapid performance degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6056501/06009194.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2166786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2166786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty-Robust Design of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller for Delta Parallel Robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Fuzzy sets","Robot sensing systems","Parallel robots","Fuzzy logic","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy control","fuzzy set theory","robots","robust control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller","uncertainty-robust design","uncertainty-robust interval T2 FLCs","Tl FLC","membership functions","systematic exploration","delta parallel robot hardware","sensory noise","uncertain system parameters","fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta parallel robot","interval type-2 fuzzy logic control (T2 FLC)","robustness","uncertainty handling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty-Robust Design of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller for Delta Parallel Robot","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6009194/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12332401","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty-Robust Design of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller for Delta Parallel Robot","sourcePdf":"tii-linda-2166786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064494S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6056501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6056501","articleId":"6009194","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009195,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Toscano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6179486/6009195/6009195-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emanuele Toscano received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree (summa cum laude) in computer engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

However, it is known that beacon collisions can undermine the reliability of cluster-tree networks, causing loss of synchronization between nodes and their coordinator. For this reason, this paper proposes a Multichannel Superframe Scheduling (MSS) algorithm, a novel technique that avoids beacon collisions by scheduling superframes over different radio channels, while maintaining the connectivity of all the clusters. The paper describes the MSS algorithm and addresses the advantages it provides over the time-division superframe scheduling.

It records an application run in the field so that it can deterministically be replayed offline in a development system for debugging purposes. To enable deterministic replay debugging, it is necessary to record all external influences and sources of nondeterminism in the original program run. From that trace log and from a known initial state, the program can be replayed deterministically without requiring any connection to the original environment. In this paper, we present a solution for deterministic replay debugging of hard real-time multitasking SoftPLC applications written in the IEC 61131-3 languages. By taking advantage of the special properties of these programs and by careful engineering, our technique allows recording a SoftPLC application run in the field with minimal overhead and obeying real-time constraints. In later phases, which are offline, the original program run is reconstructed from the minimal information recorded so it can be replayed for debugging. In comparison to previous work, our solution has several advantages: Instead of recording task scheduling information, it reconstructs the task interleaving based on data dependencies, thereby significantly simplifying the recording phase. Additionally, it incorporates a technique for periodically capturing the complete internal state of the system, which can later be used as a starting point for replay. We present the conceptual basis of our approach, a tool chain which provides deterministic replay debugging to the user as a set of fully automated tools, and an evaluation as well as an industrial case study for validating the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2166768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6056501/06009197.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2166768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Solution for Deterministic Replay Debugging of SoftPLC Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009197/","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Solution for Deterministic Replay Debugging of SoftPLC Applications","volume":"7","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009197/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12332402","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Solution for Deterministic Replay Debugging of SoftPLC Applications","sourcePdf":"tii-prahofer-2166768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108609S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6056501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6056501","articleId":"6009197","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009200,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P.

Two single-element DFE-IDMA and DFE-CDMA receivers are proposed that utilize chip-level adaptive decision feedback equalization (DFE) and carrier phase tracking along with iterative interference cancellation (IC) and channel coding. The receiver equations describing the detection algorithms are derived and their performance is investigated and compared. To track and compensate for the channel effects, the DFE and carrier phase tracking units are jointly optimized based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion and adapted iteratively by exchanging soft information in terms of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) estimates with the turbo processing stage. The detection is implemented by using soft chip cancellation to remove multiple-access interference (MAI) effects between users. The performance of the proposed receiver structures is investigated and compared in short-range shallow-water acoustic channels using offline processing of signals acquired during sea trials in the North Sea. Results for synchronous multiuser scenarios, with two and four users at an effective rate of 439.5 b/s per user, demonstrate that the proposed DFE-based IDMA and CDMA receivers can provide bit error rate (BER) performances of approximately 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n at an average signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of 11 dB . The experimental results also demonstrate that these direct adaptive receivers have better performance and significantly mitigate the bit errors associated with the channel estimation (CE)-based IDMA and CDMA receivers with Rake reception while maintaining lower complexity. Furthermore, in some cases, the receivers with partial knowledge of the interleavers' patterns or codes can still achieve performance comparable to those with full knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2011.2164954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6042360/06009202.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2164954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6042360","startPage":"728","endPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Multiuser Detection for Underwater Acoustic Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Multiuser Detection for Underwater Acoustic Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009202/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12301641","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009202/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Multiuser Detection for Underwater Acoustic Channels","sourcePdf":"joe-aliesawi-2164954-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105397S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6042360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6042360","articleId":"6009202","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009205,"authors":[{"name":"Saurav Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6009205/6009205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saurav Bandyopadhyay (S'08) received the B.Tech.

An I-C DAC pulse width modulator with sleep mode control is proposed which is both area and power-efficient as compared with previously published pulse width modulator schemes. Both pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and pulse width modulation (PWM) modes of control are employed for the wide load range. The converter achieves a peak efficiency of 75% at 20 \u03bcA, 87.4% at 12 mA in PFM, and 87.2% at 53 mA in PWM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","volume":"46","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12388380","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009205/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"20 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>A to 100 mA DC\u2013DC Converter With 2.8-4.2 V Battery Supply for Portable Applications in 45 nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"20 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex> </formula>A to 100 mA DC\u2013DC Converter With 2.8-4.2 V Battery Supply for Portable Applications in 45 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-bandyopadhyay-2162914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081079S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6079316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6079316","articleId":"6009205","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6009206,"authors":[{"name":"Munkyo Seo","affiliation":["Teledyne Scientific Company, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6031177/6009206/6009206-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Munkyo Seo (SM'11) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), in 2007.","From 1997 to 2002, he was an RF Engineer with LG Electronics Inc., designing RF/microwave subsystems for wireless communication.

Despite the importance of the hidden terminal problem, there have been a relatively small number of studies that consider the effect of hidden terminals on IEEE 802.11 throughput, and many are not accurate for a wide range of conditions.

Simulation results show that our model is accurate in a wide variety of cases.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2165322","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6183048/06009215.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2165322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6183048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE 802.11 Saturation Throughput Analysis in the Presence of Hidden Terminals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"IEEE 802.11 Saturation Throughput Analysis in the Presence of Hidden Terminals","volume":"20","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12673843","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009215/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009215/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE 802.11 Saturation Throughput Analysis in the Presence of Hidden Terminals","sourcePdf":"tnet-jang-2165322-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10453S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6183048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6183048","articleId":"6009215","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6009220,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6009220/6009220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Di Wu (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

While favorable for simplicity and scalability, these systems have three shortcomings: 1) high time complexity of the local feature detection; 2) discriminability reduction of local descriptors due to BOF quantization; and 3) neglect of the geometric relationships among local features after BOF representation. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework by using graphics processing units (GPU). The main contributions of our method are: 1) a new fast local feature detector coined Harris-Hessian (H-H) is designed according to the characteristics of GPU to accelerate the local feature detection; 2) the spatial information around each local feature is incorporated to improve its discriminability, supplying semi-local spatial coherent verification (LSC); and 3) a new pairwise weak geometric consistency constraint (P-WGC) algorithm is proposed to refine the search result. Additionally, part of the system is implemented on GPU to improve efficiency. Experiments conducted on reference datasets and a dataset of one million images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of H-H, LSC, and P-WGC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Feature Detection and Effective Post-Verification for Large Scale Near-Duplicate Image Search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2011.2167224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/6069890/06009225.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2011.2167224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069890","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Feature Detection and Effective Post-Verification for Large Scale Near-Duplicate Image Search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6009225/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Feature Detection and Effective Post-Verification for Large Scale Near-Duplicate Image Search","sourcePdf":"tmm-xie-2167224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119485S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6069890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6069890","articleId":"6009225","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009226,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobing Nie","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6062577/6009226/6009226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaobing Nie received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Yantai Normal University, Yantai, China, in 1999, the M.S. degree from East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010, both in applied mathematics.","He has been with the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University.

In this paper, we propose a modified matching pursuit algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The idea is to replace the correlation step of the OMP, with a neural network. Simulation results show that in the case of random sparse signal reconstruction, the proposed method performs as well as the OMP. Complexity overhead, for training and then integrating the network in the sparse signal recovery is thus not justified in this case. However, if the signal has an added structure, it is learned and incorporated in the proposed new OMP. We consider three structures: first, the sparse signal is positive, second the positions of the non zero coefficients of the sparse signal follow a certain spatial probability density function, the third case is a combination of both. Simulation results show that, for these signals of interest, the probability of exact recovery with our modified OMP increases significantly. Comparisons with \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n based reconstructions are also performed.

Moreover, most PV modules are designed for stand-alone applications that have output voltage adapted to lead batteries. Indeed, this historical sizing of PV modules can be discussed in the case of grid-connected systems. In this paper, a cascaded dc/dc converter based on boost chopper is proposed. First, the advantages and the limits of this topology will be shown. Second, this topology will be optimized to maximize the efficiency or minimize the volume. The originality of this optimization is that the converters' parameters and the arrangement of the PV cells are variable parameters. Indeed, the optimization is done on the entire system. To realize these optimizations, semiempiric models of losses and volumes of different components of a boost chopper were developed. The optimization uses a successive quadratic programming algorithm. Considering the optimization results over the whole range of the specifications, a flexible solution is developed and experimental results are presented. Finally, optimized topologies connected to several PV are evaluated at different situations of typical shadows.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2167159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2167159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155180","startPage":"2018","endPage":"2027","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6155180/06009230.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009230","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Topology","Mathematical model","Inductance","Europe","DC-DC power converters","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["choppers (circuits)","DC-DC power convertors","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","power system interconnection","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic systems","topology optimization","cascaded DC-DC converter","PV modules","grid connected systems","boost chopper","PV cells","semiempiric models","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC/DC converter","optimization","photovoltaic","power electronics","shade"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization and Design of a Cascaded DC/DC Converter Devoted to Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12543548","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6009230/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009230/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and Design of a Cascaded DC/DC Converter Devoted to Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-ferrieux-2167159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077143S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6155180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6155180","articleId":"6009230","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6009233,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Representing the nonlinear plant using a polynomial fuzzy model, an SDOF fuzzy controller is proposed to perform the control process using the system output information. As only the system output is available for feedback compensation, it is more challenging for the controller design and system analysis compared to the full-state-feedback case. Furthermore, because of the sampling activity, the control signal is kept constant by the zero-order hold during the sampling period, which complicates the system dynamics and makes the stability analysis more difficult. In this paper, two cases of SDOF fuzzy controllers, which either share the same number of fuzzy rules or not, are considered. The system stability is investigated based on the Lyapunov stability theory using the sum-of-squares (SOS) approach. SOS-based stability conditions are obtained to guarantee the system stability and synthesize the SDOF fuzzy controller. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the merits of the proposed SDOF fuzzy control approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6129833/06009233.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems Using Sampled-Data Output-Feedback Fuzzy Controller Based on Polynomial-Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Control systems","Polynomials","Numerical stability","Mathematical model","Asymptotic stability","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control system analysis","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","poles and zeros","polynomials","sampled data systems","signal sampling","stability","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system stabilization","sampled-data output-feedback fuzzy controller","polynomial-fuzzy-model-based control approach","control process","system output information","feedback compensation","controller design","system analysis","full-state-feedback case","sampling activity","control signal","zero-order hold","system dynamics","stability analysis","SDOF fuzzy controllers","Lyapunov stability theory","sum-of-squares approach","SOS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","output feedback","polynomial-fuzzy-model-based (PFMB) control","polynomial fuzzy system","sampled-data control","stability analysis","sum of squares (SOS)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Fuzzy Logic","Nonlinear Dynamics","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems Using Sampled-Data Output-Feedback Fuzzy Controller Based on Polynomial-Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Approach","volume":"42","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6009233/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471823","pubMedId":"21900076","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems Using Sampled-Data Output-Feedback Fuzzy Controller Based on Polynomial-Fuzzy-Model-Based Control Approach","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-lam-2163796-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097346S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6129833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6129833","articleId":"6009233","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009234,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Hsiang Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6045674/6009234/6009234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chu-Hsiang Huang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in communication engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

In this paper, we resolve the hidden terminal problem in spectrum sensing for CRs by a single sensor by applying a unified decision based on heterogeneous information, which enables decisions from multiple heterogeneous observations. Dual-observation time-division (DTD) spectrum sensing is proposed to identify spectrum opportunities for CRs by achieving sensing diversity through a single sensor. The sensor in DTD spectrum sensing simultaneously detects the primary transmitter's data transmission and primary receiver's feedback message transmission; thus, DTD spectrum sensing equivalently implements receiving diversity by creating multiple kinds of observations solely from a single terminal/sensor. Performance analysis and simulation results show that DTD spectrum sensing can achieve and transcend the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing, even with a single sensing node. Moreover, DTD spectrum sensing is shown to be robust without sufficient knowledge about the primary system in practical CR operating scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2167165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/06009234.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2167165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"3712","endPage":"3725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Observation Time-Division Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Observation Time-Division Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009234/","volume":"60","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6009234/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300450","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Observation Time-Division Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2167165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088061S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"6009234","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6009243,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University, USA"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281461700"},{"name":"Wei Tan","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

However, our study indicates that scientific services are currently poorly reused in an ad hoc style. This project aims to help domain scientists find interested services and reuse successful processes to attain their research purposes in the form of workflows. In contrast to existing interface-based services discovery approaches, this paper proposes a novel approach of proactively recommending services in a workflow composition process, based on service usage history. The underpinning is a People-Service-Workflow (PSW) network that models existing scientific artifacts, services and workflows, and their past usage relationships into a social network. Various social network analysis techniques are applied to discover hidden knowledge accrued.

In this paper we aim to answer focusing on one such question: how to improve performance and availability of services hosted on IaaS clouds. Our system, structural constraint-aware virtual machine placement (SCAVP), supports three types of constraints: demand, communication and availability. We formulate SCAVP as an optimization problem and show its hardness. We design a hierarchical placement approach with four approximation algorithms that efficiently solves the SCAVP problem for large problem sizes. We provide a formal model for the application (to better understand structural constraints) and the datacenter (to effectively capture capabilities), and use the two models as inputs to the placement problem. We evaluate SCAVP in a simulated environment to illustrate the efficiency and importance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.28","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Performance and Availability of Services Hosted on IaaS Clouds with Structural Constraint-Aware Virtual Machine Placement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Performance and Availability of Services Hosted on IaaS Clouds with Structural Constraint-Aware Virtual Machine Placement","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009246/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220491","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009246/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Performance and Availability of Services Hosted on IaaS Clouds with Structural Constraint-Aware Virtual Machine Placement","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058577S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6009266,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastien Mosser","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Laboratoire LIFL-CNRS UMR 8022, University of Lille 1, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Mosser","id":"37304134800"},{"name":"Gabriel Hermosillo","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Laboratoire LIFL-CNRS UMR 8022, University of Lille 1, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Hermosillo","id":"37296882200"},{"name":"Anne-Francoise Le Meur","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Laboratoire LIFL-CNRS UMR 8022, University of Lille 1, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Anne-Francoise","lastName":"Le Meur","id":"37279933100"},{"name":"Lionel Seinturier","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Laboratoire LIFL-CNRS UMR 8022, University of Lille 1, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Seinturier","id":"37267071300"},{"name":"Laurence Duchien","affiliation":["INRIA Lille Nord Europe, Laboratoire LIFL-CNRS UMR 8022, University of Lille 1, Lille, France"],"firstName":"Laurence","lastName":"Duchien","id":"37296884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undoing Event-Driven Adaptation of Business Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Engines","Monitoring","History","Servers","Context","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","formal logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static process","business logic","business process adaptation","event-driven environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event Driven Approach","Business Process","Adaptation"]}],"abstract":"As business processes continue to gain relevance in different domains, dynamicity is becoming a great concern. Static processes no longer cover the actual needs of constantly changing environments, and process adaptation is a must in order to maintain competitive levels. While creating dynamically adaptable business processes can be a challenging task, undoing these adaptations is a natural functionality that has not been studied in depth. Straight forward approaches for unadaptation can easily end up with corrupted processes, bringing uncertainty to the whole business logic. In this paper we bring forward a solution for efficiently undoing a business process adaptation in event-driven environments, considering also the correlated adaptations that happened afterwards.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.58","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009266.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.58","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009266/","displayDocTitle":"Undoing Event-Driven Adaptation of Business Processes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220511","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009266/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undoing Event-Driven Adaptation of Business Processes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085475S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6009268,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shen","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279547000"},{"name":"Ghassan Beydoun","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"Beydoun","id":"37627251400"},{"name":"Shuai Yuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37536375600"},{"name":"Graham Low","affiliation":["Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Graham","lastName":"Low","id":"37388841200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009268","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"abstract":"One of the challenges for the P2P-based service composition process is how to effectively discover and select the most appropriate peers to execute the service applications when considering multiple properties of the requested services. Different ontology-based e-service profiles have been proposed to facilitate handling multiple properties and to enhance the service oriented process in order to achieve the total or partial automation of service discovery, selection and composition. This paper investigates how the ACO (Ant Colony Optimisation) algorithm and the GA (Genetic Algorithm) may facilitate P2P-based (Peer-to-Peer) service selection with multiple service properties. The performance of both algorithms is evaluated and compared statistically using a pooled t-test for 30 randomly generated composition scenarios. Our experimental results show that both algorithms can improve the quality of service composition, while showing that the ACO approach is the more effective.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009268.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Bio-inspired Algorithms for Peer Selection in Services Composition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Peer to peer computing","Genetic algorithms","Ontologies","Web services","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","electronic commerce","genetic algorithms","peer-to-peer computing","quality of service","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P2P","service composition","bio-inspired algorithms","ontology","service oriented process","service discovery","ACO","ant colony optimisation","GA","genetic algorithm","quality of service","e-service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Web services","quality of service","peer-to-peer","service composition","algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Bio-inspired Algorithms for Peer Selection in Services Composition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220513","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Bio-inspired Algorithms for Peer Selection in Services Composition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097625S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6009283,"authors":[{"name":"Shadi Ibrahim","affiliation":["Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shadi","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37683782700"},{"name":"Bingsheng He","affiliation":["Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bingsheng","lastName":"He","id":"37532755800"},{"name":"Hai Jin","affiliation":["Cluster and Grid Computing Laboratory, Services Computing Technology and System Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276607900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009283","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1072},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Pay-As-You-Consume Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009283","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Pricing","Virtual machining","Throughput","Hardware","Benchmark testing","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","pricing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pay-as-you-consume cloud computing","public virtualized cloud","pay-as-you-go pricing","virtual machine hours","microeconomics","scheduling","resource consumption","machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Virtualization","Pay-As-You-Go","Pay-As-You-Consume","Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing enables users to perform their computation tasks in the public virtualized cloud using a pay-as-you-go style. Current pay-as-you-go pricing schemes typically charge on the incurred virtual machine hours. Our case studies demonstrate significant variations in the user costs, indicating significant unfairness among different users from the micro-economic perspective. Further studies reveal the reason for such variations is interference among concurrent virtual machines. The amount of interference cost depends on various factors, including workload characteristics, the number of concurrent VMs, and scheduling in the cloud. In this paper, we adopt the concept of pricing fairness from micro economics, and quantitatively analyze the impact of interference on the pricing fairness. To solve the unfairness caused by interference, we propose a pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme, which charges users according to their effective resource consumption excluding interference. The key idea behind the pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme is a machine learning based prediction model of the relative cost of interference. Our preliminary results with Xen demonstrate the accuracy of the prediction model, and the fairness of the pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.38","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009283.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards Pay-As-You-Consume Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220528","htmlLink":"/document/6009283/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Pay-As-You-Consume Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148802S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6009289,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Mi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Mi","id":"37529794800"},{"name":"Huaimin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Huaimin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292557700"},{"name":"Gang Yin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37411347800"},{"name":"Hua Cai","affiliation":["Monitor and Data Analysis, Alibaba Cloud Company Limited, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Cai","id":"37715484800"},{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["Monitor and Data Analysis, Alibaba Cloud Company Limited, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37711333200"},{"name":"Tingtao Sun","affiliation":["Monitor and Data Analysis, Alibaba Cloud Company Limited, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tingtao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37712018300"},{"name":"Yangfan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yangfan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37288682700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009289","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluctuations","Cloud computing","Degradation","Principal component analysis","Indexes","Instruments","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","graph theory","large-scale systems","online operation","real-time systems","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","large-scale systems","performance degradation","online anomaly detection","Magnifier","execution path graph","hierarchical structure","real-world enterprise system"]}],"abstract":"In large-scale cloud computing systems, even a simple user request may go through numerous of services that are deployed on different physical machines. As a result, it is a great challenge to online localize the prime causes of performance degradation in such systems. Existing end-to-end request tracing approaches are not suitable for online anomaly detection because their time complexity is exponential in the size of the trace logs. In this paper, we propose an approach, namely Magnifier, to rapidly diagnose the source of performance degradation in large-scale non-stop cloud systems. In Magnifier, the execution path graph of a user request is modeled by a hierarchical structure including component layer, module layer and function layer, and anomalies are detected from higher layer to lower layer separately. In each layer every node is assigned a newly created identifier in addition to the global identifier of the request, which significantly decreases the size of parsing trace logs and accelerates the anomaly detection process. We conduct extensive experiments over a real-world enterprise system (the Alibaba cloud computing platform) providing services for the public. The results show that Magnifier can locate the prime causes of performance degradation more accurately and efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.25","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","startPage":"418","endPage":"425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnifier: Online Detection of Performance Problems in Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Magnifier: Online Detection of Performance Problems in Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009289/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220534","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6009289/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnifier: Online Detection of Performance Problems in Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10761S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6009326,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China","Suzhou Institute of USTC, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37676580400"},{"name":"Junneng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Junneng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37717262700"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China","Suzhou Institute of USTC, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406428200"},{"name":"Xiaojing Feng","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute of USTC, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Feng","id":"37714391500"},{"name":"Xiaoning Nie","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiaoning","lastName":"Nie","id":"37283233600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009326","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"abstract":"Multi-processor system on chip (MPSoC) has been widely applied in embedded systems design. However, it has posed great challenges in designing and implementing prototype chip for diverse applications due to different instruction set architectures (ISA), programming interfaces and software tool chains. In order to solve the problem, we introduce SOA into MPSoC design, because it can provide flexibility and extensibility for MPSoC chip design at lower cost through adopting re-usable, self-contained modules in the design process. In this paper, we propose a service-oriented multi-processor SOMP, which integrates embedded processors and hardware IP cores as computing servants on a single chip. SOMP provides unified programming interfaces for users through utilizing diverse computing resources. In order to demonstrate the performance of SOMP, we implemented it on a Digilent Virtex5LX110T FPGA board and designed several sample test applications for verification purpose. The experimental results show that SOMP can improve the parallelism greatly and achieve 95.7% of the theoretical speedup on average.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009326.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"716","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOMP: Service-Oriented Multi Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Program processors","Processor scheduling","Computer architecture","Scheduling","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","instruction sets","logic design","multiprocessing systems","service-oriented architecture","software tools","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOMP","service-oriented multiprocessor","multiprocessor system-on-chip","embedded system design","prototype chip","instruction set architecture","programming interface","software tool chain","SOA","MPSoC chip design","self-contained module","embedded processor","hardware IP cores","Digilent Virtex5LX110T FPGA board"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service-oriented","Multi processor system on chip","Run-time scheduling","Run-time reconfiguration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"SOMP: Service-Oriented Multi Processors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009326/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220571","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOMP: Service-Oriented Multi Processors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4462a709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.422004S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009116","isNumber":"6009236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009116","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6009236","articleId":"6009326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6009329,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37538830200"},{"name":"Yipeng Feng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yipeng","lastName":"Feng","id":"37893616600"},{"name":"Jian Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404829500"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0863-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4462-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009329","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009329","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Web services","Equations","Accuracy","Mathematical model","Copper","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction theory","quality of service","service-oriented architecture","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced QoS prediction approach","QoS-based service selection","cosine equation","data smoothing process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["service selection","QoS prediction","collaborative filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SCC.2011.46","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009116/6009236/06009329.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","startPage":"727","endPage":"728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2011.46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced QoS Prediction Approach for Service Selection","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an enhanced QoS prediction approach to predict the missing QoS values for QoS-based selection.

A number of negotiation supporting techniques have been used to find solutions that are acceptable to all parties in the negotiation. However, employing these solutions for automated negotiations among Web services has its own challenges. In this paper, we present the design of a Negotiation Web service that would be used by both the consumers and providers of Web services for conducting negotiations. This negotiation service uses a genetic algorithm(GA) based approach for finding acceptable solutions in multi-party and multi-objective negotiations. In addition to the traditional genetic operators of crossover and mutation, the search is enhanced using anew operator called the Norm. Norm operator represents the cumulative knowledge of all the parties involved in the negotiation process. GA performance with the new Norm operator is compared to the traditional GA, hill-climber and random search techniques. Experimental results indicate the practicality of our approach in facilitating the negotiations involved in a Web service composition process. Specifically, the proposed GA with Norm operator performs better than other approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2011.55","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009354","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009137/6009354/06009378.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WebNeg: A Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for Service Negotiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009378/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"WebNeg: A Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for Service Negotiation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009378/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12219255","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WebNeg: A Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for Service Negotiation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4463a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106909S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009137","isNumber":"6009354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009137","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6009354","articleId":"6009378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6009380,"authors":[{"name":"Milinda Pathirage","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Milinda","lastName":"Pathirage","id":"37892339600"},{"name":"Srinath Perera","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinath","lastName":"Perera","id":"37528286400"},{"name":"Indika Kumara","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Indika","lastName":"Kumara","id":"37593648000"},{"name":"Sanjiva Weerawarana","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjiva","lastName":"Weerawarana","id":"37333061000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0842-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4463-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009380","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":826},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Carbon","Runtime","Service oriented architecture","Organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business process re-engineering","cloud computing","middleware","organisational aspects","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitenant architecture","business process execution","cloud computing","economic pay-as-you-go service","cloud middleware","organization business logic","multitenant workflow engine","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-tenancy","Cloud","SOA","Workflows","Business Processes"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing, as a concept, promises cost savings to end-users by letting them outsource their non-critical business functions to a third party in pay-as-you-go style. However, to enable economic pay-as-you-go services, we need Cloud middleware that maximizes sharing and support near zero costs for unused applications. Multi-tenancy, which let multiple tenants (user) to share a single application instance securely, is a key enabler for building such a middleware. On the other hand, Business processes capture Business logic of organizations in an abstract and reusable manner, and hence play a key role in most organizations. This paper presents the design and architecture of a Multi-tenant Workflow engine while discussing in detail potential use cases of such architecture.

There have been several methods of Web service selection and recommendation based on collaborative filtering, but seldom have they considered personalized influence of users and services. In this paper, we present an effective personalized collaborative filtering method for Web service recommendation. A key component of Web service recommendation techniques is computation of similarity measurement of Web services. Different from the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) similarity measurement, we take into account the personalized influence of services when computing similarity measurement between users and personalized influence of services. Based on the similarity measurement model of Web services, we develop an effective Personalized Hybrid Collaborative Filtering (PHCF) technique by integrating personalized user-based algorithm and personalized item-based algorithm. We conduct series of experiments based on real Web service QoS dataset WSRec [11] which contains more than 1.5 millions test results of 150 service users in different countries on 100 publicly available Web services located all over the world. Experimental results show that the method improves accuracy of recommendation of Web services significantly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Web Service Recommendation Method Based on Personalized Collaborative Filtering","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2011.38","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009137/6009354/06009391.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Web Service Recommendation Method Based on Personalized Collaborative Filtering","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009391/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12219268","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Web Service Recommendation Method Based on Personalized Collaborative Filtering","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4463a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080987S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009137","isNumber":"6009354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009137","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6009354","articleId":"6009391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6009395,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanzhe Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Xuanzhe","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539086700"},{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37535668500"},{"name":"Gang Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37274328100"},{"name":"Hong Mei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies, Ministry of Education, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Mei","id":"37272773400"},{"name":"Teng Teng","affiliation":["Kingdee Middleware Company Limited, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Teng","id":"38272128200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0842-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4463-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6009395","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Semantics","Planning","Taxonomy","Programming","Google"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","graphical user interfaces","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven service mashup composition","tag-based semantic annotations","Web 2.0 paradigm","data capabilities","data flows","planning technique","graphical composition user interfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Services Mashups","End-User Programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009395","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2011.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009354","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009137/6009354/06009395.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composing Data-Driven Service Mashups with Tag-Based Semantic Annotations","abstract":"Spurred by Web 2.0 paradigm, there emerge large numbers of service mashups by composing readily accessible data and services.

The core principle is deriving semantic annotations from popular tags, and associating them with programmatic inputs and outputs data. Tag-based semantics promise a quick and simple comprehension of data capabilities. Mashup developers including end-users can intuitively search desired services with tags, and combine several services by means of data flows.

As with most controllers, the design of GANFIS controllers requires proper parameter selection as well as tuning due to variations in the plant or environment. Evolutionary learning has been shown to be feasible to tune these parameters, but there may be some difficulty in selecting the learning factors. Previously, we addressed this problem by designing a fitness function containing both prediction and heuristics for measuring system performance and extending the approach by integrating simulated annealing features for faster convergence. In this paper, we employ a tuning strategy based upon the Hamming distance to select the key convergence parameters of the evolutionary learning algorithm: the cross-over and mutation rates. To study the approach, we compare the case when simulated annealing is applied for constant values; then an adaptive tuned version of the simulated annealing algorithms is applied. Results show that by tuning, the GANFIS controllers produce an overall tracking performance with a lower error trajectory, thus illustrating the feasibility of this additional feature of the GANFIS controller.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2011.6009510","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2011.6009510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009494","pdfPath":"/iel5/5996363/6009494/06009510.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Hamming distance","Convergence","Simulated annealing","Noise","Biological cells","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","evolutionary computation","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","robust control","simulated annealing","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hamming distance tuning","adaptive neural network fuzzy inference controller","evolutionary simulated annealing","robust controller design","GANFIS control","parameter selection","evolutionary learning","fitness function","tuning strategy","adaptive tuned version","tracking performance","error trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["evolutionary computation","heuristics","fuzzy systems","neural networks","Hamming distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the use of Hamming distance tuning for the generalized adaptive neural network fuzzy inference controller with evolutionary simulated annealing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6009510/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6009510/","accessionNumber":"12220600","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of Hamming distance tuning for the generalized adaptive neural network fuzzy inference controller with evolutionary simulated annealing","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"001008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043742S","chronDate":"3-5 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5996363","isNumber":"6009494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5996363","xplore-issue":"6009494","articleId":"6009510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6009566,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Van Hulse","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Van Hulse","id":"37528475400"},{"name":"Taghi M.

The two grade coding structure of the hierarchical genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the ancient problem that when optimize the neural networks' structure, connection weights, threshold at the same time, the efficiency was low. Furthermore, we compare the networks' capability that optimized by the improved hierarchical genetic algorithm with the ones optimized by other algorithm, and prove the algorithm's credibility through the simulation.
