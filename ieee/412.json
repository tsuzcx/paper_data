The varieties and dynamics of spread spectrum based systems such as: frequency hopping, time domain hopping, multi carrier CDMA and the direct sequence spread spectrum technique have complicated and altered the design paradigm [2]. This diversity has confronted designers with the non-trivial task of rapidly responding to the vagaries of the mobile communication business. Complex digital communications signals with broad bandwidth, varying rectified envelope power and a relatively large crest factor have rendered inadequate traditional verification methods based on the use of CW signals [3]. The attendant demands on cost, efficiency and system constraints and the growing use of balanced circuits in broadband wireless applications has increased the need for accurate modeling and characterization of the nonlinear behavior of active devices. Since the input and output terminations of these devices dictate their large signal behavior, complete device characterization including the determination of constant output power contours requires the use of source and load tuning. Furthermore, proper verification entails simulation and test at both software and hardware levels using the same stimuli [2]. This paper offers a comprehensive, automatic tuner based solution suitable for balanced and unbalanced devices driven by WCDMA based signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"54th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4120054/4120055/04120056.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"54th ARFTG Conference Digest","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.1999.327377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.1999.327377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Load and Source Tuning System for Balanced and Unbalanced WCDMA Power Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power amplifiers","Spread spectrum communication","Tuning","Large-scale systems","Personal communication networks","Europe","Technological innovation","Mobile communication","Business communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Dec. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Load and Source Tuning System for Balanced and Unbalanced WCDMA Power Amplifiers","isConference":true,"volume":"36","publicationDate":"Dec. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"2-3 Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Load and Source Tuning System for Balanced and Unbalanced WCDMA Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-36-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02463S","chronDate":"2-3 Dec. 1999","isNumber":"4120055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120054","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4120056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4120067,"authors":[{"name":"Dylan F.

The use of an analog band pass noise source with a notch in the center bandwidth is currently used for this purpose. We present in this paper a novel NPR measurement technique based on a numerical generation of a gaussian noise. This experimental noise generation is similar to the technique used in non linear circuit level or system level simulations using the envelope transient technique. The measurement principle is based on the use of a baseband arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and an upconverter chain from baseband to L or S band. The large signal Noise stimuli drive the amplifier under test. The output signal of the amplifier is downconverted back to baseband and the resulting complex envelope is recorded with a sampling scope and computed for NPR extraction. A comparison of NPR measurements obtained with our method and with the conventional analog noise source technique is presented. Other possible applications of our measurement system are also mentioned and emphasize the capabilities of the proposed characterization tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"June 2000","volume":"37","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Experimental Noise Power Ratio Characterization Method for Multicarrier Microwave Power Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Experimental Noise Power Ratio Characterization Method for Multicarrier Microwave Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-37-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034583S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2000","isNumber":"4120083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120082","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4120087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":4120089,"authors":[{"name":"Paul D.

This has in turn stimulated the development and deployment of spread spectrum systems based on Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA. This paper addresses problems inherent to the design of large signal gain blocks for use in wide-band CDMA systems. Consistent with our previous work we make use of the Envelope Circuit Simulator in Agilent EDA's Microwave Design System, MDS. The large dynamic range of the CDMA power envelope spectrum, expressed in the crest factor, serves to make simulated harmonic load and source tuning attractive for assessing system performance. The input and output immittances seen by the individual gain blocks must be chosen to satisfy the real time function condition. We demonstrate that simulated results using improperly chosen immittances might lead to incorrect interpretation of large signal behavior of the semiconductor devices. The large fluctuation of the CDMA stimulus tries the linearity of the transfer function leading to spectral re-growth. A study of base-band performance (without harmonics) has shown that the Adjacent Channel Power Ratio, ACPR, is primarily dominated by the derivative of the transfer function with respect to the output power level. The use of pre-correction of the overall transfer function has proved to be the most appropriate means to enhance system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327404","publicationTitle":"55th ARFTG Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"55th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4120082/4120083/04120096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Simulation of Large Signal on Chip Amplifier Modules Excited by WCDMA Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120096/","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Simulation of Large Signal on Chip Amplifier Modules Excited by WCDMA Signals","volume":"37","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2000","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Simulation of Large Signal on Chip Amplifier Modules Excited by WCDMA Signals","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-37-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028448S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2000","isNumber":"4120083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120082","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4120096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4120097,"authors":[{"name":"Gerd Vandersteen","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Vandersteen","id":"37273077200"},{"name":"Yves Rolain","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","IMEC MIRA, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Rolain","id":"37273826700"},{"name":"Wendy van Moer","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","IMEC MIRA, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wendy","lastName":"van Moer","id":"37273913600"},{"name":"Jef Verbeeck","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","IMEC MIRA, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jef","lastName":"Verbeeck","id":"37299312800"},{"name":"Johan Schoukens","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","IMEC MIRA, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Schoukens","id":"37273870900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-5686-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-5037-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4120097","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"abstract":"The large number of carriers and the huge number of possible transmitted symbols in an Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation makes it a challenge to estimate the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) in the presence of nonlinear distortion.

As an example, the case of a differential amplifier with reflectionless terminations is considered in detail. The noise figure, effective input temperature, and gains are related to the results of a series of hot-cold measurements, as in the familiar two-port case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"June 2000","volume":"37","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiport Noise Characterization and Differential Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiport Noise Characterization and Differential Amplifiers","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-37-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028734S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2000","isNumber":"4120083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120082","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4120101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4120102,"authors":[{"name":"Donald C.

The open, short, and thru standards do not vary significantly from wafer to wafer, so we also model these standards using ANNs trained with calibrated measurement data chosen from an arbitrary wafer. We assess the accuracy of five OSLT calibrations with varying load terminations using the ANN-modeled standards, and find that they compare favorably (a difference of less than 0.04 in magnitude at most frequencies) to the benchmark multiline TRL calibration over a 66 GHz bandwidth.

It is shown by measurements that the nonlinear behavior of the amplifier does indeed depend on the input signal. This is seen to be true both for AM/AM and AM/PM distortion. The implication is that a traditionally VNA swept CW cannot be used to obtain the AM/AM and AM/PM distortion that will actually take place in the amplifier during real life conditions, and that test signals which closely resembles the signals that will actually be used are necessary. The focus is to present a new possible measurement methodology necessary to target the demands of accurate characterization raised by multiple carrier power amplifiers MCPA:s. We briefly discuss the mechanisms that lies behind this behavior. The test signal selection and creation is discussed, as well as a method of producing highly linear -80 dBc WCDMA signals for ACP testing. Finally we present practical measurement results on AM/AM and AM/PM distortion obtained with swept, pulsed and multi-tone input signals to prove the input signal dependence. Practical results is given for high power narrowband Class AB LDMOS amplifiers intended for the 2.11-2.17GHz WCDMA band and for medium power Class A GaAs FET amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327433","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"56th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4120116/4120117/04120132.pdf","publicationTitle":"56th ARFTG Conference Digest","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Characterization of Multiple Carrier Power Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Characterization of Multiple Carrier Power Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-1 Dec. 2000","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"38","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120132/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Characterization of Multiple Carrier Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Boulder, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-38-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.016793S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","isNumber":"4120117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120116","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4120132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4120135,"authors":[{"name":"Steven H.

Less well known perhaps is the use of the analytic signal in broadband, non-linear modulation analysis. Inter-symbol interference (ISI), Deterministic Jitter, phase noise, and AM-PM conversion are examples of non-linear system impairments whose measurement and analysis are simplified using analytic signal techniques in Hilbert space. Synchronous sampling allows for direct demodulation and extraction of baseband In-phase and Quadrature channels. Its application to measurement of both random and deterministic jitter, phase noise, and AM-PM effects is discussed, as well as calibration methods and other accuracy enhancement techniques. Synchronous sampling is contrasted to conventional waveform recorder timebases: real-time sampling, random equivalent-time sampling, and triggered sweep. Synchronous Sampling uses a phase locked timebase with delay control and carrier extraction to provide a rotating reference frame in Hilbert space, from which the signals are analyzed in three dimensions: I and Q vs. Time or Modulation Frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-1 Dec. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","volume":"38","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous Sampling and Applications to Analytic Signal Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous Sampling and Applications to Analytic Signal Estimation","confLoc":"Boulder, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-38-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031095S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","isNumber":"4120117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120116","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4120135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4120142,"authors":[{"name":"Haruo Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruo","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37085342296"},{"name":"Kensuke Kobayashi","affiliation":["Teratech Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kensuke","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37292760800"},{"name":"Yuuich Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuich","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37365441600"},{"name":"Kouhei Enomoto","affiliation":["Teratech Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouhei","lastName":"Enomoto","id":"37285728000"},{"name":"Hideyuki Kogure","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Kogure","id":"37299450400"},{"name":"Yoshitaka Onaya","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gunma University, Kiryu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshitaka","lastName":"Onaya","id":"37299449600"},{"name":"Masanao Morimura","affiliation":["Advisor to Teratec Corp. #202-570 18th Street West Vancouver, BC, V7V 3V7, Canada"],"firstName":"Masanao","lastName":"Morimura","id":"37443439900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-5686-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-5038-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4120142","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"abstract":"This paper presents explicit analysis of the output error power in wideband sampling systems in the presence of finite aperture time and sampling jitter. Finite aperture time and sampling jitter are crucial for wideband sampling systems to capture high-frequency signals in high precision. Finite aperture time (or finite aperture window) works as a low pass filter and hence it degrades the high-frequency performance of sampling systems while aperture jitter misleads data acquisition timing points, which causes large errors for high-frequency (and hence large slew rate) signal acquisition. In this paper, we discuss their effects explicitly in case that not only finite aperture time and sampling jitter exist individually but also they exist together for almost any aperture window function with jitter of Gaussian distribution. These results are theoretically fundamental, and are useful for designing wideband sampling data acquisition systems. Experimental measurements are being performed to verify our theoretical results and these may be also reported at the conference.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Sampling methods","Jitter","Wideband","Data acquisition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture Time","Aperture Window","Jitter","Sampling","Equivalent-Time Sampling","ADC","Digitizing Oscilloscope"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327443","publicationTitle":"56th ARFTG Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"56th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4120116/4120117/04120142.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2000.327443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Aperture Time and Sampling Jitter Effects in Wideband Data Acquisition Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite Aperture Time and Sampling Jitter Effects in Wideband Data Acquisition Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120142/","isConference":true,"volume":"38","publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-1 Dec. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Aperture Time and Sampling Jitter Effects in Wideband Data Acquisition Systems","confLoc":"Boulder, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-38-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038488S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2000-Dec. 1 2000","isNumber":"4120117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120116","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4120142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4120146,"authors":[{"name":"Dylan F.

Common system modeling approaches, which are dominated by probing signals of at most a multi-tone nature, prove to be inadequate for representing channels with operational bandwidths reaching the multi-GHz range. This shortfall in modeling fidelity is especially the case for higher-order, non-constant envelope modulations that are often needed to meet bandwidth efficiency demands. As a natural consequence, distortion compensation designs based on these models will likewise prove to be less than optimal in their effectiveness. This paper introduces an established nonlinear system identification technique from the mechanical systems field that essentially solves the wideband modeling problem, and in addition provides very unique assessment and design tools for distortion compensation. The technique is a special case of a formal operator series representation for the given nonlinearity with memory, and its construction is based on an extremely accurate baseband time-domain measurement technique-using pseudo-randomly modulated signals - that will also be described. The basic modeling and compensation features of the method will then be provided, followed by two representative high-power amplifier (HPA) applications to illustrate and validate the modeling method. The fidelity evaluation will be performed in the time-domain using a normalized mean-square error (NMSE) waveform metric, and compared with results found for standard block model approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2001.327481","publicationTitle":"58th ARFTG Conference Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"58th ARFTG Conference Digest","pdfPath":"/iel5/4120182/4120183/04120184.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2001.327481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introduction to Polyspectral Modeling and Compensation Techniques for Wideband Communications Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Nov. 2001","displayDocTitle":"Introduction to Polyspectral Modeling and Compensation Techniques for Wideband Communications Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"40","conferenceDate":"29-30 Nov. 2001","htmlLink":"/document/4120184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120184/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introduction to Polyspectral Modeling and Compensation Techniques for Wideband Communications Systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ARFTG-40-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05825S","chronDate":"29-30 Nov. 2001","xplore-pub-id":"4120182","isNumber":"4120183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4120182","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4120183","articleId":"4120184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4120185,"authors":[{"name":"Anding Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, National University of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anding","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37277394200"},{"name":"Tianhai Wang","affiliation":["M/A-Com Boston, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tianhai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068574500"},{"name":"Thomas J.

To obtain a source current with the least amount of low-order harmonics, the duty cycle within a switching period is proportional to the ratio of the instantaneous value of the source voltage to the output voltage. According to the voltage gain analysis, the output voltage can be regulated by adjusting the switching frequency. Small-signal modeling is performed to facilitate the design process. The proposed control scheme features advantages such as higher input power factor and higher regulated output voltage compared to the traditional discontinuous conduction control with a fixed switching frequency and a constant duty cycle. Any well-developed commercial pulsewidth-modulation control integrated circuit can be adopted with only a minor modification.

In particular, the possibility of pairing \"complementary\" metamaterials in order to reduce the dimensions of microwave components is explored for the leaky-wave operation of an open waveguide consisting of a grounded pair of planar layers. In connection with our similar findings in other setups employing such complementary pairings, here we show how the compact resonance at the interface between \"negative\" and \"positive\" materials may also be properly exploited in this context. Choosing materials with low constitutive parameters, moreover, shows to be effective for enhancing the directivity of these components.

The challenges arise from the fact that the incoherent power, which becomes dominant after some distance of wave propagation in the random medium, is difficult to model. In this paper, a statistical wave propagation model (SWAP) is developed for predicting the wave propagation path-loss in foliage. In this analysis, the forest is assumed to be statistically homogeneous along the direction of wave propagation, and the potentially large distance between the transmitter and receiver in the forest is divided into many statistically similar blocks of finite dimension. A fractal-based forest coherent scattering model (FCSM) is used as a foundation for predicting the characteristics of wave interaction with the foliage. By applying FCSM to a representative block of the forest, the statistical input-output field relationship including field attenuation and regeneration (due to scattering), is computed by a Monte Carlo simulation. These precomputed statistical quantities of the forest are then reused for all blocks using a network theory. The overall received power, and hence the path-loss, is estimated by following the coherent and incoherent power through all the forest blocks. Compared to a brute force approach, the computation time is significantly reduced while the prediction accuracy is maintained. Simulation results for path-loss as a function of propagation distance, frequency, and forest density are presented. The model is successfully validated by comparing its predictions against independent propagation measurements through foliage","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.891841","startPage":"958","endPage":"968","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4120229/04120255.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.891841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Physics-Based Statistical Model for Wave Propagation Through Foliage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Predictive models","Particle scattering","Transmitters","Fractals","Accuracy","Computational modeling","Frequency","Power system modeling","Absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","forestry","millimetre wave propagation","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal attenuation","scattering environment","statistical wave propagation model","SWAP","path loss","foliage","fractal-based forest coherent scattering model","FCSM","Monte Carlo simulation","network theory","physics-based statistical model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Propagation path-loss foilage wave attenuation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Physics-Based Statistical Model for Wave Propagation Through Foliage","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4120255/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9357601","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Physics-Based Statistical Model for Wave Propagation Through Foliage","sourcePdf":"55tap03-fwang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087087S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4120229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4120229","articleId":"4120255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4120256,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Genovesi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","Electromagnetic Communication Laboratories, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA","Italian National Research Council, ISTI, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Genovesi","id":"37301022900"},{"name":"Agostino Monorchio","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Agostino","lastName":"Monorchio","id":"37277494100"},{"name":"Raj Mittra","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Communication Laboratories, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Raj","lastName":"Mittra","id":"37281104600"},{"name":"Giuliano Manara","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuliano","lastName":"Manara","id":"37277485200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4120256","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Conductors","Multidimensional systems","Testing","Design optimization","Convergence","Optimization methods","Space charge","Laboratories","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","magnetic devices","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subboundary approach","particle swarm optimization","artificial magnetic conductor","AMC design","electromagnetic optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs)","optimization methods","particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"abstract":"The particle swarm algorithm is a newly introduced method for electromagnetic optimization problems that is based on the observation of swarm intelligence and particle behavior.

This method allows for a better understanding of indoor propagation and hence greatly assists the development of WiFi-like network planning tools. The efficiency of such wireless design tools is strongly impacted by the quality of the coverage predictions which have to be estimated with a limited computational load. The usual approaches are based either on an empirical modeling relying on measurement campaigns or on geometrical optics leading to ray-tracing. While the former approach suffers from a lack of accuracy, the later one needs to balance accuracy with computational load requirements. The new approach proposed herein is based on a finite difference formalism, i.e., the transmission line matrix (TLM). Once the problem is developed in the frequency domain, the linear system thus obtained is solved in two steps: a pre-processing step which consists of an adaptive MR (multigrid) pre-conditioning and a propagation step. The first step computes a MR data structure represented as a binary tree. In the second step the coverage of a point source is obtained by up-and-down propagating through the binary tree.

In addition, an efficient hybrid use of EP, gradient search methods and cluster analysis, as well as a novel hybrid EP-GA algorithm are discussed.

This paper presents recent advances in applying a versatile PSO engine to real-number, binary, single-objective and multiobjective optimizations for antenna designs, with a randomized Newtonian mechanics model developed to describe the swarm behavior. The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned) antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand, in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays.

The basic idea of the method is that since the array factor is related to the element excitations through an inverse Fourier transform, the element excitations can be derived from the array factor through a direct Fourier transform. Starting with an initial set of suitable element excitations the array factor is calculated. After matching the array factor to the prescribed pattern, an updated set of excitations is obtained through a direct Fourier transform performed on the matched array factor. From this updated set, only the samples associated with the aperture are retained, where after a new array factor is calculated. The whole process is repeated until the updated array factor does not violate any longer the pattern requirements. The proposed synthesis method provides significant improvements in terms of performance, computational speed, flexibility, and ease of implementation in software to the methods described in reviewed literature.

It is demonstrated in this paper that traditional band-notched planar monopole antennas exhibit asymmetry in radiation patterns within the notch band such that the attenuation provided by the antenna varies as a function of azimuth angle, which lowers the effective bandwidth of the notch. A GA optimizer, which uses of a weighted sum cost function related to impedance matching and radiation patterns at frequencies within both the wide operating band and narrow notch band, is used to improve the performance of the band-notch planar monopole antenna. A two-dimensional (2-D) matrix chromosome is used in the GA to represent a wide-range on planar element shapes.

Multiobjective optimization is an important tool in the design of such antennas since conflicting goals such as higher gain, increased bandwidth, and size reduction must be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm which permits full volumetric antenna design by combining genetic algorithms with a fast hybrid finite element-boundary integral method. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a full three dimensional antenna design is pursued using concurrent shape, size, metallization as well as dielectric and magnetic material volume optimization. In comparison to previous optimization pursuits, our approach employs a wide-frequency sweep using a single geometry model, thus, enhancing speed, along with several discrete material choices for realizable optimized designs. The developed algorithm can be interpreted as a three dimensional Pareto optimization scheme and provides the designer with several choices among the best antennas, according to design goals and constraints. The final designs are associated with very thin (~0.01lambda) material substrates and yield as much as 15% bandwidth using a 0.1lambda--0.4lambda aperture subject to various gain and bandwidth requirements","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.891551","startPage":"594","endPage":"603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.891551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120233","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4120233/04120275.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimal Antenna Design Based on Volumetric Material Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120275/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimal Antenna Design Based on Volumetric Material Optimization","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4120275/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9357556","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimal Antenna Design Based on Volumetric Material Optimization","sourcePdf":"55tap03-koulouridis-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06176S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4120233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4120233","articleId":"4120275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4120279,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Lou","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Lou","id":"37269907900"},{"name":"Davi Correia","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Davi","lastName":"Correia","id":"38318000300"},{"name":"Jian-Ming Jin","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian-Ming","lastName":"Jin","id":"37280854000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4120279","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Perfectly matched layers","Time domain analysis","Finite element methods","Numerical simulation","Electromagnetic waveguides","Stripline","Antennas and propagation","Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic propagation in absorbing media","Electromagnetic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna theory","electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic waves","finite element analysis","strip lines","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfectly matched layer","PML","time-domain finite-element method","TDFE","numerical simulation","waveguide","stripline","antenna problem","wave propagation","evanescent wave","mesh truncation","wave scattering","radiation problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element analysis","perfectly matched layers (PMLs)"]}],"abstract":"A formulation is presented to implement the second-order perfectly matched layer (PML) in the time-domain finite element (TDFE) simulation of electromagnetic problems.

This paper introduces a parallel distributed computing framework based on the intelligent agent technology that is capable of handling the genetic optimization for diverse CEM problems. The platform core component is the genetic search agent (GSA), a collaborative computational entity that communicates with its peers in order to carry out a genetic optimization scheme. The platform can interface with foreign codes transparently due to its flexible code loading mechanisms, specially designed for CEM applications. The framework is applied to the optimization of a quasi-point matching method with fictitious sources (QPM-FS). The analysis comprises two case studies, involving electromagnetic scattering by: i) a two-layered cylinder; and ii) a cylinder buried in a two-layered earth medium, a problem of practical use in subsurface imaging.

Unfortunately, the successful development of such techniques has been hindered by the large number of independent parameters that must be optimized and the complexity of the calculations needed for the electromagnetic evaluation of large-N arrays. One promising new design methodology for large-N arrays which has recently been introduced is based on properties of a subset of fractal-random arrays called polyfractal arrays. Polyfractal arrays have many embedded self-similar structures, thereby allowing very large and seemingly complex array layouts to be described with only a small set of independent parameters. In addition, by effectively utilizing the self-similarity of polyfractal arrays, a considerable reduction can be achieved in the amount of time required to evaluate the radiation patterns of large-N arrays. This paper introduces a type of nature-based design process that applies a specially formulated genetic algorithm (GA) technique to evolve optimal polyfractal array layouts. The most unique aspect of this optimization technique is a new autopolyploidy-based chromosome expansion that maximizes the efficiency of the GAs. Simple polyfractal geometries are used in the initial stage or first epoch of the optimization because the number of independent parameters is small and the computation times are relatively fast. After the optimization converges for the first epoch, more complicated descriptions of these polyfractal arrays are introduced to provide additional independent parameters for the optimizer as it progresses through later epochs of evolution. This process has been shown to be very effective in creating optimized large-N arrays, the largest example considered here being a 1616-element linear array with a -24.30-dB sidelobe level and a 0.056deg half-power beamwidth","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.891507","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4120233/04120294.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.891507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autopolyploidy-Based Genetic Algorithm for Enhanced Evolution of Linear Polyfractal Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Autopolyploidy-Based Genetic Algorithm for Enhanced Evolution of Linear Polyfractal Arrays","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9357555","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4120294/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autopolyploidy-Based Genetic Algorithm for Enhanced Evolution of Linear Polyfractal Arrays","sourcePdf":"55tap03-petko-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101892S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4120233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4120233","articleId":"4120294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4120296,"authors":[{"name":"Jos Luis Rodriguez","affiliation":["Departamento de Teor\u00eda do Sinal e Comunicaci\u00d3ns, E.T.S.E.

The performances of the boundary conditions are tested based on both mathematical benchmark functions and a real-world electromagnetic problem: the optimization of a 2-D 16-element array antenna. Simulation results are examined from both the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Comparisons show that the unrestricted boundary conditions are more efficient when the global optimum is inside the boundary of the solution space, and the damping boundary condition is more robust and consistent when the global optimum is close to the boundary","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9357575","htmlLink":"/document/4120306/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Boundary Conditions in Particle Swarm Optimization Revisited","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boundary Conditions in Particle Swarm Optimization Revisited","sourcePdf":"55tap03-xu-cr-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059183S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4120233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4120233","articleId":"4120306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4120309,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Shin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4120229/4120309/4120309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Shin Wang was born in May 1981 in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

An equivalent transmission line model is proposed to explain the dual-band operation of the spiraling PIFA. The measurement results show that the former antenna has a 10 dB return loss with bandwidth 140 MHz in the 2.45 GHz frequency band and bandwidth 756 MHz at 5.25 GHz, whereas the latter one has the bandwidth 240 MHz at 2.45 GHz and bandwidth 672 MHz at 5.25 GHz. In addition, omnidirectional radiation patterns are achieved at those operating frequency bands with average antenna gains near 0 dBi.

The model takes the form of an integral equation of the first kind in which the kernel is interpreted as a Green's function. A theoretical investigation of system independence in the presence of error is developed, and two techniques for the theoretical consideration of system independence are examined. Application of these two techniques to concentric spherical systems indicates that spheres with ratios of inner-to-outer radii less than 0.5 contain less than twenty independent parameters in the presence of realistic noise levels. The number of independent parameters deteriorates rapidly as this ratio falls below 0.5. These results suggest that it is not feasible to determine epicardial potentials from torso potentials by using unconstrained solutions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1972.324070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120526","startPage":"276","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4120526/04120531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconstrained Inverse Electrocardiography: Epicardial Potentials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1972","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1972","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained Inverse Electrocardiography: Epicardial Potentials","publicationDate":"July 1972","pubMedId":"5036139","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"BME-19","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained Inverse Electrocardiography: Epicardial Potentials","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-19-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038953S","chronDate":"July  1972","isNumber":"4120526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"55","articleId":"4120531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4120533,"authors":[{"name":"Ian T.

The recordings were made under low-noise conditions with a recording system bandpass extending from dc to 10 kHz. The ECG data were digitized and spectrally analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The spectral analysis included both single ECG cycles and averaged ECG cycles. Slight differences were found between the averaged sternal and axillary ECG spectra in the low-frequency highamplitude range. An overall mean spectrum was produced as a bound for the normal resting male ECG spectrum as encountered in this study. The maximum value of this spectrum occurred at the fundamental (1.22 Hz); it had a -20-dB point at 36 Hz, -40-dB at 105 Hz, and -60-dB at 300 Hz. To investigate the effects of band-limiting on the ECG, an ideal digital filter was implemented using the FFT. It was found that waveform notching is caused by frequencies over a wide passband, waveform amplitude information extends only to 200 Hz, and waveform duration information lies below 60 Hz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4120661/04120672.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1973.324231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1973.324231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectral Analysis of the Normal Resting Electrocardiogram","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Electrocardiography","Bandwidth","Laboratories","Space vehicles","Space technology","Frequency","Electrodes","Differential amplifiers","Cardiology"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Analog-Digital Conversion","Computers","Electrocardiography","Fourier Analysis","Humans","Male","Spectrum Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1973","displayDocTitle":"A Spectral Analysis of the Normal Resting Electrocardiogram","volume":"BME-20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1973","pubMedId":"4727424","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectral Analysis of the Normal Resting Electrocardiogram","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-20-n5-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030358S","chronDate":"Sept.  1973","isNumber":"4120661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"81","articleId":"4120672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4120681,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper treats locomotion dynamics relative to planar motion under an assumption that leg mass can be ignored in comparison to body mass. Thus the hypothetical biped possesses one rotational degree of freedom and two translational degrees, leading to a sixth-order system of nonlinear differential equations. These equations are linearized and feedback control laws are then derived to produce the desired stable forward motion. The feedback laws proposed involve a combination of continuous and discrete concepts to produce both step length and step period control as well as control of body attitude and altitude. The applicability of the control laws to the nonlinear system in the presence of large disturbances is verified by computer simulation. Hopefully, the results presented are significant relative to control processes arising in lower extremity prostheses and orthoses as well as to the design of biped robots.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4120734/04120739.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1974.324294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1974.324294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120734","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Dynamic Stability of Biped Locomotion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Feedback control","Stability analysis","Mathematical model","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Leg","Differential equations","Nonlinear equations","Attitude control","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Feedback","Leg","Locomotion","Mathematics","Models, Biological"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1974","displayDocTitle":"On the Dynamic Stability of Biped Locomotion","volume":"BME-21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1974","pubMedId":"4818794","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Dynamic Stability of Biped Locomotion","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-21-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029309S","chronDate":"March  1974","isNumber":"4120734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"163","articleId":"4120739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4120758,"authors":[{"name":"William R.

For the CW Doppler flowmeter, the power spectral density function is computed, and its significance is emphasized: measurement of blood flow velocity corresponds to estimation of the average frequency of the Doppler power spectrum.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4120754/04120758.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1974.324381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1974.324381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical Analysis of the CW Doppler Ultrasonic Flowmeter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Fluid flow measurement","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Blood flow","Scattering","Frequency estimation","Stochastic processes","Random processes","Density functional theory","Density measurement"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Blood Flow Velocity","Mathematics","Models, Biological","Rheology","Ultrasonics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1974","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Analysis of the CW Doppler Ultrasonic Flowmeter","volume":"BME-21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1974","pubMedId":"4277736","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Analysis of the CW Doppler Ultrasonic Flowmeter","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-21-n3-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032329S","chronDate":"May  1974","isNumber":"4120754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"125","articleId":"4120758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4120759,"authors":[{"name":"Lewis J.

Photoengraved microelectrodes are utilized to obtain high dimensional precision, small size, and extremely low capacitive coupling between electrodes. The interelectrode capacitance is less than 0.01 pf. The integrated input devices (JFET's) reduce the impedance levels on the recording channels to less than 500 ohms, virtually eliminating crosstalk and stray noise pickup from the system. The n-channel JFET's operate as source-followers from a common 2.5 volt drain supply and have input impedances greater than 100 megohms at 1 kHz. A simple external preamplifier ensures stable operation and easy interfacing with conventional recording and display equipment. Special considerations in the design of low-noise completely integrated input stages for use with metal microelectrodes are discussed in detail. As a result of the low interelectrode coupling in this structure, simultaneous recording and stimulation from closely adjacent areas of brain should be possible with virtually no stimulus artifact.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4120889/04120899.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1975.324562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1975.324562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4120889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4120899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Capacitance Multielectrode Probe for Use in Extracellular Neurophysiology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Extracellular","Neurophysiology","Microelectrodes","Impedance","Crosstalk","Electrodes","Capacitance","Noise reduction","Noise level"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electrodes","Electronics, Medical","Neurophysiology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4120899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1975","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1975","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Capacitance Multielectrode Probe for Use in Extracellular Neurophysiology","volume":"BME-22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1975","pubMedId":"1116854","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Capacitance Multielectrode Probe for Use in Extracellular Neurophysiology","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-22-n3-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064613S","chronDate":"May  1975","isNumber":"4120889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"116","articleId":"4120899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4120972,"authors":[{"name":"H.

There is not, however, an adequate model for nerve excitation which allows one to compute the threshold of a nerve fiber for pulses of finite duration using electrodes that are not in direct contact with the fiber. This paper considers this problem and presents a model of the electrical properties of myelinated nerve which describes the time course of events following stimulus application up to the initiation of the action potential. The time-varying current and potential at all nodes can be computed from the model, and the strength-duration curve can be determined for arbitrary electrode geometries, although only the case of a monopolar electrode is considered in this paper. It is shown that even when the stimulus is a constant-current pulse, the membrane current at the nodes varies considerably with time. The strength-duration curve calculated from the model is consistent with previously published experimental data, and the model provides a quantitative relationship between threshold and fiber diameter which shows there is less selectivity among fibers of large diameter than those of small diameter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Model for Excitation of Myelinated Nerve","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1976.324593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121048/04121058.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1976.324593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1976","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Model for Excitation of Myelinated Nerve","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-23","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"July 1976","pubMedId":"1278925","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Model for Excitation of Myelinated Nerve","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-23-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025652S","chronDate":"July  1976","isNumber":"4121048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"577","articleId":"4121058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4121062,"authors":[{"name":"Maurice Klee","affiliation":["Mathematical Research Branch, National Institute of Arthritis, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Maurice","lastName":"Klee","id":"37285830000"},{"name":"Robert Plonsey","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Plonsey","id":"37300717900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4121062","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121062","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Extracellular","Cells (biology)","Biomembranes","Biological cells","Boundary conditions","Conductivity","Arthritis","Biochemistry"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cell Physiology","Cells","Electric Stimulation","Electrophysiology","Models, Biological"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.1976.324597","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121048/04121062.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1976.324597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stimulation of Spheroidal Cells - The Role of Cell Shape","abstract":"The behavior of spheroidal cells in an applied uniform field is examined in order to gain insight into the role of cell shape in the electrical activity of biological cells.

Pulses of ultrasound (8 MHz \u00b13 MHz) are transmitted through the breast in a coronal plane from a plurality of directions. The received signal is processed for arrival time and for changes in amplitude. The measured values for arrival time and attenuation are used in a convolution-back projection reconstruction algorithm to obtain estimates of the two-dimensional distribution of acoustic speed and attenuation within the scanned planes of the breast. Over 1000 images in breasts of approximately 150 patients have been scanned of whom 30 had biopsy proven cancer. Some common characteristics of the reconstructed images which are associated with cancer are 1) increased speed relative to the embedding tissue associated with 2) decreased attenuation in central region of the lesion usually with 3) a ring of higher attenuation at the border of the lesion. Current estimates of sensitivity and specificity of this system for cancer are approaching those of X-ray mammography techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121179/","volume":"BME-28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","pubMedId":"7287021","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Clinical Imaging with Transmissive Ultrasonic Computerized Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clinical Imaging with Transmissive Ultrasonic Computerized Tomography","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043607S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"4121165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"211","articleId":"4121179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121181,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen J.

For the special case of continuous-wave (CW) insonification, exact inversion formulas have recently been reported for recovering an unknown scattering parameter from scattering measurements. In this work, exact solutions, or inversion formulas, are obtained for the general case of arbitrary broad-band insonification where the incident wave is assumed to be a spherically diverging broad-bandwidth pulse of arbitrary shape. Solutions are derived under the assumption that the scattering is sufficiently weak for the Born approximation to hold. Exact inversion formulas are obtained for three aperture geometries: a plane, cylindrical, or spherical recording surface enclosing the scattering region. Under most practical conditions, the process of back projection and coherent summation over spherical surfaces in image space, without prior filtering, is shown to provide a close approximation to the exact inversion procedure. Finally, in the case of the spherical geometry, the mathematical equivalence between the three-dimensional inverse Radon transform and the far-field approximation to the exact solution is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","volume":"BME-28","issue":"2","pubMedId":"7287023","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic Reflectivity Imaging in Three Dimensions: Exact Inverse Scattering Solutions for Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Apertures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic Reflectivity Imaging in Three Dimensions: Exact Inverse Scattering Solutions for Plane, Cylindrical, and Spherical Apertures","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n2-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083255S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"4121165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"232","articleId":"4121181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4121195,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Kuperstein","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kuperstein","id":"37295037100"},{"name":"Douglas A.

This paper describes results of a simulation study that evaluated alternative techniques for estimating the spectrum of the ABR signal and of the background EEG. The effects of residual noise in the average signal, the number of responses in the average, and the use of smoothing windows were considered. Spectra of human ABR's were also obtained. The spectral energy decreases with frequency to 2 kHz and seems to flatten above 2 kHz. The ABR signal spectrum is limited to below approximately 1.5 kHz. There are three main components: a low-frequency component around 100 Hz, a midfrequency component around 500 Hz, and a high-frequency component at 1000 Hz. Narrow-band filtering suggests that the midfrequency component is primarily associated with Jewett wave V, while the high-frequency component is primarily associated with the early Jewett waves. These two components are probably the most important for determining the latencies of waves. The low-frequency component appears to correspond to a slow wave on which the Jewett waves are superimposed.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1981.324801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1981.324801","startPage":"334","endPage":"341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121209/04121215.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectra of Auditory Brainstem Responses and Spontaneous EEG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","displayDocTitle":"Spectra of Auditory Brainstem Responses and Spontaneous EEG","publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","volume":"BME-28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"7287033","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121215/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectra of Auditory Brainstem Responses and Spontaneous EEG","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058144S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"4121209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4121215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121217,"authors":[{"name":"Piet Bergveld","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Twente Technical University, Enschede, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Piet","lastName":"Bergveld","id":"37301312000"},{"name":"Wietze J.

The cascaded source follower can be added to existing amplifiers or incorporated into new amplifier design with relatively little difficulty.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1981.324805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1981.324805","startPage":"358","endPage":"359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121209/04121219.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Circuit to Reduce the Input Capacitance of Microelectrode Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Circuit to Reduce the Input Capacitance of Microelectrode Amplifiers","publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","volume":"BME-28","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"7287036","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121219/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Circuit to Reduce the Input Capacitance of Microelectrode Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028023S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"4121209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4121219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121230,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Van Den Honert","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA","Central Research Laboratories, 3M Company, Saint Paul, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Van Den Honert","id":"37294807200"},{"name":"J.

Light levels for ophthalmoscopy (20 \u03bcW/cm2 at the retina) are at least two orders of magnitude below those in current use. \u03bc focused laser bearn forms a flying spot, moved physically by scanning mirrors. This allows a 20 \u03bcm or smaller resolution element, with only a 0.9 mm diameter area of the patient's pupil used for the entering beam. The remaining pupillary area forms the exit pupil-a critical inversion of the division of pupils necessary for systems using conventional imaging. It is this inversion which allows the low light level and the unique measurement capabilities. We discuss the constraints imposed by viewing the inside of a spheroid through a small hole in its wall, and our solutions-both optical and electronic-to these problems.

Previous investigators have shown that the frequency compression is related to the decreasing conduction velocity of the muscle fibers. It is proposed that the frequency compression may be tracked by obtaining a continuous estimate of a characteristic frequency of the spectrum, such as the mean and median, or the ratio of low-frequency components to high-frequency components of the spectrum. A theoretical analysis was performed to investigate the restrictions in estimating the three parameters, as well as their sensitivity to the conduction velocity. The ratio parameter was found to be most sensitive to conduction velocity, but was the least reliable of the three. The median frequency was the least sensitive to noise. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, the median frequency is the preferred parameter. A technique is described which determines an unbiased consistent estimate of the median frequency. The technique may be readily implemented in analog hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121265/","volume":"BME-28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1981","pubMedId":"7275132","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Parameters of the Myoelectric Signal as a Measure of Muscle Conduction Velocity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Parameters of the Myoelectric Signal as a Measure of Muscle Conduction Velocity","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n7-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043025S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"4121257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"384","articleId":"4121265","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121295,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

The voltage dependency of the membrane conductances was modeled by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. A major assumption of the model is that the pre-and postjunctional membranes are excitable. The bulk electrical properties (capacitance, conductivity, etc.) of the junctional membranes may be the same as those of the surface membranes. We showed that a modification of the dynamics of the fast sodium channel gates of the junctional membranes (controlled by the m and h parameters) can be employed as a mechanism to secure propagation of an impulse. The propagation velocity was determined primarily by the dynamics of the junctional membranes, and was essentially independent of the rate of rise of the surface units. Propagation at a constant velocity occurred when the electric field model was expanded to a chain of six cells. Thus, the electric field model, based on closely apposed and excitable junctional membranes, could account for propagation in cardiac muscle, and may apply under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121286/04121295.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1981.324756","startPage":"655","endPage":"661","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1981.324756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1981","displayDocTitle":"Alteration in Sodium Channel Gate Kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Applied to an Electric Field Model for Interaction Between Excitable Cells","volume":"BME-28","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1981","pubMedId":"6274786","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alteration in Sodium Channel Gate Kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Applied to an Electric Field Model for Interaction Between Excitable Cells","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-28-n9-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035676S","chronDate":"Sept.  1981","isNumber":"4121286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4121295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4121309,"authors":[{"name":"Toino Katila","affiliation":["Department of Technical Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Toino","lastName":"Katila","id":"37297638100"},{"name":"Roman Maniewski","affiliation":["Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Maniewski","id":"37297631600"},{"name":"Timo Tuomisto","affiliation":["Department of Technical Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Tuomisto","id":"37297632500"},{"name":"Timo Varpula","affiliation":["Department of Technical Physics, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Varpula","id":"37297635000"},{"name":"Pentti Siltanen","affiliation":["Cardiovascular Laboratory, Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Pentti","lastName":"Siltanen","id":"37297628800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4121309","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":145},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic variables measurement","Magnetic susceptibility","Thorax","Heart","Plethysmography","Magnetometers","Magnetic field measurement","Muscles","Blood flow","Abdomen"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Cardiac Volume","Cardiography, Impedance","Cardiography, Impedance","Heart","Humans","Magnetics","Male","Models, Biological","Plethysmography, Impedance","Stroke Volume"]}],"abstract":"Magnetic susceptibility plethysmography (MSPG) is a non-invasive technique for detecting changes in the total cardiac volume. The MSPG signal is observed with a sensitive magnetometer when an external magnetic field is applied to the thorax. The signal is due to the differences in magnetic susceptibilities of intracardiac blood, heart muscle, and surrounding tissues. In this work the spatial distribution of the MSPG signal across the chest of normal subjects is presented. The ventricular ejection of blood was clearly exhibited in signals measured above the heart. Relatively large MSPG signals were also observed on the upper and lower thorax during the ventricular ejection, related to the blood flow in the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta, respectively tively. The temporal behavior of the MSPG is compared with the results obtained from existing clinical methods. The origin of the MSPG signal is analyzed theoretically.

However, both the nature of biological signals and the use of micro-or minicomputers in such applications imply the need for simple, low-order, and fast differentiation methods, rather than sophisticated high-order algorithms. Responding to this need, we investigate here the low-pass first- and second-order digital differentiation from both theoretical and practical points of view, in order to achieve good and simple algorithms. In contrast with most of the research works previously done in this field, whose main aim was to achieve better accuracy even in the cost of using quite high-order algorithms, we restrict ourselves in this study only to low orders, being interested not only in the accuracy achieved, but also in the simplicity of the algorithm. After discussing the theoretical considerations concerning our optimum low-pass differentiation filters, we present our simple low-order filters and show them to be not only very convenient for use, but also almost optimum.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1982.324861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121322/04121327.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1982.324861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Low-Pass Differentiation for Biological Signal Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Low-Pass Differentiation for Biological Signal Processing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1982","volume":"BME-29","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1982","pubMedId":"6897393","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Low-Pass Differentiation for Biological Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-29-n10-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022094S","chronDate":"Oct.  1982","isNumber":"4121322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"162","articleId":"4121327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4121348,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce C.

It consists of a multichannel (via one electrode) myoelectric signal recording procedure, a data compression algorithm, a digital filtering algorithm, and a hybrid visual-computer decomposition scheme. The algorithms have been implemented on a PDP 11/34 computer. Of the four major segments of the technique, the decomposition scheme is by far the most involved. The decomposition algorithm uses a-sophisticated template matching routine and details of the firing statistics of the motor units to identify motor unit action potentials in the myoelectric signal, even when they are super-imposed with other motor unit action potentials. In general, the algorithms of the decomposition scheme do not run automatically. They require input from the human operator to maintain reliability and accuracy during a decomposition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Procedure for Decomposing the Myoelectric Signal Into Its Constituent Action Potentials - Part I: Technique, Theory, and Implementation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1982.324881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121376/04121379.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1982.324881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1982","displayDocTitle":"A Procedure for Decomposing the Myoelectric Signal Into Its Constituent Action Potentials - Part I: Technique, Theory, and Implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-29","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 1982","pubMedId":"7084948","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Procedure for Decomposing the Myoelectric Signal Into Its Constituent Action Potentials - Part I: Technique, Theory, and Implementation","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-29-n3-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040978S","chronDate":"March  1982","isNumber":"4121376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"218","articleId":"4121379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4121380,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald S.

Consequently, the realization of a practical system with the possibility of near-term application requires simultaneous and coordinated work by personnel in a number of normally unrelated areas of medicine and engineering.

A new system for aiding blind orientation, described here, is now advancing beyond the experimental stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121393/04121402.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1982.324945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1982.324945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Developments in Mobility and Orientation Aids for the Blind","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Sonar detection","Sensory aids","Radar applications","Sonar applications","Transistors","Radar detection","Prosthetics","Orthotics","Arm"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Audiovisual Aids","Blindness","Electronics, Medical","Humans","Locomotion","Self-Help Devices","Sensory Aids","Travel","Ultrasonics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1982","displayDocTitle":"New Developments in Mobility and Orientation Aids for the Blind","volume":"BME-29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1982","pubMedId":"6175559","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Developments in Mobility and Orientation Aids for the Blind","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-29-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03781S","chronDate":"April  1982","isNumber":"4121393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"62","articleId":"4121402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4121415,"authors":[{"name":"Per Ola Borjesson","affiliation":["Facit AB, Svangsta, Sweden"],"firstName":"Per Ola","lastName":"Borjesson","id":"37269409600"},{"name":"Olle Pahlm","affiliation":["Department of Clinical Physiology, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Olle","lastName":"Pahlm","id":"37294824300"},{"name":"Leif Sornmo","affiliation":["Division of Telecommunication Theory, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Sornmo","id":"37270887800"},{"name":"Mats-Erik Nygards","affiliation":["Department of Medical Informatics, Link\u00f6ping University, Linkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats-Erik","lastName":"Nygards","id":"37294821700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4121415","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum a posteriori estimation","Mathematical model","Filters","Heart","Detectors","Electrocardiography","Morphology","Gaussian noise","Random variables","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electricity","Electrocardiography","Filtration","Humans","Mathematics","Models, Theoretical"]}],"abstract":"A mathematical model for the occurrence of nonoverlapping pulse-shaped waveforms corrupted with colored Gaussian noise is considered for the purpose of QRS detection. The number of waveforms, the arrival times, amplitudes, and widths are regarded as random variables. The joint MAP estimation of all the unknown quantities consists of linear filtering followed by an optimization procedure. A class of filters is introduced which is easy to implement. The mismatching obtained by using this class for detection of model QRS complexes is investigated. The optimization procedure is time-consuming and is modified so that a threshold test is obtained. The model formulation with nonoverlapping waveforms leads to an \"eye-closing\" procedure covering a segment before as well as after an accepted event.

Such signals collected from a simulated amputee are synergistically generated to produce discrete lower arm movements. The purpose of this study is to utilize these signals to control an electrically driven prosthetic or orthotic arm with minimum extra mental effort on the part of the subject. The results show very good separability of classes of movements when a learning pattern classification scheme is used, and a superposition principle seems to hold which may provide a means of decomposition of any composite motion to the six basic primitive motions, e.g., humeral rotation in and out, elbow flexion and extension, and wrist pronation and supination. Since no synergy was detected for the hand movements, different inputs have to be provided for a grip. The method described is not limited by the location of the electrodes. For amputees with shorter stumps, synergistic signals could be obtained from the shoulder muscles. However, the presentation in this paper is limited to bicep-tricep signal classification only.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121432/04121436.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1982.324954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1982.324954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMG Pattern Analysis and Classification for a Prosthetic Arm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Pattern analysis","Prosthetics","Pattern classification","Statistical analysis","Signal generators","Orthotics","Elbow","Wrist","Electrodes"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Amputation","Arm","Electromyography","Electronics, Medical","Humans","Microcomputers","Muscles","Prostheses and Implants","Prosthesis Design","Statistics as Topic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1982","displayDocTitle":"EMG Pattern Analysis and Classification for a Prosthetic Arm","volume":"BME-29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1982","pubMedId":"7106790","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMG Pattern Analysis and Classification for a Prosthetic Arm","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-29-n6-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03199S","chronDate":"June  1982","isNumber":"4121432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"149","articleId":"4121436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4121443,"authors":[{"name":"Earl R.

This method, called time-sequenced adaptive filtering, is applied to the enhancement of abdominally derived fetal electrocardiograms against background muscle noise. It is shown that substantial improvement in terms of signal distortion is obtained when time-sequenced filtering, rather than conventional time-invariant filtering, is employed. The method requires two or more abdominal channels containing correlated signal components, but uncorrelated muscle noise components. The location of the fetal pulses in time must be estimated in order to synchronize the filter's time-varying impulse response to the fetal cardiac cycle.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1982.324973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121432/04121443.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1982.324973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fetal Electrocardiogram Enhancement by Time-Sequenced Adaptive Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121443/","displayDocTitle":"Fetal Electrocardiogram Enhancement by Time-Sequenced Adaptive Filtering","volume":"BME-29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1982","pubMedId":"7106797","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fetal Electrocardiogram Enhancement by Time-Sequenced Adaptive Filtering","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-29-n6-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054393S","chronDate":"June  1982","isNumber":"4121432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"115","articleId":"4121443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4121458,"authors":[{"name":"Otto Rompelman","affiliation":["Information Theory Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Rompelman","id":"37293892500"},{"name":"Jos B.I.M.

Multivariate autoregression models were derived for each function; discrimination was performed using a multiple-model hypothesis detection technique. This approach extends the work of Graupe and Cline [1] by including spatial correlations and by using a more generalized detection philosophy, based on analysis of the time history of all limb function probabilities. These probabilities are the sufficient statistics for the problem if the EMG data are stationary Gauss-Markov processes. Experimental results on-normal subjects are presented which demonstrate the advantages of using the spatial and time correlation of the signals.

An adaptive algorithm based upon a minimum variance control law is presented. A more advanced algorithm obtained by augmenting the performance measure to include the rate of charge of the control signal is also presented. An autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model, representing the dynamics of the system, and a recursive least-squares parameter estimation technique are used for both algorithms. A series of experiments was performed in dogs, utilizing an electronically activated drug infuser. Stable control was achieved, even when the circulatory state of the animal underwent major changes, using either algorithm. On the basis of theoretical considerations and experimental results, we expect that these adaptive controllers will significantly improve the performance of drug infusion systems in clinical applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"March 1983","pubMedId":"6862492","volume":"BME-30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of Blood Pressure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of Blood Pressure","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-30-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028689S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"4121590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4121596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121614,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory S.

The method employs a matched filter to detect the ABR buried in the EEG. The matched filter system can also be used to predict wave V latency, which is useful in testing for hearing loss. By using a matched filter derived from an ABR obtained at a high-stimulus level, it is possible to calculate wave V latency at lower intensity levels much faster. Excellent correlation is seen between wave V latencies calculated in this manner, and those obtained after significant amounts of averaging. Because of this, the matched filter system can reduce the amount of time required for a hearing loss test from 20-30 min to approximately 5-10 min with no significant degradation in results.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1983.325036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1983.325036","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121655/04121658.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Detection of Auditory Evoked Responses Using a Matched Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1983","displayDocTitle":"The Detection of Auditory Evoked Responses Using a Matched Filter","publicationDate":"July 1983","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","volume":"BME-30","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"6618503","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121658/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Detection of Auditory Evoked Responses Using a Matched Filter","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-30-n7-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04402S","chronDate":"July  1983","isNumber":"4121655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4121658","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4121659,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Threshold difference increased with decreasing pulse width, the greatest effects evident for pulses less than 100 \u03bcs. Biphasic stimulation with no delay between pulses provided greater threshold separation than monophasic stimulation or biphasic stimulation with delay. Animal experiments, in which recruitment in a nerve trunk composed of mixed diameter nerve fibers was examined, showed a decrease in recruitment slope with a decrease in pulse width and with the use of a biphasic, zero delay pulse. These results were examined through muscle force measurements using both a metal loop electrode encircling the nerve trunk and a nerve cuff electrode, i. e., a loop electrode in an insulating tube.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1983.325041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121655/04121663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1983.325041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121655","startPage":"407","endPage":"414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Stimulus Parameters on the Recruitment Characteristics of Direct Nerve Stimulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Stimulus Parameters on the Recruitment Characteristics of Direct Nerve Stimulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-30","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1983","pubMedId":"6604691","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Stimulus Parameters on the Recruitment Characteristics of Direct Nerve Stimulation","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-30-n7-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023556S","chronDate":"July  1983","isNumber":"4121655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"198","articleId":"4121663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4121676,"authors":[{"name":"Olaf T.

Finally, an analysis is presented of current techniques for improving ultrasound image quality using phased array methods including phase compensation, spatial compounding, frequency compounding, and parallel processing.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1983.325149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121671/04121676.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1983.325149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Steering with Linear Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121676/","displayDocTitle":"Beam Steering with Linear Arrays","volume":"BME-30","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","pubMedId":"6629379","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Steering with Linear Arrays","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-30-n8-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037196S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"4121671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"189","articleId":"4121676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4121677,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

A basic introduction to the problems and paradoxes of transducer design is given. After introducing the piezoelectric equations and discussing important transducer material such as lead zirconate titanate and polyvinylidene difluoride, the techniques for modeling the electromechanical impulse response are reviewed. Quarter-wave matching and short pulse techniques are discussed. The prediction of the ultrasound field of plane, spherical, and conical transducers is reviewed with emphasis on the spatio-temporal impulse response technique. Finally, the use of the above approaches is illustrated in a very practical fashion for three interesting transducer geometries: 1) a split aperture device with two focal lengths, 2) a five-element annular array, and 3) a 37.5 degree conical/annular array hybrid transducer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound Transducers for Pulse-Echo Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1983.325150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121671/04121677.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1983.325150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound Transducers for Pulse-Echo Medical Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-30","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","pubMedId":"6629380","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound Transducers for Pulse-Echo Medical Imaging","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-30-n8-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097704S","chronDate":"Aug.  1983","isNumber":"4121671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"159","articleId":"4121677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4121712,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Gee","affiliation":["Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA","University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Gee","id":"37287612400"},{"name":"Shung-Wu Lee","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shung-Wu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293438500"},{"name":"Nelson K.

The array, which was submerged in deionized water to reduce its size and to provide a better impedance match to a high dielectric medium representative of human tissues, consisted of four titanium dioxide loaded horn antennas with apertures of 2.0 x 1.4 cm and a feed network with weighted phase shifts, Power radiation pattern measurements were made in planes ranging from 7.6 to 10.2 cm from the array to determine the focusing characteristics and beam spot size. Due to high attenuation in the medium, planes beyond 10.2 cm were not considered. The half-power beamwidth (HPBW) measured at the focal point was approximately 1.3 cm.

Physical placement of electrodes has enabled improved discrimination of the biopotential of interest (such as the ECG) from unwanted biopotentials (such as the EMG). Understanding that the major motion artifact in ECG recording arises from the skin and not the electrode has resulted in techniques that reduce this artifact, such as skin abrasion and mechanical stabilization. However, skin abrasion makes the skin more subject to irritation, so mild gels are required. The development of the floating silver/silver chloride electrode has eliminated motion artifact and noise caused by the electrode. The development of the driven-right-leg circuit has greatly reduced interference due to power lines.

The scattering function is the sum of the variations in compressibility and the variations in density, the latter being weighted by the cosine of the scattering angle. An analogous Fourier transform relation describes the average scattered intensity in terms of the correlation of the scattering function between points in a scattering volume. These Fourier transforms permit different scattering measurements to be related via trajectories in wavespace. Backscatter measurements made on blood, eye, liver, spleen, brain, and heart show the feasibility of differentiating tissues and determining spacing. Ultrasonic measurements of random medium model properties have demonstrated that average differential scattering cross sections per unit volume can be found accurately and precisely, and that scattering cross sections per unit volume can be used to make quantitative statements about changes in scattering properties. Measurements of calf liver ultrasonic differential and total scattering cross sections show that calf liver is a weak scatterer with nearly one-half of the total scattered power occurring between scattering angles of 25-45\u00b0. Measurements of scattering by fixed pig and human liver show qualitative agreement with predictions of scattering from architecture observed optically. Results presently accumulated indicate the promise of scattering measurements for tissue characterization, but extensive additional in vitro and in vivo development is required before their clinical utility for diagnosis is known.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1984.325254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121761/04121788.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"893","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1984.325254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Tissue Characterization from Ultrasonic Scattering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Tissue Characterization from Ultrasonic Scattering","volume":"BME-31","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","pubMedId":"6396214","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Tissue Characterization from Ultrasonic Scattering","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-31-n12-27.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052711S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"4121761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"56","articleId":"4121788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4121801,"authors":[{"name":"Erwin S.

The time-discrete nature of the Doppler signals affects the procedure to estimate the average frequency of the Doppler signal. Based on computer simulation studies it is demonstrated that a time-discrete frequency estimator based on either the density of zero-crossings or the time average of the instantaneous frequency exhibit a large relative error under poor signal-to-noise conditions or in the case of relatively wide band signals. Especially, the frequency estimator based on the instantaneous frequency functions poorly for average Doppler frequencies close to the Nyquist frequency. However, restricting the detected instantaneous frequency to a specific interval around its average improves the estimator performance considerably, while it allows tracking of center frequencies beyond the Nyquist frequency.

It is an application of the authors' earlier work which derived a solution method by means of an integral equation under a generalized configuration of geometry and conductivity of the torso. Based on prior geometry information, the human torso region is discretized into a series offinite elements and, then, electric fields are computed when a set of linearly independent functions chosen as a basis is imposed on the epicardial surface. The set of these forward solutions defines the forward transfer coefficients which relate epicardial to body surface potentials. By the use of the forward transfer coefficients, a constrained least-squares estimate of the epicardial potential distribution can be obtained from measured body surface potentials. The solution method is examined through numerical experiments carried out for a realistic model of the human torso. It is demonstrated that the rapid decrease in voltage far from the heart generator makes this inverse problem ill conditioned and, as a result, the accuracy of the inverse epicardial potentials calculated depends greatly upon both the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of lead points in measuring the body surface potentials.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1984.325305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121902/04121909.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1984.325305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of the Finite Element Method to Determine Epicardial from Body Surface Potentials Under a Realistic Torso Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4121909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121909/","displayDocTitle":"Use of the Finite Element Method to Determine Epicardial from Body Surface Potentials Under a Realistic Torso Model","volume":"BME-31","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","pubMedId":"6490038","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of the Finite Element Method to Determine Epicardial from Body Surface Potentials Under a Realistic Torso Model","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-31-n9-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051716S","chronDate":"Sept.  1984","isNumber":"4121902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"62","articleId":"4121909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4121926,"authors":[{"name":"William D.

In order to reduce the large number of computations involved in the digital filtering that are necessary, the desired filter spectrum was defined periodically. Making use of the property that the spectrum period is 50 Hz, the spectrum can be realized with a considerably reduced number of impulse response coefficients. This, in combination with the necessary impulse response symmetry, leads to a reduction in the number of multiplications per output sample by a factor of 10. A suitable impulse response is designed with a pass-band ripple of less than 0.5 dB and a high stop-band attenuation. The applicability is demonstrated by applying the filtering to exercise electrocardiograms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1060","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1985.325514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1985.325514","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4121985/04121994.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4121985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Removal of Base-Line Wander and Power-Line Interference from the ECG by an Efficient FIR Filter with a Reduced Number of Taps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4121994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Removal of Base-Line Wander and Power-Line Interference from the ECG by an Efficient FIR Filter with a Reduced Number of Taps","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","pubMedId":"4077083","volume":"BME-32","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Removal of Base-Line Wander and Power-Line Interference from the ECG by an Efficient FIR Filter with a Reduced Number of Taps","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-32-n12-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041348S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4121985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"220","articleId":"4121994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4122023,"authors":[{"name":"Tadakuni Murai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Toyama University, Takaoka, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadakuni","lastName":"Murai","id":"37287616600"},{"name":"Yukio Kagawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Toyama University, Takaoka, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukio","lastName":"Kagawa","id":"37295736200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4122023","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":193,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":901},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Finite element methods","Surface impedance","Conductivity","X-ray imaging","Impedance measurement","Pollution measurement","Computational modeling","Iterative methods","Plethysmography"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electric Conductivity","Mathematics","Models, Theoretical","Plethysmography, Impedance","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122023","abstract":"A simulation study of electrical impedance computed tomography is presented.

This interactive system was tested in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

Additional efforts concerned with the actual demonstration of these concepts on dogs have further supported the role of adaptive control for blood pressure regulation.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"10","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122153","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122153/04122157.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Blood pressure","Pressure control","Feedback","Drugs","Transfer functions","Steady-state","Computer simulation","Uncertainty","Delay effects"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Computers","Dogs","Feedback","Ferricyanides","Hypertension","Mathematics","Nitroprusside","Nitroprusside"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Model Adaptive Control Procedure for Blood Pressure Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122157/","volume":"BME-33","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"3940985","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Model Adaptive Control Procedure for Blood Pressure Control","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n1-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028884S","chronDate":"Jan.  1986","isNumber":"4122153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4122157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4122176,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce C.

The image of a single cardiac myocyte was focused through a 10x objective of an inverted microscope and projected onto a linear photodiode array having 256 self-scanning elements. This array was used as an edge detector to define cell length. The output from the array was fed into a digital-to-analog converter to produce an output voltage proportional to the myocyte length. In the present experiments the total scanning time for all the 256 elements was set at either 1.5 or 5 ms, thus allowing for detection of myocyte length changes during contraction. Results obtained using this system showed that the extent of shortening was 8.04 \u00b10.48 percent of the resting cell length (n = 15). The rate of shortening in these cells was 99.49 \u00b18.02 percent of the resting cell length/s. Similar results were obtained using a high speed film.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325663","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122173/04122179.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"929","endPage":"934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Technique to Measure the Rate and Magnitude of Shortening of Single Isolated Cardiac Myocytes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1986","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Technique to Measure the Rate and Magnitude of Shortening of Single Isolated Cardiac Myocytes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122179/","volume":"BME-33","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1986","pubMedId":"3770781","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Technique to Measure the Rate and Magnitude of Shortening of Single Isolated Cardiac Myocytes","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n10-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038902S","chronDate":"Oct.  1986","isNumber":"4122173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4122179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4122180,"authors":[{"name":"Jose C.

Hence, there is interest in lung sound analysis using time and frequency domain techniques to increase its usefulness in diagnosis. The sounds recorded or heard are, however, contaminated by incessant heart sounds which interfere in the diagnosis based on, and analysis of, lung sounds. A common method to minimize the effect of heart sounds is to filter the sound with linear high-pass filters which, however, also eliminates the overlapping spectrum of breath sounds. In this work we show how adaptive filtering can be used to reduce heart sounds without significantly affecting breath sounds. The technique is found to reduce the heart sounds by 50-80 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","volume":"BME-33","issue":"12","pubMedId":"3817847","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Heart Sounds from Lung Sounds by Adaptive Filterng","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Heart Sounds from Lung Sounds by Adaptive Filterng","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n12-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064892S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4122210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"74","articleId":"4122225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4122227,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick S.

A previously developed linear and nonlinear filtering scheme was used to provide input to the QRS detector decision section. We used the filtering to preprocess the database. This yielded a set of event vectors produced from QRS complexes and noise. After this preprocessing, we tested different decision rules on the event vectors. This step was carried out at processing speeds up to 100 times faster than real time. The role of the decision rule section is to discriminate the QRS events from the noise events. We started by optimizing a simple decision rule. Then we developed a progressively more complex decision process for QRS detection by adding new detection rules. We implemented and tested a final real-time QRS detection algorithm, using the optimized decision rule process. The resulting QRS detection algorithm has a sensitivity of 99.69 percent and positive predictivity of 99.77 percent when evaluated with the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","volume":"BME-33","issue":"12","pubMedId":"3817849","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Investigation of QRS Detection Rules Using the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Investigation of QRS Detection Rules Using the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n12-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019722S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4122210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"690","articleId":"4122227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4122229,"authors":[{"name":"Blake Hannaford","affiliation":["Applied Robotics and Teleoperators Group, Automated Systems Section, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Blake","lastName":"Hannaford","id":"37272234100"},{"name":"Steven Lehman","affiliation":["Department of Physical Education, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Lehman","id":"37295862900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4122229","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":469},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Discrete Fourier transforms","Spectrogram","Signal analysis","Wrist","Magnetic heads","Statistical distributions","Frequency","Muscles","Speech analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomedical Engineering","Electromyography","Fourier Analysis","Humans","Movement","Muscle Contraction","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122229","abstract":"We applied short-time Fourier analysis to surface electromyograms (EMG) recorded during rapid movements, and during isometric contractions at constant forces. We selected a portion of the data to be transformed by multiplying the signal by a Hamming window, then computed the discrete Fourier transform. Shifting the window along the data record, we computed a new spectrum each 10 ms. We displayed the transformed data in spectograms or \"voiceprints.\" This short-time technique allowed us to see time-dependencies in the EMG that are normally averaged in the Fourier analysis of these signals. Spectra of EMG's during isometric contractions at constant force vary in the short (10-20 ms) term. Moments of the spectral distribution show this variability. Short-time spectra from EMG's recorded during rapid movements were much less variable. The windowing technique picked out the typical \"three-burst pattern\" in EMG's from both wrist and head movements. Spectra during the bursts were more consistent than those during isometric contractions. Furthermore, there was a consistent shift in spectral statistics in the course of the three bursts. Both the center frequency and the variance of the spectral energy distribution grew from the first burst to the second burst in the same muscle. We discuss this pattern with respect to the origin of the EMG bursts in rapid movement. We also extend the analogy between electromyograms and speech signals to argue for future applicability of short-time spectral analysis of EMG.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325697","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122210/04122229.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short Time Fourier Analysis of the Electromyogram: Fast Movements and Constant Contraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Short Time Fourier Analysis of the Electromyogram: Fast Movements and Constant Contraction","volume":"BME-33","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","pubMedId":"3817851","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short Time Fourier Analysis of the Electromyogram: Fast Movements and Constant Contraction","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n12-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047362S","chronDate":"Dec.  1986","isNumber":"4122210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"67","articleId":"4122229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4122230,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine Marque","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Compiegne University, Compiegne, France"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Marque","id":"37295857200"},{"name":"Jacques M.

The proposed GMDH correction method has the capability to design a two-dimensional nonlinear autoregressive model which represents the relationship between distorted measurements and their corrected estimates of the mandibular displacement for the initial adjustment of kinesiographic signals under ferromagnetic influences. A computational procedure of a GMDH correction method is described in which the mathematical structure of a nonlinear autoregressive model is identified in a self-organized manner. Heuristic determination of a restricted sensor array zone of a kinesiograph is proposed to obtain effective fitness of a particular GMDH correction model which corresponds to each of the concomitant restricted zones.

The geometric size of the electrode areas is usually in the range of between 50 and 10 000 \u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. The size limitations of these thin-film probes are mainly determined by the electrode-electrolyte interface and insulation layer qualities. Since medical research problems, as well as surgical requests, are stressing these limitations, some estimates of maximum resolution and probe dimensions are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325894","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122241/04122263.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"223","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin-Film Multiple Electrode Probes: Possibilities and Limitations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Thin-Film Multiple Electrode Probes: Possibilities and Limitations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122263/","volume":"BME-33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","pubMedId":"3957371","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin-Film Multiple Electrode Probes: Possibilities and Limitations","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n2-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0365S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"4122241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"87","articleId":"4122263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4122264,"authors":[{"name":"Spencer L.

These probes consist of a silicon substrate which supports an array of thin-film conductors. The conductors are insulated above and below with deposited dielectrics. The electrode sites are defined by openings in the upper dielectric layer and are inlaid with gold to form low-impedance recording surfaces. The probes are typically 15 pim in thickness with shank widths as narrow as 20 \u03bcm. The probe fabrication process is compatible with the inclusion of signal processing circuitry directly on the probe substrate. A 12 channel on-chip signal processor design with per-channel gain of 100, bandwidth of 100 Hz-6 kHz, multiplexed output, and recording-site impedance check capability is described. The probes have adequate strength to penetrate the gerbil pia-arachnoid layer and have recorded single neuron activity of over 500 \u03bcV peak-to-peak from tip, side, and mid-carrier sites. Signal-to-noise ratios as high as 10:1 have been achieved. An equivalent circuit model for the conducting leads, the recording site, and the electrode-electrolyte interface is described. Development of biocompatible insulation and encapsulation materials for long-term implantation of active probes is underway.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122241/04122264.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solid-State Electrodes for Multichannel Multiplexed Intracortical Neuronal Recording","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Electrodes","Probes","Dielectric substrates","Transistors","Extracellular","Information processing","Prosthetics","Silicon","Dielectric thin films"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Cerebral Cortex","Electrodes, Implanted","Electroencephalography","Gerbillinae","Microelectrodes","Neurons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1986","displayDocTitle":"Solid-State Electrodes for Multichannel Multiplexed Intracortical Neuronal Recording","volume":"BME-33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","pubMedId":"3957372","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solid-State Electrodes for Multichannel Multiplexed Intracortical Neuronal Recording","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n2-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066451S","chronDate":"Feb.  1986","isNumber":"4122241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"108","articleId":"4122264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4122265,"authors":[{"name":"Ivar Giaever","affiliation":["General Electric Company Limited, Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ivar","lastName":"Giaever","id":"37295875500"},{"name":"Charles R.

The electrolytic corrosion of cable conductors and integrated circuit metallizations is the principal danger. The published performance of the materials which have been used to date to encapsulate nonintegrated sensors and conductors is evaluated, and found to be unreliable for these applications. So, too, are the metals which have been used as electrical conductors. New techniques being developed in the attempt to achieve \"hermeticity on a chip\" are described. Finally, a critical, residual aspect of the overall problem is identified: how to make a mechanically rugged and inherently noncorrodible connection between a cable and a thin film on a silicon chip.

While compression ratios of 10:1 are feasible for the S-Q interval, the clinical information requirements limit this ratio to 3:1 for the QRS complex. With an overall compression ratio greater than 7, the quality of the reconstructed signal is well suited for morphological studies.

Much work in this area relies, implicitly or explicitly, on the assumption of normally distributed noise. This is a reasonable approximation, as our results for visual evoked potentials indicate: the distribution of the noise is in fact rather symmetric but mildly longer-tailed than to be expected for the normal distribution. Robust averages (trimmed means, redescending M-estimates), designed for handling such situations, offer only modest advantages compared to the ordinary average, as judged from an evaluation of the methods based on real data.

The model was also used to analyze the effects of these variations on individual terms in the orthogonal series expansion. The ability to reconstruct separate, local electrical events on the epicardium was examined under the following simulated situations: 1) all conductivity and geometry parameters were known accurately, 2) the conductivity of individual torso tissue layers was varied, 3) the torso-air boundary was eliminated (the \"infinite medium\" assumption), 4) the heart position was not accurately known, and 5) the heart size was not accurately known. Variation in conductivity and geometry parameters was found to exert a quantitative and qualitative effect on the amplitude, resolution, and position of the reconstructed epicardial maxima and minima. Significant differences were found in the ability of the inverse procedure to recover epicardial potentials resulting from posterior as opposed to anterior myocardial sources. Important conclusions regarding the narrow allowance for error in heart size and position, and the relative contributions of the torso tissue layer conductivities can provide guidelines for inverse reconstruction of epicardial potentials with a realistic model utilizing the true geometry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Inverse Problem in Electrocardiography: A Model Study of the Effects of Geometry and Conductivity Parameters on the Reconstruction of Epicardial Potentials","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325756","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122357/04122363.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","displayDocTitle":"The Inverse Problem in Electrocardiography: A Model Study of the Effects of Geometry and Conductivity Parameters on the Reconstruction of Epicardial Potentials","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-33","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"July 1986","pubMedId":"3733124","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Inverse Problem in Electrocardiography: A Model Study of the Effects of Geometry and Conductivity Parameters on the Reconstruction of Epicardial Potentials","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n7-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055447S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"4122357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"135","articleId":"4122363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4122367,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Mu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kun-Mu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291294100"},{"name":"Devendra Misra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Devendra","lastName":"Misra","id":"37295648700"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292565000"},{"name":"Huey-Ru Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Huey-Ru","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37065957400"},{"name":"Elliot Postow","affiliation":["Naval Medical Research and Development Command, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Elliot","lastName":"Postow","id":"37295654800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4122367","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":215,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1601},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Heart beat","Erbium","Research and development","Permittivity","Optical modulation","Circuits","Biomedical monitoring","Phase modulation","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Emergency Medicine","Heart Rate","Humans","Microwaves","Monitoring, Physiologic","Respiration"]}],"abstract":"An X-band microwave life-detection system has been developed for detecting the heartbeat and breathing of human subjects lying on the ground at a distance of about 30 m or located behind a cinder block wall.

The static nonlinearity describes the relationship between pulse width and steady-state force. The dynamic properties are described with less than 10 percent error by a second-order discrete-time deterministic autoregressive moving average (DARMA) model. Exponentially weighted recursive least squares methods allow efficient parameter estimation. Model parameters are found to vary systematically with muscle length and stimulus frequency. Tests comparing actual and simulated feedback control of electrically stimulated muscle indicate that the model is adequate for digital controller design for applications in functional electrical stimulation.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1986.325776","startPage":"829","endPage":"838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122402/04122407.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete-Time Model of Electrcally Stimulated Muscle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122407/","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete-Time Model of Electrcally Stimulated Muscle","volume":"BME-33","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"3759113","publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discrete-Time Model of Electrcally Stimulated Muscle","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-33-n9-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032067S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4122402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"84","articleId":"4122407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4122420,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald D.

However, this statement assumes that the incident field is a plane wave, which is not true in general for finite aperture sources. Consequently, the probing of flows transverse to the axis of finite diameter beams, particularly focused beams, is feasible.

The algorithm is attractive for several reasons. A modified Newton-Raphson method varies a finite-element model of resistivities to fit a set of voltage measurements in a least-squared sense. Two procedures for calculating the Jacobian matrix are derived. One is standard, while the other is based on the compensation theorem. This second procedure is more efficient for computations, and just as accurate as the standard one. The inherent ill-conditioning in the approximate Hessian matrix of the linearized system is eliminated using the Marquardt method. Results from two-dimensional computer simulations are compared to four other reconstruction algorithms, which are based on methods proposed by other authors. The modified Newton-Raphson method provided significantly better reconstructions than any of the other methods. The algorithms compared are the perturbation, equipotential, iterative-equipotential, and the double-constraint methods. The modified Newton-Raphson method was found to be sensitive to measurement error, but future work in designing electrode-probing configurations is expected to reduce this sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1987.326032","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122455/04122459.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1987.326032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Reconstruction Algorithms for Electrical Impedance Tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Reconstruction Algorithms for Electrical Impedance Tomography","volume":"BME-34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","pubMedId":"3692503","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Reconstruction Algorithms for Electrical Impedance Tomography","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-34-n11-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036544S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"4122455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"420","articleId":"4122459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":4122479,"authors":[{"name":"Maria A.

Frequency domain methods, such as the method of moments (MoM) have achieved some success; however, MoM requires computer storage on the order of (3N) 2 and computation time on the order of (3N) 3 where N is the number of cells. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been employed extensively in calculating the scattering of metallic objects, and recently is seeing some use in calculating the interaction of EM fields with complex, lossy dielectric bodies. Since the FDTD method has storage and time requirements proportional to N, it presents an attractive alternative to calculating SAR distribution in large bodies. This paper describes the FDTD method and evaluates it by comparing its results to analytic solutions in two and three dimensions. The utility of the FDTD method is demonstrated by a 3D scan of the human torso. The results obtained demonstrate that the FDTD method is capable of calculating internal SAR distribution with acceptable accuracy. With the availability of supercomputers, such as the CRAY II, the calculation of SAR distribution in a man model of 50 000 cells (1.27 cm per cell) appears to be feasible.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1987.326039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122487/04122497.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1987.326039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122487","startPage":"148","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method in Calculating EM Absorption in Human Tissues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method in Calculating EM Absorption in Human Tissues","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","pubMedId":"3557494","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method in Calculating EM Absorption in Human Tissues","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-34-n2-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052665S","chronDate":"Feb.  1987","isNumber":"4122487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"149","articleId":"4122497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4122499,"authors":[{"name":"Fuqin Q.

Both techniques are based on the singular value decomposition of a measurement matrix. Criteria are given in order to evaluate, a priori, electrode locations and sampling schemes for both methods. A fundamental difference with other methods is that the number of linearly independent FECG signals is not constrained to one. One of the presented techniques is a typical offline method. It is well suited for a large number of electrodes and large number of samples, which results in a better signal to noise ratio. The second technique is a typical on-line method. It gives fetal ECG signals within about 1 s, and is adaptive to changes of the transfer (e.g., due to fetal movement). It can be applied with a small number of electrodes (e.g., eight). It is shown that if three of these signals are from thoracic electrodes, the MECG suppression is guaranteed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"BME-34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","pubMedId":"3570313","displayDocTitle":"Two Methods for Optimal MECG Elimination and FECG Detection from Skin Electrode Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Methods for Optimal MECG Elimination and FECG Detection from Skin Electrode Signals","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-34-n3-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058348S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4122506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4122515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4122531,"authors":[{"name":"Mani Soma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Mani","lastName":"Soma","id":"37275850100"},{"name":"Douglas C.

The algorithm is a self-tuning controller that determines the input on the basis of the expected difference between the output and desired output at a time interval equal to or greater than the system dead time. The algorithm was used to simultaneously control mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in anesthetized dogs by the simultaneous computer-controlled infusion of sodium nitroprusside and dobutamine. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using CAMAC for multivariable drug delivery, but they indicate the need for further work before clinical applications are attempted.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Drug delivery","Pressure control","Dogs","Control systems","CAMAC","Adaptive algorithm","System testing","Blood pressure"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Biomedical Engineering","Blood Pressure","Cardiac Output","Dobutamine","Dogs","Infusion Pumps","Nitroprusside"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1987.326093","startPage":"617","endPage":"623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122589/04122599.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1987.326093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multivarable Drug Delivery: Control of Artenal Pressure and Cardiac Output in Anesthetized Dogs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multivarable Drug Delivery: Control of Artenal Pressure and Cardiac Output in Anesthetized Dogs","pubMedId":"3623588","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","volume":"BME-34","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multivarable Drug Delivery: Control of Artenal Pressure and Cardiac Output in Anesthetized Dogs","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-34-n8-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039526S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"4122589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"64","articleId":"4122599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4122618,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Jeffs","affiliation":["Hughes Aircraft Company, Buena Park, CA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Jeffs","id":"37279043800"},{"name":"Richard Leahy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Leahy","id":"37272216600"},{"name":"Manbir Singh","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Manbir","lastName":"Singh","id":"37280903100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4122618","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","SQUIDs","Biomedical imaging","Neurons","Current density","Magnetic field measurement","Sensor arrays","Superconducting devices","Interference","Detectors"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomedical Engineering","Brain","Brain","Evaluation Studies as Topic","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetics","Models, Theoretical","Neurons"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we discuss several aspects of a potential new medical imaging modality for producing a quantitative three-dimensional map of neuron current densities associated with brain function. The neuromagnetic image is produced by reconstructing a current dipole field from external magnetic field measurements made with an array of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) detectors. This field is produced by numerical inversion of the Biot-Savart equation. The purpose of the work is to investigate fundamental limits on the feasibility of the proposed system under ideal conditions. The following problems are addressed: 1) What are the factors limiting resolution of the system? 2) What is a suitable model for neural activity in the brain? 3) What classes of algorithms are suitable for estimating the model parameters? The major conclusion of this work is that the inversion problem is severely ill-posed and the choice of model and estimation algorithm are crucial in obtaining reasonable solutions. A class of solutions, termed minimum dipole, is proposed as a means of obtaining more acceptable results.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122608/04122618.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"723","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1987.325996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1987.325996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evaluation of Methods for Neuromagnetic Image Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1987","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Methods for Neuromagnetic Image Reconstruction","publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","pubMedId":"3653912","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-34","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Methods for Neuromagnetic Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-34-n9-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03883S","chronDate":"Sept.  1987","isNumber":"4122608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"118","articleId":"4122618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4122629,"authors":[{"name":"Roger C.

Recent advances in experimental capabilities have made possible the near simultaneous measurement of both cardiac epicardial and corresponding body surface potential distributions from in vivo animal preparations using chronically implanted electrodes to keep the volume conductor intact. This report provides a method for finding transfer coefficients that relate the epicardial and body surface potential distributions to each other. The method is based on knowing the geometric location of each electrode, and on having enough electrodes to establish the geometric shape and the potential distribution of closed epicardial and body surfaces. However, the method does not require that either the heart or body surfaces have any special shape, such as that of a sphere, or that any electrical quantities, such as voltage gradients, be known in addition to the potentials. The use of potential distributions to represent heart electrical activity is advantageous since such distributions can be directly measured experimentally, without a transformation to any other form, such as multiple current-generating dipoles, being required. This report includes a statement of the underlying integral equations, the procedure. for finding the equations' coefficients from geometry measurements, some considerations for computer algorithms, and an example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relating Epicardial to Body Surface Potential Distributions by Means of Transfer Coefficients Based on Geometry Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1977.326201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122628/04122629.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1977.326201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1977","displayDocTitle":"Relating Epicardial to Body Surface Potential Distributions by Means of Transfer Coefficients Based on Geometry Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-24","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1977","pubMedId":"832882","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relating Epicardial to Body Surface Potential Distributions by Means of Transfer Coefficients Based on Geometry Measurements","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-24-n1-1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048536S","chronDate":"Jan.  1977","isNumber":"4122628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"232","articleId":"4122629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4122634,"authors":[{"name":"Richard L.

In order to quantify the activity of an individual neuron in the record some form of spike discrimination is required. This paper describes a window discriminator for the separation of multi-unit neuronal spike trains which will display simultaneously the recorded spike information and the time-amplitude window levels. The window levels are displayed and can be delayed to include any portion of the spike waveform either above or below the initial threshold level. Several instruments can be cascaded for multiple time-amplitude interrogations of the same spike class from a single electrode recording. The instrument utilizes inexpensive commercially available integrated circuits.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1977.326198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122722","startPage":"486","endPage":"489","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122722/04122738.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Time-Amplitude Window Discriminator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1977","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Improved Time-Amplitude Window Discriminator","publicationDate":"Sept. 1977","pubMedId":"408262","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"BME-24","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Time-Amplitude Window Discriminator","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-24-n5-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045783S","chronDate":"Sept.  1977","isNumber":"4122722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"34","articleId":"4122738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4122767,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Watkins","affiliation":["Center for Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Watkins","id":"37288784100"},{"name":"G.

This light is reflected from both the nonmoving tissues (reference beam) and moving red blood cells (Doppler shifted beam), received by a plastic fiber, and transmitted back to a photodiode where optical heterodyning occurs. The heterodyned output signal, which is proportional to the Doppler shift frequency, is amplified and both RMS and dc values obtained.

Platinum-iridium electrodes remain stable over long periods of time, whereas the impedance of silver wire electrodes increases and eventually the silver fractures. The impedance at low frequencies (e.g., 10 Hz) provides a measure of the capacitance of the metal electrodes, whereas the impedance at higher frequencies (1 kHz) mainly measures the resistance of the tissue filling the cuff. Increases in resistance due to growth of connective tissue around intact nerves have been studied as well as changes in resistance after cutting a nerve.

In a sample of 220 Frank4ead ECG's the removal of signal redundancy by second-order prediction or interpolation with subsequent entropy encoding of the respective residual errors was investigated. At the sampling rate of 200 Hz, interpolation provided a 6 dB smaller residual error variance than prediction. A near-optimal value for the interpolation coefficients is 0.5, permitting simple implementation of the algorithm and requiring a word length for arithmetic processing of only 2 bits in extent of the signal precision. For linear prediction, the effects of occasional transmission errors decay exponentially, whereas for interpolation they do not, necessitating error control in certain applications. Encoding of the interpolation errors by a Huffman code truncated to \u00b15 quantization levels of 30 \u03bcV, required an average word length of 2.21 bits/sample (upper 96 percentile 3 bits/sample), resulting in data transmission rates of 1327 bits/s (1800 bits/s) for three simultaneous leads sampled at the rate of 200 Hz. Thus, compared with the original signal of 8 bit samples at 500 Hz, the average compression is 9:1. Encoding of the prediction errors required an average wordlength of 2.67 bits/sample with a 96 percentile of 5.5 bits/sample, making this method less suitable for synchronous transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression of the ECG by Prediction or Interpolation and Entropy Encoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1979.326543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4122952/04122957.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1979.326543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4122952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4122957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Compression of the ECG by Prediction or Interpolation and Entropy Encoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-26","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 1979","pubMedId":"511196","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of the ECG by Prediction or Interpolation and Entropy Encoding","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-26-n11-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057277S","chronDate":"Nov.  1979","isNumber":"4122952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"80","articleId":"4122957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4122978,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiko Okada","affiliation":["Department of Neurophysiology, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Okada","id":"37293126000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4122978","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":681},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Filter for the QRS Complex Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Electrocardiography","Computerized monitoring","Patient monitoring","Band pass filters","Circuits","Analog computers","Software performance","Performance analysis","Condition monitoring"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Arrhythmias, Cardiac","Computers","Diagnostic Errors","Electrocardiography","Humans","Monitoring, Physiologic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4122978","abstract":"The five step digital filter has been developed which removes components other than those of QRS complex from the recorded electrocardiogram (ECG).

A fixed array of 36 such conductors, terminating in six rows and six columns in a 0.5 mm x 1 mm area, is capable of monitoring simultaneous single unit activity from numerous neurons. Spike amplitudes of 300-500 \u03bcV are generally observed from the predominant 40 \u03bcm diameter cells of these ganglia. Giant neurons usually produce signal amplitudes of over 3 mV that are simultaneously seen by many electrodes. Signals can be monitored by merely resting a locally desheathed ganglion on the recording area under its own weight in a shallow pool of Ringer. A 10 \u03bcm diameter crater in a 3-4 \u03bcm thick insulation layer has an impedance of 2-4 M\u03a9at 1 kHz. The capacitance of this metal electrolyte interface is about 0.5 pF/\u03bcm2, suggesting that the UV laser produces a partially colloidal gold surface. With this recessed tip design, simultaneous single unit recording from small neurons appears ensured if electrode impedances are below 4 M\u03a9, shunt impedances are above 30 M\u03a9, and glia cells are not allowed to reinsulate the end of the gold conductor.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1979.326402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123041","startPage":"273","endPage":"279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4123041/04123046.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Single Unit Recording in vitro with a Photoetched Laser Deinsulated Gold Multimicroelectrode Surface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1979","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Single Unit Recording in vitro with a Photoetched Laser Deinsulated Gold Multimicroelectrode Surface","publicationDate":"May 1979","pubMedId":"447356","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"BME-26","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Single Unit Recording in vitro with a Photoetched Laser Deinsulated Gold Multimicroelectrode Surface","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-26-n5-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032389S","chronDate":"May  1979","isNumber":"4123041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"232","articleId":"4123046","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4123048,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry G.

Recruitment was modulated by varying either the pulsewidth or amplitude of a monophasic, rectangular, cathodal current pulse train. Force was a nonlinear function of either pulsewidth or amplitude, and the shape of the nonlinearity was the same regardless of which parameter was modulated. The charge per stimulus pulse was lowest if pulsewidth was modulated with a fixed, high amplitude stimulus. The shape of the nonlinear relationship between pulsewidth and force (recruitment characteristic) depended on stimulus amplitude, electrode location in the muscle and muscle length. In most applications the amplitude and location would be fixed, so force would be a two-dimensional nonlinear function of pulsewidth and muscle length. The results are discussed with respect to possible mechanisns of recruitment during intramuscular stimulation, and the implications of the nonlinearities on the proportional control of orthoses employing electrically stimulated muscles.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1980.326592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4123167/04123171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1980.326592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123167","startPage":"679","endPage":"684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation of Muscle Force by Recruitment During Intramuscular Stimulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4123171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulation of Muscle Force by Recruitment During Intramuscular Stimulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-27","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","pubMedId":"6970162","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation of Muscle Force by Recruitment During Intramuscular Stimulation","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-27-n12-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042462S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"4123167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"161","articleId":"4123171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4123174,"authors":[{"name":"Nitish V.

Since the signal is Gaussian, all available information is contained in the power spectrum, which is a blurred approximation to the velocity distribution in the region of observation.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1980.326708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4123188/04123191.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1980.326708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123188","startPage":"61","endPage":"67","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Study of the Scattering of Ultrasound from Blood","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4123191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Study of the Scattering of Ultrasound from Blood","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"BME-27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1980","pubMedId":"7353896","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Study of the Scattering of Ultrasound from Blood","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-27-n2-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031345S","chronDate":"Feb.  1980","isNumber":"4123188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"160","articleId":"4123191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4123242,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Azevedo","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Azevedo","id":"37285232100"},{"name":"Richard L.

The input is the command to the controlled stimulator and the output is the evoked contraction. Systems employing closed-loop force feedback to provide regulation of contractions were investigated in these studies. Force was modulated by both recruitment and temporal summation during intramuscular stimulation. Closed-loop systems with combined proportional and integral control were found to be stable and linear and to have good compensation for variations in muscle properties. A low proportional loop gain (approximately unity) was found necessary to prevent oscillation when modulating recruitment. Ratios of integral to proportional gain of about 10 gave the fastest response without compromising stability. The response time of the closed-loop system was as fast as or faster than the open-loop system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4123255/04123260.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.1980.326738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1980.326738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4123260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Control of Force During Electrical Stimulation of Muscle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Electrical stimulation","Muscles","Recruitment","Force feedback","Pi control","Proportional control","Control systems","Stability","Delay"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Cats","Electric Stimulation","Feedback","Muscle Contraction","Muscles","Reaction Time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1980","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Control of Force During Electrical Stimulation of Muscle","volume":"BME-27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1980","pubMedId":"7390527","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Control of Force During Electrical Stimulation of Muscle","sourcePdf":"TBME-vBME-27-n6-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033596S","chronDate":"June  1980","isNumber":"4123255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"109","articleId":"4123260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4123279,"authors":[{"name":"Necille Hogan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Necille","lastName":"Hogan","id":"37298867300"},{"name":"Robert W.

Unfortunately, there may be insufficient resources to allow for the reexecution of all test cases during regression testing. In this situation, test case prioritization techniques aim to improve the effectiveness of regression testing by ordering the test cases so that the most beneficial are executed first. Previous work on regression test case prioritization has focused on greedy algorithms. However, it is known that these algorithms may produce suboptimal results because they may construct results that denote only local minima within the search space. By contrast, metaheuristic and evolutionary search algorithms aim to avoid such problems. This paper presents results from an empirical study of the application of several greedy, metaheuristic, and evolutionary search algorithms to six programs, ranging from 374 to 11,148 lines of code for three choices of fitness metric. The paper addresses the problems of choice of fitness metric, characterization of landscape modality, and determination of the most suitable search technique to apply. The empirical results replicate previous results concerning greedy algorithms. They shed light on the nature of the regression testing search space, indicating that it is multimodal. The results also show that genetic algorithms perform well, although greedy approaches are surprisingly effective, given the multimodal nature of the landscape","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9402254","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4123325/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Search Algorithms for Regression Test Case Prioritization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Search Algorithms for Regression Test Case Prioritization","sourcePdf":"e0225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100133S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"4123321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"386","xplore-issue":"4123321","articleId":"4123325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4123343,"authors":[{"name":"John Makhoul","affiliation":["BBN Technologies, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Makhoul","id":"37283421800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0872-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0873-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4123343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Automatic speech recognition","Streaming media","Instruments","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information extraction","automatic speech recognition","large speech repositories","speaker clustering","topic classification","story segmentation","named entity extraction"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. The state of the art in automatic speech recognition has reached the point that searching for and extracting information from large speech repositories or streaming audio has become a growing reality. This paper summarizes the technologies that have been instrumental in making audio as searchable as text, including speech recognition, speaker clustering, segmentation, and identification; topic classification; and story segmentation. Once speech is turned into text, information extraction methods can then be applied, such as named entity extraction, finding relationships between named entities, and resolution of anaphoric references.

In this study we used the ICSI meeting corpus with high-level meeting recognition dialog act (MRDA) tags, that is, question, statement, backchannel, disruptions, and floor grabbers/holders. We performed controlled adaptation experiments using the Switchboard (SWBD) corpus with SWBD-DAMSL tags as the out-of-domain corpus.

The learnt policy, for filling and confirming information slots, was derived from COMMUNICATOR (flight-booking) data using reinforcement learning (RL) as described in [2], ported to the tourist information domain (using a general method that we propose here), and tested using 18 human users in 180 dialogues, who also used a state-of-the-art hand- coded dialogue policy embedded in an otherwise identical system. We found that users of the (ported) learned policy had an average gain in perceived task completion of 14.2% (from 67.6% to 81.8% at p < .03), that the hand-coded policy dialogues had on average 3.3 more system turns (p < .01), and that the user satisfaction results were comparable, even though the policy was learned for a different domain. Combining these in a dialogue reward score, we found a 14.4% increase for the learnt policy (a 23.8% relative increase, p < .03). These results are important because they show a) that results for real users are consistent with results for automatic evaluation [2] of learned policies using simulated users [3, 4], b) that a policy learned using linear function approximation over a very large policy space [2] is effective for real users, and c) that policies learned using data for one domain can be used successfully in other domains. We also present a qualitative discussion of the learnt policy.","doi":"10.1109/SLT.2006.326774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLT.2006.326774","startPage":"178","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4123332/4084711/04123391.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4084711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating effectiveness and portability of reinforcement learned dialogue strategies with real users: the talk TownInfo evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating effectiveness and portability of reinforcement learned dialogue strategies with real users: the talk TownInfo evaluation","conferenceDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4123391/","accessionNumber":"10251501","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123391/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating effectiveness and portability of reinforcement learned dialogue strategies with real users: the talk TownInfo evaluation","confLoc":"Palm Beach, Aruba","sourcePdf":"0000178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055422S","chronDate":"10-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4123332","isNumber":"4084711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4123332","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4084711","articleId":"4123391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4123402,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Besacier","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The specification of the Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) resolution constitutes one of the most critical activities in the design of digital UWB receivers. Moreover, multi-bit ADCs must be associated with an Automatic Gain Control block which avoids the sub-optimal regimes of the ADC dominated by quantisation or saturation noise. This paper shows how to determine the ADC resolution requirements and the optimal Automatic Gain Control (AGC) settings for the general class of digital receivers. We conclude that 3 bits provide sufficient resolution on condition that the AGC scales the input signal at a reference root mean squared (RMS) level of half the ADC saturation voltage.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","automatic gain control","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital pulsed ultra wideband receiver","analogue-to-digital converter resolution","automatic gain control block","quantisation noise","saturation noise","root mean squared level","ADC saturation voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["A/D Resolution","Digital Receiver","Gain Control"]}],"publicationTitle":"2006 IET Seminar on Ultra Wideband Systems, Technologies and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IET Seminar on Ultra Wideband Systems, Technologies and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4123612/4123613/04123638.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach for Specifying the ADC and AGC Requirements for UWB Digital Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4123638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"An Approach for Specifying the ADC and AGC Requirements for UWB Digital Receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4123638/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Apr. 2006","accessionNumber":"10076097","conferenceDate":"20-20 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-20 April 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach for Specifying the ADC and AGC Requirements for UWB Digital Receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"IET-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023828S","chronDate":"20-20 April 2006","isNumber":"4123613","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4123612","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4123638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4123812,"authors":[{"name":"Hugh Burchett","affiliation":["Cambridge Consultants"],"firstName":"Hugh","lastName":"Burchett"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-86341-647-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4123812","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4123812","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emergency services","portable instruments","radar applications","security","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through wall radars","portable radar interior space monitor system","short range radar technology","3D object position display","UWB radar systems","search and rescue","hostage rescue","area surveillance","area tracking","building security"]}],"publicationTitle":"2006 IET Conference on Crime and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IET Conference on Crime and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4123728/4123729/04123812.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4123729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in Through Wall Radar for Search, Rescue and Security Applications","abstract":"A PowerPoint presentation on the design and performance, applications and future developments of through wall radar systems is provided.

We find that a throughput-optimum density exists for a given fading coefficient and maximum transmit power, a result applicable to wireless Internet and sensor networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2006.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4124143","startPage":"19","endPage":"19","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4124142/4124143/04124168.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability of UWB Cognitive Radio Networks with Interference Constraint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4124168/","displayDocTitle":"Scalability of UWB Cognitive Radio Networks with Interference Constraint","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9857635","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability of UWB Cognitive Radio Networks with Interference Constraint","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"26290019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057105S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124142","isNumber":"4124143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124142","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4124143","articleId":"4124168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4124186,"authors":[{"name":"Nabila Soudani","affiliation":["ISETCOM, SUPCOM Tel Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nabila","lastName":"Soudani","id":"37297703400"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["SUPCOM, Tel Laboratory, National Engineering School of Sousse"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37297081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2629-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4124186","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"In this contribution, we consider the effect of carrier phase jitter on the performance of uplink multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) system and uplink multicarrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) system, assuming orthogonal spreading sequences. For this aim, it is proposed to model the phase jitter by Gaussian and Rayleigh laws. Theoretical expressions are derived for the performance degradation caused by the phase jitter. Assuming full load and ideal channel, it is shown that the performance degradation is independent of the number of carriers and the spreading factor, but depends on the jitter variance and the law followed by the phase jitter. Further, we point out that, first, the performance degradations are similar for both systems MC-CDMA and MC-DS-CDMA, and then, the Rayleigh model performs better than Gaussian model for the systems studied.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4124142/4124143/04124186.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"37","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2006.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2006.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4124143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4124186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of phase jitter models for uplink MC-CDMA and uplink MC-DS-CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Degradation","Multiaccess communication","Mobile communication","Oscillators","Laboratories","Telephony","Radio transmitters","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","Gaussian channels","jitter","radio links","Rayleigh channels","Rayleigh scattering","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier phase jitter model","uplink multicarrier direct sequence CDMA","MC-CDMA","code division multiple access","MC-DS-CDMA","orthogonal spreading sequence","Gaussian model","Rayleigh model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","MC-DS-CDMA","phase jitter","modeling","performance degradation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of phase jitter models for uplink MC-CDMA and uplink MC-DS-CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4124186/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9857653","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of phase jitter models for uplink MC-CDMA and uplink MC-DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"26290037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067919S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124142","isNumber":"4124143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124142","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4124143","articleId":"4124186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4124204,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Analysis shows that the degradation is higher for the station with a high data rate that operates with good signal to noise ratio (SNR). Consequently, the station with low SNR has higher throughput then stations with high SNR To evaluate the anomaly an experimental test was created to obtain the WLAN behavior with wireless host transmitting with low SNR together with hosts with high SNR. The anomaly was evaluated experimentally utilizing two architectures: fat and thin. The anomaly was detected in the fat architecture and was not detected in the Thin architecture. This paper presents a strategy to justify the result obtained with Thin architecture, using SNR to control the contention window and consequently mitigate the anomaly. Simulations using network simulator (NS) are presented to demonstrate the anomaly and to evaluate the mitigation anomaly strategy. The strategy configures the wireless stations with low SNR to work with large contention windows and wireless stations with high SNR with small contention windows. With this strategy the station with high SNR obtains higher throughput than the station with low SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4124142/4124143/04124204.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2006.61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2006.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4124143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4124204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating 802.11 Mac Anomaly Using SNR To Control Backoff Contention Window","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Wireless LAN","Quality of service","Degradation","Physical layer","Throughput","Testing","Proposals","Signal analysis","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["802.11 MAC anomaly","SNR","backoff contention window control","access point","WLAN behavior","network simulator","wireless stations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating 802.11 Mac Anomaly Using SNR To Control Backoff Contention Window","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4124204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9857670","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating 802.11 Mac Anomaly Using SNR To Control Backoff Contention Window","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"26290055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054485S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124142","isNumber":"4124143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124142","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4124143","articleId":"4124204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4124205,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Timus","affiliation":["Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Timus","id":"37297520800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2629-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4124205","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"abstract":"The use of cellular systems enhanced by fixed relays has previously been proposed as a way to provide wide area coverage for high bit-rate at a reduced cost of the wireless access network. In this paper, three amplify-and-forward relaying schemes are analysed on the downlink, in a scenario where 95% coverage has to be provided for a predefined bit-rate in a typical urban environment. Numeric results show that combining diversity, such as SIMO has only marginal gains over selection diversity when only one relay is used. The use of transmission diversity for the MIMO relaying scheme reduces the base station density, but the relaying gain is comparable with the ones for selection and SIMO. With the random (unplanned) relay deployment considered in this study, 0.03 to 0.15 base stations are saved for each deployed relay. This means that the cost of a relay can be at most 3 to 15% the cost of a base station. The highest reduction is achieved when micro base stations are used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4124142/4124143/04124205.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICWMC.2006.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWMC.2006.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4124143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4124205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coverage Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Schemes in Outdoor Urban Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Base stations","Costs","Diversity reception","MIMO","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Downlink","Bandwidth","Cellular networks","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage analysis","amplify-and-forward relaying","outdoor urban environment","cellular systems","wireless access network","MIMO relaying scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Coverage Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Schemes in Outdoor Urban Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4124205/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9857671","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coverage Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Schemes in Outdoor Urban Environment","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"26290056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066448S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124142","isNumber":"4124143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124142","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4124143","articleId":"4124205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4124208,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Rizaner","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical and Electronic Eng, Eastern Mediterranean University, Magosa, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Rizaner","id":"37297473600"},{"name":"Hasan Amca","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical and Electronic Eng, Eastern Mediterranean University, Magosa, TURKEY"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Amca","id":"37297446400"},{"name":"Kadri Hacioglu","affiliation":["University of Colorado at Boulder"],"firstName":"Kadri","lastName":"Hacioglu"},{"name":"Ali H.

The improved receiver is based on the principle of splitting the signal space into three subspaces associated with the desired signal, the interfering signals and the white noise. The interference is suppressed by projecting the received signal onto the subspace orthogonal to the interference subspace. The receiver estimates the interference subspace from selected sample by subtracting the reliable estimate of desired signal. Reliability is determined by the log likelihood ratio (LLR) of the estimate given by the blind MMSE receiver. To estimate the interference subspace more reliably, we only use the received samples for which the desired signal can be estimated with low probability of error. We construct a blind-MMSE and matched filter (MF) receiver based on this concept and both of them are compared against conventional blind multiuser detectors and are shown to perform better. The new subspace splitting receivers for efficient small block size for used the transmitted data, making them suitable for applications which require low time delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4124217/","accessionNumber":"9857683","displayDocTitle":"Blind Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) Multiuser Detection with Reliable Subspace Estimation (RSE)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) Multiuser Detection with Reliable Subspace Estimation (RSE)","confLoc":"Bucharest, Romania","sourcePdf":"26290068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041178S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124142","isNumber":"4124143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124142","xplore-issue":"4124143","articleId":"4124217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4124271,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Peretto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Alma Mater Studiorum Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Peretto","id":"37275814900"},{"name":"Luigi Rovati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Rovati","id":"37273656600"},{"name":"Giorgia Salvatori","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgia","lastName":"Salvatori","id":"37272512800"},{"name":"Roberto Tinarelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Alma Mater Studiorum Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Tinarelli","id":"37273905600"},{"name":"Alexander E.

The aim is to generate useful acoustic 3D images in underwater context. Towards this end, a planar array is mandatory, as a linear aperture does not allow one to discriminate signals coming from a 3D space. One critical issue in the development of high-resolution 3D sonar systems is the hardware cost associated to the necessary huge number of sensors. In this paper, an innovative 3D imaging system able to operate at different resolution levels is proposed that is based on a single sparse planar array consisting of only 584 elements. Such a limited number of sensors represents an important stage in designing 3D acoustic imaging systems, making feasible the achieving of a drastic reduction in both costs and successive processing associated to the system. The array optimization is performed by an efficient stochastic method based on the simulated annealing algorithm, in which the positions and the weights of the array elements are optimized simultaneously. To test the validity of the proposed system, the signals received by the sparse array as the response of a given scene insonifled by a pulse are simulated. To move from the simulated signals to the 3D image of the scene, a voxel-based beamforming in the time domain is designed. To assess the proposed acoustic imaging system, several complex scenes are taken into account and images are obtained that exhibit a high fidelity to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the assumed underwater environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 April 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9088808","htmlLink":"/document/4124355/","conferenceDate":"24-27 April 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design and Assessment of a Low-Cost 3-D Sonar Imaging System Based on a Sparse Array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Assessment of a Low-Cost 3-D Sonar Imaging System Based on a Sparse Array","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077367S","chronDate":"24-27 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124238","isNumber":"4124239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124238","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4124239","articleId":"4124355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4124367,"authors":[{"name":"Jianmin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281466700"},{"name":"Marina Y.

Operating two independent oscillators with related frequencies forms the accurate shifts. One of these is used to excite an ultrasonic transducer, and the other to clock the analogue to digital converter (ADC).

One of the parameters characterizing a DAS is its maximum sample rate, which poses constraints on signals that can be alias-free digitized. Band-pass sampling theory singles out separated ranges of admissible sample rates which can be significantly lower than carrier frequency. But, how to choose the most convenient sample rate according to the purpose at hand? The paper proposes a method mandated to the automatic selection of optimal sample rate for band-pass signals, which takes also into account the effects of sample clock instability and limited resolution. The proposed method allows the user to choose the location of spectral replicas of the sampled signal in terms of normalized frequency, and the minimum guard-band between replicas, thus introducing a feature that no DAS currently available on the market seems to offer. Experimental tests on band-pass digitally modulated signals for communications are carried out to verify the concurrence of actual central frequency with the expected one","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Clocks","Data acquisition","Sampling methods","Bandwidth","Signal resolution","Instruments","Communication systems","Iterative algorithms","Instrumentation and measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal sample rate","band-pass signals","data acquisition systems","band-pass sampling theory","sample clock instability","spectral replicas","digitally modulated signals","signal sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band-pass sampling","Data acquisition systems","Band-pass communication signals","Time-base instability","Clock accuracy","Automatic measurement systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2006.328602","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4124238/4124239/04124580.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4124239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.2006.328602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Selection of Optimal Sample Rate for Band-Pass Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4124580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Selection of Optimal Sample Rate for Band-Pass Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4124580/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4124580/","accessionNumber":"9097742","conferenceDate":"24-27 April 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 April 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Selection of Optimal Sample Rate for Band-Pass Signals","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"IMTC-00-341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048042S","chronDate":"24-27 April 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4124238","isNumber":"4124239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4124238","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4124239","articleId":"4124580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4124589,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Laquerre","affiliation":["Laboratoire dE28099\u00e9lectronique de lE28099ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Laquerre","id":"37698221500"},{"name":"Olivier Bernal","affiliation":["Laboratoire dE28099\u00e9lectronique de lE28099ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Bernal","id":"37563642400"},{"name":"Marc Lescure","affiliation":["Laboratoire dE28099\u00e9lectronique de lE28099ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Lescure","id":"37273401500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9360-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9359-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-5281"}],"articleNumber":"4124589","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4124589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Charge coupled devices","Voltage","Switches","CMOS technology","Signal processing","Data mining","Switching circuits","MOS capacitors","Parasitic capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamping circuit architecture","charge injection","analog switches","CMOS technology","operational amplifiers","CCD sensor","differential amplifier","0.35 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clamp","CCD sensor","Charge injection","Differential amplifier","Low-voltage CMOS"]}],"abstract":"By analyzing the classic clamping circuit, it is shown that the analog switches limit the precision of such a circuit, to 12 bits for 10Msamples/s signals, using a low-voltage CMOS 0.35mum technology.

On the other hand, their multi level cell counterparts are relatively not well-known, even though they have many advantages such as low area, high density, low power and short access time. To the best of our knowledge, no research papers have been published for multi level cell (MLC) flash memory testing and diagnosis. This paper is an attempt to bridge this gap by providing a simple solution to test and diagnose an MLC flash memory array. The fault model proposed takes into account many physical defects which cause the state of a memory cell to change. The universal test algorithm and the flash diagnosis (FDX) march algorithm proposed in this paper are a first of its kind for MLC flash.

Over-actuating an air vehicle provides a certain amount of redundancy for the flight control system, thus potentially allowing for recovery from off-nominal conditions. Due to this redundancy, control allocation algorithms are typically utilized to compute a unique solution to the over-actuated problem. Control allocators compute the commands that are applied to the actuators so that a certain set of forces or moments are generated by the control effectors. Usually, control allocation problems are formulated as optimization problems so that all of the available degrees of freedom can be utilized and, when sufficient control power exists, secondary objectives can be achieved.

Bivariate normal functions and limiting functions are combined to guarantee obstacle avoidance and control swarm member orientation and swarm movement as a whole.

Considering the robustness of the reconfiguration approach, we used the particle swarm optimization (PSO) by Tawdross, P. and Konig, A. (2005) as an alternative to GA for reconfiguration of programmable sensor electronics by Tawdross, P. et al. (2005) on basic block level. In order to evolve a reliable hardware with predictable performance, standard circuit topologies are employed. In this paper, we abstract our design environment from amplifier level to the functional block level. We demonstrate our methodology by a reconfigurable 3-bit flash analog to digital convert (ADC), which can recover successfully from static and dynamic deviations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-30 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4125772/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9177425","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4125772/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","conferenceDate":"30-30 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Reconfigurable Sensor Electronics - Case Study: 3 Bit Flash ADC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Reconfigurable Sensor Electronics - Case Study: 3 Bit Flash ADC","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"WISES-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039477S","chronDate":"30-30 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4125753","isNumber":"4125754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4125753","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4125754","articleId":"4125772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"INT.

Therefore, several approaches to volume rendering from compact representations of volumetric data have been published that avoid most of the data transfer between main memory and the graphics programming unit (GPU) at the cost of additional data decompression by the GPU. To reduce this performance cost, adaptive sampling techniques were proposed; which are, however, usually restricted to the sampling in view direction. In this work, we present a GPU-based volume rendering algorithm with adaptive sampling in all three spatial directions; i.e., not only in view direction but also in the two perpendicular directions of the image plane. This approach allows us to reduce the number of samples dramatically without compromising image quality; thus, it is particularly well suited for many compressed representations of volumetric data that require a computational expensive GPU-based sampling of data.","doi":"10.1109/APVIS.2007.329285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APVIS.2007.329285","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Asia-Pacific Symposium on Visualization","pdfPath":"/iel5/4126199/4100079/04126228.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Asia-Pacific Symposium on Visualization","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4100079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sampling in three dimensions for volume rendering on GPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sampling in three dimensions for volume rendering on GPUs","conferenceDate":"5-7 Feb. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4126228/","accessionNumber":"9309983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4126228/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sampling in three dimensions for volume rendering on GPUs","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"113_120_kraus.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057701S","chronDate":"5-7 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4126199","isNumber":"4100079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4126199","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4100079","articleId":"4126228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4126272,"authors":[{"name":"Aris Alissandrakis","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Adaptive Systems Research Group, University of Herfordshire, Hatfield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4126271/4126272/4126272-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aris Alissandrakis received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, U.K., in 2003 and the M.Eng. degree in cybernetics from the University of Reading, Reading, U.K., in 1999.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Adaptive Systems Research Group, School of Computer Science, at the University of Hertfordshire, where he studies imitation in the context of human\u2013robot interaction."]},"firstName":"Aris","lastName":"Alissandrakis","id":"37295745200"},{"name":"Chrystopher L.

The constraints of the actuator are treated in the controller design as the saturation nonlinearity. The adaptive critic NN controller architecture based on state feedback includes two NNs: the critic NN is used to approximate the \"strategic\" utility function, whereas the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the unknown nonlinear dynamic estimation errors. The critic and action NN weight updates are derived by minimizing certain quadratic performance indexes. Using the Lyapunov approach and with novel weight updates, the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop tracking error and weight estimates is shown in the presence of NN approximation errors and bounded unknown disturbances.

We describe results of the different developmental stages, involving perceptual and motor skills, implemented in our humanoid robot, Baltazar. At each stage, the system's attention is drawn toward different entities: its own body and, later on, objects and people. Our main contributions are the general architecture and the implementation of all the necessary modules until imitation capabilities are eventually acquired by the robot. Also, several other contributions are made at each level: learning of sensory-motor maps for redundant robots, a novel method for learning how to grasp objects, and a framework for learning task description from observation for program-level imitation.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4126299/","volume":"37","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4126299/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9355308","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17416165","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Automatically Tuning Intrusion Detection System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatically Tuning Intrusion Detection System","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb02-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10148S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4126271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4126271","articleId":"4126299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4126334,"authors":[{"name":"Keith M.

Whether you consider a personal automobile or a pilot's avionics, it must operate reliably, on demand, at an affordable cost. Consumer products such as automobiles, aircraft engines, medical diagnostic equipment, and computer server farms already employ remote diagnostics to monitor product health and optimize product availability. In this context, the next frontier is to evolve robust diagnostics into maturing prognostics and embed these technologies in our products in the form of health management system (HMS) capabilities. Using health based information for real time mission planning and autonomic maintenance is a key enabler for achieving ultra-reliability and availability in tomorrow's system of systems environment. The problem we face is how to best achieve these HMS capable products in a cost effective manner. Today's robust diagnostic technologies are proving to be key enablers for condition based maintenance, improved fault detection/fault isolation, and lower operational cost. Some success has been realized with the insertion of early prognostic technology, primarily in the area of mechanical PHM applications. By using a systematic methodology to develop, implement, and mature electronic prognostics into the next generation of HMS capable products, we are providing our customers (and most importantly the end user in the field) with new insight into the health and system readiness of our products.

Once a museum of HVDC technology development, the PDCI now contains the most modern equipment available. The owners of the southern converter station at Sylmar, California, have completely rebuilt the station, replacing nearly all of the converter equipment with modern high-power converters. At the northern end of the Intertie, at the Celilo converter station in The Dalles, Oregon, the changes have been more modest.

Based on Ricean fading channel model, our research is focused on the characteristics of the channel matrix such as the condition number. The initial discussion starts from a 4 times 4 MIMO scheme that the four antennas formed a square array on each side. A design constraint for antenna arrangement as a function of frequency and distance is derived for the LOS MIMO communication. Since rigorous constraint is difficult to achieve in practice, simulation results of the acceptable deviation from optimal design in different cases are presented.

In this paper, issues associated with crosstalk among bus lines implemented by CNTs are investigated in detail. CNT-based interconnects are modeled and the effects of crosstalk on performance and correct operation are evaluated by simulation. Existing models are modified to account for geometries in bus architectures made of parallel single-walled nanotubes and a single multiwalled nanotube. New RLC equivalent circuits are proposed for these bus architectures. A novel bus architecture with low crosstalk features is also proposed. This bus architecture is made of dual-walled nanotubes arranged in parallel. In this architecture, the crosstalk-induced delay and corresponding uncertainty (as well as crosstalk-induced peak voltage) are significantly reduced; a modest area penalty is incurred. Reductions up to 59% for the crosstalk-induced delay and up to 81% for the crosstalk-induced peak voltage are reported.

This is done through an investigation of the effect of four different matching methodologies on the gain of radio frequency CMOS LNAs by means of compact analytical expressions. It is demonstrated that methods that convert the MOSFET's input impedance to 50 Omega for power matching are more suitable for low-power applications than methods that create a real 50-Omega resistance at the input of the LNA, such as source inductive degeneration. As it is analytically shown, this is because the former methods enhance the gain of the LNA by a factor that is inversely proportional to MOSFET's input resistance. The impact of each matching methodology on the noise figure (NF) of the LNA is also discussed in detail and design guidelines for optimum gain-NF performance are developed using analytical models of MOSFET's noise parameters. It is demonstrated that all four methods could achieve very good NF values, provided that the size of active and passive components are chosen carefully based on the given guidelines. Measured results of two monolithic 5.7-GHz LNAs, designed and fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS technology, are also presented.

This proposed topology utilizes a push-pull scheme to realize sinusoidal output voltage. The previously published Class-E circuits (Sokal, 1981) can be implemented in a very simplified circuit. However, the simplified circuit is only appropriate for applications in which the harmonic content of output is not an important criterion. The proposed amplifier with two series-parallel resonant load networks will allow sinusoidal output voltage to be achieved by associating with the positive and negative quasi-sinusoidal waveforms. The complementarily activated configuration will provide continuous high-ripple-frequency input-current waveforms; this approach significantly reduces electromagnetic interference and requires very little filtering. With the symmetry of the push-pull Class-E circuit, there is the additional benefit that the even harmonics are suppressed at the load, and thus there are fewer harmonic distortions. However, each switch is symmetrically driven with a duty ratio of less than 0.5 to meet the nominal Class-E operating conditions, which leads to a narrower operating frequency variation. A prototype of the proposed PA shows over 95% efficiency at 48-V input, with 18-W output and an operating frequency of 900 kHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Resonance","Voltage","Power harmonic filters","Switches","Frequency","Switching circuits","RLC circuits","Tuned circuits","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit resonance","differential amplifiers","harmonic distortion","harmonics suppression","network topology","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["push-pull power amplifier","class-E power amplifier","LC resonant networks","series-parallel resonant power amplifier","sinusoidal output voltage","class-E circuits","positive quasisinusoidal waveforms","negative quasisinusoidal waveforms","high-ripple-frequency input-current waveforms","electromagnetic interference","harmonic distortions","differential amplifiers","900 kHz","18 W","48 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E power amplifier (PA)","harmonic distortion (HD)","high-efficiency amplifier","push\u2013pull amplifier","switching PA","zero-voltage switching (ZVS)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.887637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4126783/04126788.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4126783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.887637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Harmonic Push\u2013Pull Class-E Power Amplifier With a Pair of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Resonant Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4126788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Harmonic Push\u2013Pull Class-E Power Amplifier With a Pair of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Resonant Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4126788/","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4126788/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9362474","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Harmonic Push\u2013Pull Class-E Power Amplifier With a Pair of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">LC</emphasis> Resonant Networks","sourcePdf":"54tcsi03-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069368S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4126783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4126783","articleId":"4126788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4126792,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Franois Frigon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e8al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4126783/4126792/4126792-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Frigon (S'96\u2013M'01) received the B.Eng. degree from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 1996, the M.A.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2004.","From 2001 to 2003, he worked as the director of wireless communications systems at Innovics Wireless where he oversaw the design of a diversity enabled WCDMA terminal.

Whereas, in CCM, the parasitic capacitances of the switches only cause switching losses, in DCM, they are a source of converter instability, resulting in significant input-current distortion. In this paper, this source of input-current distortion is analyzed, and a solution is proposed. Experimental results are obtained using a digitally controlled boost PFC converter, which is designed to operate in CCM for 1 kW. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4118385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.892252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4118385/04126814.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"865","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.892252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input-Current Distortion of CCM Boost PFC Converters Operated in DCM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","displayDocTitle":"Input-Current Distortion of CCM Boost PFC Converters Operated in DCM","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4126814/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9400435","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4126814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input-Current Distortion of CCM Boost PFC Converters Operated in DCM","sourcePdf":"54tie02-degusseme.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082536S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4118385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4118385","articleId":"4126814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4126815,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The purpose of this combined measurement is, on one hand, to reach a similar performance as that obtained in the inductor current controller with load current feedforward and, on the other hand, to easily obtain an estimate of the inductor current for overcurrent protection capability. Based on this combined current measurement, a voltage controller based on resonant harmonic filters is investigated in order to compensate for unbalance and harmonic distortion on the load. Adaptation is included to cope with uncertainties in the system parameters. It is shown that after transformations the proposed controller gets a simple and practical form that includes a bank of resonant filters, which is in agreement with the internal model principle and corresponds to similar approaches proposed recently. The controller is based on a frequency-domain description of the periodic disturbances, which include both symmetric components, namely, the negative and positive sequence.

With this converter topology, the number of switching devices is reduced to six from ten in the case of full-bridge rectifier and three-leg inverter systems. In addition, the source voltage sensor is eliminated with a state observer, which controls the deviation between the model current and the system current to be zero. A simple scalar voltage modulation method is used for a two-leg inverter, and a new technique to eliminate the effect of the dc-link voltage ripple on the inverter output current is proposed.

It does not need any matched components to achieve high CMRR and its bandwidth is not gain-bandwidth product limited. Therefore, the wideband CMOS current conveyor has been used in this structure. HSPICE simulations have shown that its performance is quite satisfactory for wideband current-mode signal processing.

Often, the desired inputs must satisfy complex constraints, and this makes a random approach seem unlikely to succeed. We advance a visible arithmetic - GA (genetic algorithms) to solve this problem that how to generate efficiency testing case of embedded software for the designation path is covered with, because the key of automatic of software testing is the generation of efficiency testing case. In this paper, we discuss experiments with test generation problem that is harder than the ones discussed in earlier literature - we use a lager embedded program and more complex test adequacy criteria.

Among these, vehicular traffic is attracting a growing attention from both academia and industry, due to the amount and importance of the related applications, ranging from road safety to traffic control, up to mobile entertainment. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are self-organized networks built up from moving vehicles, and are part of the broader class of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Because of their peculiar characteristics, VANETs require the definition of specific networking techniques, whose feasibility and performance are usually tested by means of simulation. One of the main challenges posed by VANETs simulations is the faithful characterization of vehicular mobility at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, leading to realistic non-uniform distributions of cars and velocity, and unique connectivity dynamics. In this paper, we first present and describe VanetMobiSim, a freely available generator of realistic vehicular movement traces for networks simulators.

The performance of combinations of MAP and SOVA based equalizer and decoder is evaluated by simulation experiment. The performance does not improve much for more than five iterations in a severe ISI channel. The results obtained for 1 dB to 4 dB bit energy to noise power show that almost identical results are obtained for two other combinations of the SOVA and MAP in a serial concatenated scheme to take care of ISI. Theoretical analysis seems to support the viewpoint that all 4 possible combinations of MAP and SOVA algorithms result in an almost identical performance towards higher iteration numbers. Hence, SOVA-SOVA combination may be more suitable from implementation point of view than the other 3 combinations","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4127326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCTA.2007.118","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computing: Theory and Applications (ICCTA'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Computing: Theory and Applications (ICCTA'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4127325/4127326/04127347.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"86","doi":"10.1109/ICCTA.2007.118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SISO Based Turbo Equalization and Decoding for ISI Corrupted Wireless Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"SISO Based Turbo Equalization and Decoding for ISI Corrupted Wireless Channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4127347/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9420536","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4127347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SISO Based Turbo Equalization and Decoding for ISI Corrupted Wireless Channels","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"27700082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057748S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4127325","isNumber":"4127326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4127325","xplore-issue":"4127326","articleId":"4127347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4127353,"authors":[{"name":"Pritha Banerjee","affiliation":["Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Pritha","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"38277597400"},{"name":"Susmita Sur-Kolay","affiliation":["Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Susmita","lastName":"Sur-Kolay","id":"38272422400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2770-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4127353","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Simulated annealing","Routing","Switches","Costs","Computational modeling","Logic arrays","Circuit simulation","Phased arrays","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","simulated annealing","top down coarse partition allocation","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a placement method for island-style FPGAs, based on fast yet very good initial placement followed by refinement using ultra-low temperature simulated annealing.

It is heterogeneity and dynamics of the grid that make QoS problems in grid environment challenging. Computational grid's resource management must deal with various demands from users.

The objective of multiple QoS based grid resource scheduling is to maximize the global utility of the scheduling system.

The baseline drift may be linear, static, nonlinear or wavering. Reducing the baseline drift to a near zero value greatly helps in visually inspecting the morphology of the wave components as well as in computerized detection and delineation of the wave complexes. The algorithm is developed for computer implementation using Matlab. It deploys least squares error correction and correction based on overall median of individual single lead data, to reduce baseline drift.

Although methods based on fractional lower-order moments (FLOMs) have proven successful in dealing with non-Gaussian impulsive processes, they require in general the previous knowledge or estimation of characteristic exponent in order to choose an appropriate parameter value. In this paper, based on sigmoid transform, a robust approach for time delay estimation (TDE) is introduced in the presence of impulsive noise, referred to as sigmoid cross-correlation (SCC). Compare with algorithms based on FLOMs, the SCC method needs not to choose any parameter and is used under any characteristic exponent. The reason for the robustness of the SCC algorithm under the lower order alpha-stable noise condition is that sigmoid function transforms the lower order alpha-stable process into a second order alpha-stable process. Simulation studies show the novel method is robust for very impulsive environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4128765/4128766/04128803.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2006.344467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2006.344467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4128766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4128803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Time Delay Estimation Based on Sigmoid Transform in the Presence of Impulsive Noises","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Gaussian distribution","Signal processing algorithms","Radar signal processing","Physics","Stability","Limiting","Probability distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","delay estimation","impulse noise","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust time delay estimation","sigmoid transform","impulsive noises","alpha-stable distribution","fractional lower-order moments","nonGaussian impulsive processes","sigmoid cross-correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4128803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20  2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust Time Delay Estimation Based on Sigmoid Transform in the Presence of Impulsive Noises","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4128803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9464175","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2007","conferenceDate":"16-20 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Time Delay Estimation Based on Sigmoid Transform in the Presence of Impulsive Noises","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"A40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070367S","chronDate":"16-20  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4128765","isNumber":"4128766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4128765","xplore-issue":"4128766","articleId":"4128803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4128819,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Su","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory for Advanced Signal Processing, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Su","id":"37268428200"},{"name":"Renbiao Wu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory for Advanced Signal Processing, Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Renbiao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292105200"},{"name":"Yingning Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingning","lastName":"Peng","id":"37279371100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9736-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9737-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"4128819","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"In this paper, two nonparametric amplitude spectral estimators, which belong to the adaptive filtering-based approach, are proposed.

Those residual term dramatically reduce the accuracy of the spectral estimate at the frequency.

The proposed algorithm adopts inverse channel matrix for MIMO decoding, which is not sensitive to the coherency of channels. Because of the scattering characteristic of the MIMO channel, the inverse channel matrices are always nonsingular, which keeps the receivers can get stable spatial diversity gain. The MUD algorithms can be realized using a parallel modular architecture. MUD is based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm.

The PSO is designed to estimate optimal parameters of HMM. Some heuristic algorithms such as Baum-Welch algorithm are developed to optimize the model parameters to describe the training observation sequences. However, these methods are hill-climbing algorithms and easy to converge to local optimal solutions, which might deteriorate the speech recognition rate. A PSO-HMM training approach aimed at finding the global solution or better optimal solutions is proposed in this paper.

A hierarchy is usually constructed by regular subdivision of the bounding volume of a model, it is prone to non-adaptive to the irregular spatial distribution of sample points, and it may affect the quality of rendering. In this paper we present an approach to build up an adaptive hierarchical representation for a point-sampled 3D model. The binary space partition is used to recursively split a point-sampled model according to the principal component analysis of its sample points. Thus a model is subdivided along the direction of the greatest variation, and the partition is adaptive to the spatial distribution of its sample points. A multiresolution hierarchy based on bounding spheres is constructed for a model after this adaptive subdivision. We have constructed adaptive multiresolution hierarchies for several point-sampled models and display them based on the splatting.

They were used widely in image representation and recognition. A limitation of 2D methods is that, they only reflect the information between rows of images, while discarding columns information. More recently, a method called diagonal PCA (DiaPCA) was proposed to reserve the correlations between variations of rows and those of columns of images. DiaPCA seeks projection vectors from diagonal face images without image-to-vector transformation. However, DiaPCA does not involve any discrimination features, which are more than desirable in face recognition. In this paper, we propose a method named diagonal 2DLDA (Dia2DLDA) for face recognition. The proposed method projects face image samples by using an optimal projection vectors that derive from the diagonal representation of the image samples. Then, the projected image samples are employed to extract the discrimination features. The method compared with existing 2D schemes on two face databases. Results indicate that the performance of the Dia2DLDA overall better than other methods","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4128765/4129153/04129182.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4129182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using Diagonal 2D Linear Discriminant Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Covariance matrix","Feature extraction","Scattering","Image recognition","Image databases","Vectors","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image representation","image sampling","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","diagonal 2D linear discriminant analysis","2D principle component analysis","PCA","image representation","image recognition","image-to-vector transformation","optimal projection vectors","image samples","discrimination feature extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20  2006","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using Diagonal 2D Linear Discriminant Analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4129182/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9475166","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2007","conferenceDate":"16-20 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using Diagonal 2D Linear Discriminant Analysis","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"O09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094135S","chronDate":"16-20  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4128765","isNumber":"4129153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4128765","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4129153","articleId":"4129182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4129209,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Di","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Di","id":"38666739300"},{"name":"Quan Pan","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37278540400"},{"name":"Yong-qiang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yong-qiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37291007600"},{"name":"Lin He","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"He","id":"37588872700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9736-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9737-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"4129209","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"With the development of sensors capable of high spatial and spectral resolution, anomaly detection in multispectral imagery has gained more attention recently. However, using single detector meets great limitation due to that many of the conditions and parameters that govern performance are unknown or poorly characterized in an operational setting. Unlike the conventional fusion approaches simply using logical operators (e.g. AND, OR), which lead to produce highly variable performance results from one case and thus difficult to specify the \"best\" fusion logic in advance, a multiple-detector fusion (MDF) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Three successive procedures are included as follows: first, we use series anomaly detectors including well-known RX and its varieties to get the pilot detection results; and second, in order to estimate the pdf statistics of each individual detector's output more accurately, a nonparametric method called kernel density estimation (KDE) with bandwidth adjusted adaptively is used. The obtained probabilistic information are then fused using a modeled joint distribution by the principle of maximum entropy. Finally, the MDF approach is applied to real multispectral imagery.

For a mobile communication system, a key parameter is the system capacity. Multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver in a system have been recognized as a major technology breakthrough to increase the capacity of a wireless communication network. To mitigate this limited capacity problem, two full transmit rate STBCs are integrated into the long-code WCDMA system with four transmit antenna. The bit error rate (BER) performance for the proposed technique is compared with other conventional methods for quasi-static wireless channels. Simulation results show that the proposed full rate STBC scheme when combined with the receive antenna selection technique method yields improved BER performance schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4128765/4129153/04129242.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 8th international Conference on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4129242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Joint Full-Rate STBC and Long-Code WCDMA for Four Transmit Antenna MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Bit error rate","Block codes","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Wideband","Mobile communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","code division multiple access","error statistics","MIMO communication","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-code WCDMA","transmit antenna MIMO systems","extended orthogonal space-time block code","quasi-orthogonal space-time block code","long-code wideband code division multiple access","spatial diversity","wireless communication systems","mobile communication system","multiple antennas","bit error rate","quasi-static wireless channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Joint Full-Rate STBC and Long-Code WCDMA for Four Transmit Antenna MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4129242/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"10312410","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2007","conferenceDate":"16-20 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Joint Full-Rate STBC and Long-Code WCDMA for Four Transmit Antenna MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"Q05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046401S","chronDate":"16-20 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4128765","isNumber":"4129153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4128765","xplore-issue":"4129153","articleId":"4129242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4129243,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618600"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["Centre of Digital Signal Processing, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"},{"name":"Jonathon A.

The received signal is firstly sampled and divided into non-overlapping signal vectors according to a temporal window, which duration is a period of signature waveform. Then an autocorrelation matrix is computed and accumulated by these signal vectors one by one. Since we have assumed that the synchronous point between the symbol waveform and observation window have been known, the signal vectors may be sampled and divided at the beginning of this synchronous point, therefore, each vector must contain all information of signature waveforms. In the end, each signature waveform and its strength can be extracted by the principal eigenvector and its associated eigenvalue of autocorrelation matrix blindly. However, the eigenanalysis method belongs to a batch processing method, it becomes inefficiency when it uses in real-time signal process and input signal tracking.

To overcome this difficulty, two PTS schemes, the adjacent partition (AP-PTS) and the interleaved partition (IP-PTS), are proposed in this paper. For the AP-PTS, the difficulty is circumvented by rearranging the data sequence, while for the IP-PTS, constructing phase sequences sets is avoided by generating the real-valued OFDM candidate signals in the time domain directly. The performances of the two schemes are evaluated via simulations.

There has been no simple way to obtain the distance of LDPC codes because of the code length. Based on generation matrices, this paper develops an algorithm to estimate the upper bound of minimum weights and minimum distance of LDPC codes. The paper establishes the upper bounds of minimum weights and distances of LDPC codes by using the vectors of generation matrices, which is different from the presented probabilitistic search methods for the weights' and distances of LCPC codes.

Applying the independent component analysis (ICA) to blind detection of DS-CDMA signals with multi-path interference, we can get all the source signals without any information of the transmitted users. The basic feature of ICA method is able to estimate a set of independent source signals, but their order is somewhat unpredictable and the desired signal can be obtained directly. Since the spreading sequence of the mobile phone is initially known, this paper proposes a new method to estimate both the source signals and the corresponding spreading codes by ICA. The desired signal can be got by comparing the estimated spreading sequences with the initially known spreading sequence. The performance of the proposed method under Gaussian noise is also analyzed.

In our system, we put more information in the cyclic prefix (CP) of each OFDM symbol by implementing this CP as a training sequence (TS). One TS is repeatedly transmitted from each transmit antenna for the MIMO channel estimation at the receiver. By properly designing each TS for multiple antennas to be orthogonal in the time domain, the channel estimation can be executed based on semi-blind processing in the case of more than two transmit antennas. The approach has brought higher spectral efficiency and convenient implementation at the expense of one extra FFT at the receiver.

To solve the problem, this paper develops an improved structure of STS-CDMA system with complementary matching filters and Hamming orthogonal interleavers.

The data flow transmitted to one mobile user is interleaved by two hamming orthogonal interlevers and then spread by two orthogonal codes respectively. The spread data flows are sent to two transmit antennas at base station, while the mobile user despreads and deinterleaves the data flow by two matching filters and two deinterleavers respectively. Since the received data streams of the mobile user are orthogonal each other in space and time, the system performances (BER and SINR) can be improved remarkably.

The proposed MNN is trained using back-propagation (BP) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) training algorithms. The performance of these proposed MNNs is demonstrated by showing its effectiveness in GPS timing error prediction of a low cost GPS receiver. The tests results on the collected real data show that GPS timing error RMS can reduce from 300 nsec and 200 nsec to less than 120 nsec and 43 nsec by using MNN prediction, before and after SA, respectively.

The idea is based on the assumption of the MIMO channels of base station (BS) to mobile stations (MSs) to be fully non-coherent, which means that the row vectors of MIMO channels' matrix should be orthogonal each other. However, this paper shows that, for general application scenes, the row vectors of MIMO channels' matrix are not orthogonal each other, the MIMO system can only keep the channel matrix to nonsingular, which leads to great co-channel interference existing in the spatial MIMO channels allocated to mobile stations, and the caused BER degradation can not satisfy the communication specifications. To solve the problem, different from classical MIMO approach, this paper proposes utilize inversed channel matrix to decode the spatial signal, instead of transposed channel matrix.

Semi-supervised training is a means for reducing the effort needed to prepare the training set by training the model with a small number of fully labeled examples and an additional set of unlabeled or weakly labeled examples. In this work we present a semi-supervised approach to training object detection systems based on self-training. We implement our approach as a wrapper around the training process of an existing object detector and present empirical results. The key contributions of this empirical study is to demonstrate that a model trained in this manner can achieve results comparable to a model trained in the traditional manner using a much larger set of fully labeled data, and that a training data selection metric that is defined independently of the detector greatly outperforms a selection metric based on the detection confidence generated by the detector.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129447","startPage":"29","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129447/04129456.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Supervised Self-Training of Object Detection Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4129456/","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Supervised Self-Training of Object Detection Models","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"10265626","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Supervised Self-Training of Object Detection Models","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227110029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041741S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"276","xplore-issue":"4129447","articleId":"4129456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4129461,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Ming","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Ming","id":"37284399600"},{"name":"Zhihui Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Li","id":"37279077100"},{"name":"Zhengxuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Zhengxuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279251300"},{"name":"Xiaodong Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37291662400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4129461","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Iris recognition","Pattern matching","Biometrics","Spatial databases","Pattern analysis","Wavelet analysis","Image edge detection","Computer science","Stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","image matching","image recognition","image resolution","stochastic processes","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimatching process","iris recognition","personal identification","biometric","stochastic iris textural information","coarse matching","wavelet multiresolution decomposition","database"]}],"abstract":"As a most important biometric solution for personal identification, iris recognition has received increasing attention in recent years. Based on the features of the stochastic iris textural information and local time-frequency properties of the wavelet transform, this paper proposes a new method for iris recognition using a wavelet-based multi- matching system, which includes a coarse matching and its refinement. For the low-frequency components of the wavelet multi-resolution decomposition, a statistical correlation approach is adopted for a coarse matching so that well-matched iris templates in a database can be picked out and need to be further identified. The wavelet modulus maxima are used to locate the sharp variation points, which are taken as iris feature points. A similarity measure based on the distances between the best-matched feature point pairs is taken for the refinement of the coarse matching. Our method well employs the iris morphological characteristics and the multi-matching process to improve the efficiency. The experimental results indicate the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.78","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129447/04129461.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Matching Process Based on Wavelet Transform for Iris Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4129461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129461/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Matching Process Based on Wavelet Transform for Iris Recognition","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"10265628","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4129461/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Matching Process Based on Wavelet Transform for Iris Recognition","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227110066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082655S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4129447","articleId":"4129461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4129472,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Boehnen","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, USA","Sandia National Laboratories and University of Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Boehnen","id":"37299734800"},{"name":"Trina Russ","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories and University of Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Trina","lastName":"Russ","id":"37299677100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4129472","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Facial features","Face detection","Eyes","Face recognition","Laboratories","Image quality","Color","Detection algorithms","Nose","Mouth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image registration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast multi modal approach","facial feature detection","initial alignment problem","2D color image registration","3D face recognition algorithm"]}],"abstract":"As interest in 3D face recognition increases the importance of the initial alignment problem does as well.

We are developing a face recognition system that utilizes three-dimensional shape information to make the system more robust to arbitrary view, lighting, and facial appearance. For each subject, a 3D face model is constructed by integrating several 2.5D face scans from different viewpoints. A 2.5D scan is composed of one range image along with a registered 2D color image. The recognition engine consists of two components, surface matching and appearance-based matching. The surface matching component is based on a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.The candidate list used for appearance matching is dynamically generated based on the output of the surface matching component, which reduces the complexity of the appearance-based matching stage. The 3D model in the gallery is used to synthesize new appearance samples with pose and illumination variations that are used for discriminant subspace analysis. The weighted sum rule is applied to combine the two matching components. A hierarchical matching structure is designed to further improve the system performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results are given for matching a database of 100 3D face models with 598 2.5D independent test scans acquired in different pose and lighting conditions, and with some smiling expression. The results show the feasibility of the proposed matching scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129447/04129475.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4129475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Range and Texture Information for 3D Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Shape","Robustness","Color","Engines","Iterative closest point algorithm","Iterative algorithms","Image matching","Lighting","Independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image colour analysis","image matching","image texture","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture information","3D face recognition","facial appearance","three-dimensional shape information","2.5D face scans","2D color image","surface matching","appearance-based matching","iterative closest point algorithm","ICP","hierarchical matching structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Range and Texture Information for 3D Face Recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4129475/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"10265640","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Range and Texture Information for 3D Face Recognition","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227110156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085963S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4129447","articleId":"4129475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4129478,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, we examine the utility of such techniques for the scientifically-important problem of detecting and cataloging impact craters in planetary images gathered by spacecraft. Various supervised learning algorithms, including ensemble methods (bagging and AdaBoost with feed-forward neural networks as base learners), support vector machines (SVM), and continuously-scalable template models (CSTM), are employed to derive crater detectors from ground-truthed images. The resulting detectors are evaluated on a challenging set of Viking Orbiter images of Mars containing roughly one thousand craters. The SVM approach with normalized image patches provides detection and localization performance closest to that of human labelers and is shown to be substantially superior to boundary-based approaches such as the Hough transform.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.68","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129447/04129478.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"184","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Detect Small Impact Craters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Detect Small Impact Craters","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4129478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","accessionNumber":"10265641","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129478/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Detect Small Impact Craters","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227110178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084153S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4129447","articleId":"4129478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4129485,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Erol","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Erol","id":"37290052600"},{"name":"George Bebis","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Bebis","id":"37267262500"},{"name":"Richard D.

In these applications, the visual hull is used to approximate the 3D geometry of an object. Existing volumetric visual hull construction techniques, however, produce a 3-color volume data that merely serves as a bounding volume. In other words it lacks an accurate surface representation. Polygonization can produce satisfactory results only at high resolutions. In this study we extend the binary visual hull to an implicit surface in order to capture the geometry of the visual hull itself. In particular, we introduce an octree-based visual hull specific adaptive sampling algorithm to obtain a volumetric representation that provides accuracy proportional to the level of detail. Moreover, we propose a method to process the resulting octree to extract a crack-free polygonal visual hull surface. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.123","startPage":"234","endPage":"241","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129447/04129485.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Hull Construction Using Adaptive Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Visual Hull Construction Using Adaptive Sampling","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4129485/","accessionNumber":"10265647","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129485/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Hull Construction Using Adaptive Sampling","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227110234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058217S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4129447","articleId":"4129485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4129490,"authors":[{"name":"Aly A.

This method not only reliably determines whether objects predictably pass from one location to another without performing explicit correspondence, but it approximates the likelihood of those transitions. It is robust to non-stationary traffic processes that result from traffic lights, vehicle grouping, and other non-linear vehicle-vehicle interactions. Synthetic data allows us to test and verify our results for complex traffic situations over multiple city blocks and contrast it with previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4129591/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Track Objects Through Unobserved Regions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Track Objects Through Unobserved Regions","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227120096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084406S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4129571","articleId":"4129591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4129602,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Thangali","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Thangali","id":"37299314200"},{"name":"Stan Sclaroff","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stan","lastName":"Sclaroff","id":"37270373800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4129602","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion detection","Motion estimation","Sampling methods","Handicapped aids","Object segmentation","Joining processes","Parameter estimation","Frequency","Data mining","Computer science"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4129602","abstract":"A novel technique to detect and localize periodic movements in video is presented. The distinctive feature of the technique is that it requires neither feature tracking nor object segmentation. Intensity patterns along linear sample paths in space-time are used in estimation of period of object motion in a given sequence of frames. Sample paths are obtained by connecting (in space-time) sample points from regions of high motion magnitude in the first and last frames. Oscillations in intensity values are induced at time instants when an object intersects the sample path. The locations of peaks in intensity are determined by parameters of both cyclic object motion and orientation of the sample path with respect to object motion. The information about peaks is used in a least squares framework to obtain an initial estimate of these parameters. The estimate is further refined using the full intensity profile. The best estimate for the period of cyclic object motion is obtained by looking for consensus among estimates from many sample paths. The proposed technique is evaluated with synthetic videos where ground-truth is known, and with American Sign Language videos where the goal is to detect periodic hand motions.","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.91","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129571/04129602.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic Motion Detection and Estimation via Space-Time Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Periodic Motion Detection and Estimation via Space-Time Sampling","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4129602/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic Motion Detection and Estimation via Space-Time Sampling","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227120176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049852S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4129571","articleId":"4129602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4129609,"authors":[{"name":"David D.

The proposed method lengthens the period of time during which a human or vehicle can navigate in GPS-deprived environments. Our approach integrates well with existing navigation systems, because we invoke general sensor models that represent a wide range of available hardware. The inertial model includes errors in bias, scale, and random walk. Any purely projective camera and tracking algorithm may be used, as long as the tracking output can be expressed as ray vectors extending from known locations on the sensor body. A modified linear Kalman filter performs the data fusion. Unlike traditional SLAM, our state vector contains only inertial sensor errors related to position. This choice allows uncertainty to be properly represented by a covariance matrix. We do not augment the state with feature coordinates. Instead, image data contributes stochastic epipolar constraints over a broad baseline in time and space, resulting in improved observability of the IMU error states. The constraints lead to a relative residual and associated relative covariance, defined partly by the state history. Navigation results are presented using high-quality synthetic data and real fisheye imagery.","doi":"10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACVMOT.2005.48","publicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Seventh IEEE Workshops on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV/MOTION'05) - Volume 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/4129446/4129571/04129609.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4129571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epipolar Constraints for Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4129609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Epipolar Constraints for Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation","conferenceDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4129609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epipolar Constraints for Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation","confLoc":"Breckenridge, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"227120221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050585S","chronDate":"5-7 Jan. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4129446","isNumber":"4129571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4129446","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4129571","articleId":"4129609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4129632,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Chun-rong","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Chun-rong","id":"38271267800"},{"name":"Liu Ying","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Ying","id":"37416179600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9736-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9737-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5221"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-523X"}],"articleNumber":"4129632","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"In allusion to the character of HF channels, this paper presents an MB-OFDM system, which uses hopping carrier to reduce ISI caused by multi-paths in HF communications.

By comparing two visualizations, one based on data from 2002 and one based on data from 2006, we examine how the CI field has evolved over the last years. A quantitative analysis of the data further identifies a number of emerging areas within the CI field. The data that we use consist of the abstracts of the papers presented at the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) in 2002 and 2006.

In particular, ants have inspired a number of methods and techniques among which the most studied and the most successful is the general purpose optimization technique known as ant colony optimization. Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO.
