The packet length is normally constrained by the channel coherence time for a given bandwidth, beyond which channel tracking using an adaptive decision feedback equalizer becomes difficult. But if the channel is known for each block of coherence time, communications can proceed in principle continuously without time limitation. Using the iterative correlation-based equalizer where decision symbols are assumed to be the true symbols to estimate the channel condition, it is shown based on at-sea data that long packets of data can be transmitted with minimal errors even in harsh environments where the channel coherence time is very short (a fraction of the packet length).","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151827","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05151827.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Toward continuous underwater acoustic communications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5151827/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747838","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5151827/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward continuous underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080509-005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053496S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5151827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5151841,"authors":[{"name":"Paul van Walree","affiliation":["TNO Underwater Technology Group, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"van Walree","id":"37568522900"},{"name":"Erland Sangfelt","affiliation":["Swedish Defence Research Agency, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erland","lastName":"Sangfelt","id":"37389579000"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2619-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2620-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5151841","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":403},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5151841","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Equalizers","Frequency","Modems","Sonar equipment","Filters","Acoustic testing","Bandwidth","Turbo codes","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","hydrophones","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters","spread spectrum communication","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier spread spectrum","covert acoustic communications","multicarrier modulation","single bit sequence","multichannel equalizer","multiband equalizer","feedforward filters","Baltic Sea","adaptive combiner","turbo coding","acoustic modem","transmitter","hydrophone","direct sequence spread spectrum","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151841","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05151841.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicarrier spread spectrum for Covert Acoustic Communications","abstract":"A multicarrier modulation scheme is presented to achieve the objective of clandestine acoustic communications. The modulation consists of a single bit sequence simultaneously modulated onto multiple carriers. As all bands carry the same symbol stream, they can be adaptively combined with a multi-channel equalizer. A multiband equalizer with K feedforward filters is thus devised for joint equalization and despreading of K frequency bands. The idea is tested on acoustic data collected during sea experiments in the Baltic Sea. Eight carriers were used to divide the available bandwidth up into K = 8 binary phaseshift keyed bands of 460 Hz each. Covert operation at low SNR is enabled by the spread-spectrum gain delivered by the adaptive combiner, a rate-1/3 turbo coding scheme, and through the use of periodic training. Results are shown for three experiments over ranges of 8, 28, and 52 km, using a prototype acoustic modem as the transmitter and a hydrophone at the receiving end. Both the modem and the hydrophone were lowered into the Baltic sound channel from surface ships. At an effective data rate of 75 bit/s, the user message is correctly recovered at SNRs down to -12 dB under various multipath conditions. A comparison is made with two other modulations, direct-sequence spread spectrum and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. These signals were broadcast during the same experiments, in the same frequency band, and at the same data rate. The proposed multicarrier scheme compares favorably with the other modulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5151841/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10734590","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5151841/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier spread spectrum for Covert Acoustic Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier spread spectrum for Covert Acoustic Communications","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080512-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089769S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5151841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5151860,"authors":[{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"},{"name":"Paul van Walree","affiliation":["TNO, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"van Walree","id":"37568522900"},{"name":"Jeroen Boschma","affiliation":["TNO, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Boschma","id":"38557313000"},{"name":"Claudio Fanciullacci","affiliation":["Teleport Eutelsat, France"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Fanciullacci","id":"38556579400"},{"name":"Hans Gerritsen","affiliation":["Moog FCS, Nieuw-Vennep, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Gerritsen","id":"38556726800"},{"name":"Paolo Tusoni","affiliation":["Value Team, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Tusoni","id":"38559475300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2619-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2620-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5151860","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater communication","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM modulation","Underwater acoustics","Decoding","Acoustic noise","Working environment noise","Phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio receivers","underwater acoustic telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covert underwater communications","multiband OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","covert acoustic telemetry","radio receiver","time varying environment","data transfer"]}],"abstract":"We consider the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for covert acoustic telemetry.

Basis expansion model (BEM) is an approximation of the time-varying channel with a parsimonious set of BEM coefficients, which facilitates coherent and differential schemes resilient to doubly selectivity of UAC channels. Different BEMs not only approximate the channels with different accuracy levels, but also induce different effects on the model fitting bias and the additive noise. In this paper, we will first show how our previously proposed coherent and differential schemes based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) BEM can be modified to accommodate other BEMs. We will then analyze the tradeoff between the channel modeling accuracy and bias/noise effect. Our analyses, simulations and experiment results confirm that BEM is a powerful tool in UAC. Additionally, in the choice among various BEM options, not only the modeling accuracy has to be considered, the nature of the model fitting bias and the noise effect also have to be taken into account.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05151896.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5151896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basis expansion model for underwater acoustic channels?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Discrete Fourier transforms","Time-varying channels","Decision feedback equalizers","Underwater communication","Frequency domain analysis","Analytical models","Acoustic signal detection","Data communication","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","discrete Fourier transforms","matrix inversion","time-varying channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication channel","time-varying channel","BEM","basis expansion model","differential scheme","UAC channel","model fitting bias","additive noise","discrete Fourier transform","inverse DFT matrix","approximation scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5151896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Basis expansion model for underwater acoustic channels?","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5151896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747868","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basis expansion model for underwater acoustic channels?","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080514-023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060637S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5151896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5151903,"authors":[{"name":"Knut Grythe","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Knut","lastName":"Grythe","id":"37568547000"},{"name":"Jan Erik Hakegard","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Jan Erik","lastName":"Hakegard","id":"37568537800"},{"name":"Tor Andre Myrvoll","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Tor Andre","lastName":"Myrvoll","id":"38242935900"},{"name":"Tor Arne Reinen","affiliation":["SINTEF ICT, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Tor Arne","lastName":"Reinen","id":"37545313400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2619-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2620-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5151903","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic propagation","Acoustic measurements","Sea measurements","MIMO","Acoustic transducers","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Frequency measurement","Sea surface","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Trondheim harbour","acoustic propagation measurements","communication capacity","MIMO channel","sound velocity profile measurements","Doppler spread","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents results from a propagation measurement campaign carried out in the Trondheim harbour during the period from June to November 2007. Two vertically mounted transducers operating at a carrier frequency of 38 kHz permitted both single-input/single-output (SISO) and multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channel measurements. The upper transducers at both sides were mounted around 2 meters from the sea surface. The sound velocity profile measurements showed large variations in the upper layers of the water column during the campaign period. Due to the fixed mechanical transducer constructions, the observed Doppler spread was low. The Delay spread however varied from 0.5 ms in the summer up to 9 ms in November. The calculated spatial multiplexing capacity within a 3 kHz bandwidth of the MIMO topology gave a factor in the order of 1.8 capacity improvement compared to derived SISO capabilities. The reference SISO propagation channels used in the calculations were one of the estimated elements of the corresponding MIMO channel matrices. Channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter maximises the capacity, particularly at low signal to noise (SNR) rations. Simulations comparing capacities achieved with and without transmitter CSI are shown. The results show that for the observed channels, spatial multiplexing MIMO capacity outperforms SISO and verified that CSI is beneficial at decreasing SNR values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Trondheim harbour: Acoustic propagation measurements and communication capacity","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151903","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05151903.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5151903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5151903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5151903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Trondheim harbour: Acoustic propagation measurements and communication capacity","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5151903/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747872","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Trondheim harbour: Acoustic propagation measurements and communication capacity","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080514-032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083749S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5151903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5151953,"authors":[{"name":"Patricia Ceballos Carrascosa","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Patricia Ceballos","lastName":"Carrascosa","id":"37545905900"},{"name":"Milica Stojanovic","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37266493500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2619-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2620-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5151953","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Acoustic signal detection","Adaptive signal detection","Underwater tracking","OFDM","Signal detection","Underwater acoustics","Transmitters","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","channel coding","channel estimation","correlation methods","Doppler effect","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","signal detection","space division multiplexing","synchronisation","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signal detection","underwater acoustic channel","frequency correlation","time correlation","adaptive channel estimation algorithm","MIMO spatial multiplexing","nonuniform Doppler compensation","adaptive synchronization method","multiple transmitter","shallow water channel","error-free performance","BCH","QPSK","encoding"]}],"abstract":"Frequency and time correlation of the underwater channel are exploited to obtain an adaptive channel estimation algorithm for MIMO spatial multiplexing with low complexity and low overhead.

In this scheme, each received packet is artificially partitioned into blocks for processing. The MIMO channel is initially estimated using training blocks at the front of transmitted packets from all transducers. With the estimated MIMO channel, one data block following the training blocks is equalized. The phase rotation in the equalized data block is compensated by a group-wise phase correction operation, before symbol detection. The newly detected data block along with K - 1 previous data (or pilot) blocks are utilized to re-estimate the channel, which is employed to equalize the next new data block. The block-wise processing procedure is repeated until all blocks in the received packet are processed and demodulated.

high-bandwidth optical communications","abstract":"High speed underwater optical communications has at least three distinct advantages over acoustic communications. The data rates achievable are high (1 to 10 Mbps), the latency from when data is sent to when data is received is low, and there is no acoustic noise associated with transmission. Of course one of the biggest limitations of an optical approach underwater is the rapid attenuation of optical signals due to spreading loss, scattering, and absorption. Nonetheless, communication signals have been broadcast, received, and decoded over distances of 100 to 200 meters. High data rates and low latency make optical communications an attractive human interface to underwater systems, such as wireless control of underwater vehicles. Underwater optical communications is generally well-suited to multiple platform environments, where acoustic silence and limited range avoids interference between platforms. High data rates are advantageous in data retrieval applications, where, for one example, wireless data retrieval would make deployment and recovery of certain systems more economical. Recent engineering developments and accompanying experimental data are put forth in this paper, and the implications for future development are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5151977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5151977/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10747915","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Diffuse high-bandwidth optical communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffuse high-bandwidth optical communications","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080515-079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059712S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5151977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5151992,"authors":[{"name":"William C.

The proposed approach relies on passive time reversal for multichannel combining of observed waveforms at an array of sensors prior to OFDM processing, which produces an equivalent channel with a shorter impulse response that can be handled much more easily. A method for tracking the narrowband residual phase variations of the channel after Doppler preprocessing is proposed. This is a variation of an existing technique that can improve the spectral efficiency of OFDM by reducing the need for pilot symbols.

Most AUVs available commercially tend to be complex and very expensive. With advances in recent technology, sensors with new functionality or lower cost substitutes have become available. Most existing AUV platforms do not facilitate easy integration of new or upgraded sensors. A solution to this problem is to have a modular AUV system with changeable payload sections capable of carrying different sensor to suite different missions. Modular AUVs are exceptionally useful in group mission scenarios with different AUVs carrying different sensor payloads. By having a team of modular AUVs, payloads can be easily interchanged between the AUVs to configure the team for various missions. Modular AUVs require their sections to be electrically and mechanically compatible with one another. In this paper we describe the detailed architecture of the electronics system for STARFISH AUV. The benefits of modular hardware and its advantages in developing and integrating newer sensor payloads with the base AUV are shown. The modular electronics system for STARFISH AUV has been implemented and currently being tested.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152050","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05152050.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152050","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware architecture for a modular autonomous underwater vehicle STARFISH","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware architecture for a modular autonomous underwater vehicle STARFISH","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152050/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152050/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747955","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware architecture for a modular autonomous underwater vehicle STARFISH","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080515-172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06456S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5152050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5152056,"authors":[{"name":"Baosheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Baosheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37559017500"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407359000"},{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854700"},{"name":"Keenan Ball","affiliation":["Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Keenan","lastName":"Ball","id":"37395607800"},{"name":"Milica Stojanovic","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37266493500"},{"name":"Lee Freitag","affiliation":["Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Freitag","id":"37370518400"},{"name":"Peter Willett","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Willett","id":"37268359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2619-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2620-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"5152056","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":595},"abstract":"MIMO-OFDM is one viable solution for high data rate transmissions over underwater acoustic channels.

Underwater acoustic channels are wideband in nature due to the fact that the signal transmission bandwidth is comparable to the carrier frequency. Furthermore, these channels are characterized by long delay spreads, sparsity and time variation. The time-variation challenges the use of OFDM - destroying carrier orthogonality and introducing significant inter carrier interference. Much of the current work on time varying channels assumes a single common Doppler shift for each path. As such, resampling is optimal preprocessing in such cases. The current work examines the choice of resampling factor for the case of distinct Doppler shift on each path. The optimal resampling factor is selected to maximize the Fisher information for the transmitted data; Fisher information is also used to evaluate the information loss due to resampling. The findings suggest that the optimal resampling factor is near that associated with the Doppler shift of the strongest path. It is also observed that the information loss is modest in many cases using this practical preprocessing.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05152064.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal resampling for OFDM signaling in doubly-selective underwater acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater acoustics","Doppler shift","OFDM modulation","Bandwidth","Underwater communication","Signal processing","Wideband","Intersymbol interference","Frequency division multiplexing","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","OFDM modulation","signal sampling","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal resampling","OFDM signaling","underwater acoustic channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","signal transmission","carrier frequency","Doppler shift"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On optimal resampling for OFDM signaling in doubly-selective underwater acoustic channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152064/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747962","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal resampling for OFDM signaling in doubly-selective underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080516-013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051471S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5152064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5152065,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy F.

Along with allowing both teleoperated and autonomous CTD profiling capability, this system was deployed as part of a small fleet of similar ASCs equipped with acoustic modem hardware and linked via 802.11b wireless Ethernet and evolution data, optimized (EVDO) to the ship and the Internet. Using this communications capability, the fleet of autonomous vehicles automatically uploaded oceanographic data to a remote server and remained in contact with scientists aboard the nearby research vessel. The uploaded data was nearly immediately available to the ocean modeling and prediction model maintained at MIT and Harvard University.

The use of autonomous sailboats for ocean sampling has been tentatively proposed before, but there have been minor efforts towards the development and deployment of actual prototypes, due to a number of technical limitations and significant risks of operation. Currently, most of the limitations have been surpassed, with the availability of extremely low power electronics, flexible computational systems, reliable communication devices and high performance renewable power sources. At the same time, some of the major risks have been mitigated, allowing this emerging technology to become an effective tool for a wide range of applications in real scenarios. We illustrate some of these scenarios and we describe the status of the current efforts being made to develop operational prototypes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine technology","Oceans","Sampling methods","Surveillance","Prototypes","Power system reliability","Robots","Wind energy","Propulsion","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boats","remotely operated vehicles","surveillance","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous sailboat","ocean sampling","ocean surveillance","robotic vessel","wind energy","propulsion","sails control","rudder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152113","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05152113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous sailboats: An emerging technology for ocean sampling and surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous sailboats: An emerging technology for ocean sampling and surveillance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152113/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152113/","accessionNumber":"10734713","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous sailboats: An emerging technology for ocean sampling and surveillance","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080529-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058662S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5152113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5152115,"authors":[{"name":"Aijun Song","affiliation":["College of Marine and Earth Studies, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Aijun","lastName":"Song","id":"37276032900"},{"name":"Mohsen Badiey","affiliation":["College of Marine and Earth Studies, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Badiey","id":"37317396200"},{"name":"Vincent K.

In this paper, multichannel combining and decision feedback equalization (MCC/DFE) has been proposed for underwater acoustic MIMO channels. In order to overcome the difficulties introduced by the fast fluctuating channel, Doppler tracking and frequent channel estimation are performed. Then time reversal combining followed by a single channel DFE is used to demodulate individual symbol sequences transmitted by the multiple element source. To improve the performance, successive interference cancellation is also incorporated into the receiver structure. Using data from the Makai experiment conducted around Kauai Island, HI, 2005, we have shown that the achievable data rate can be increased up to 4 times using the same bandwidth as single source systems. For example, 32 kilobits/s could have been achieved by simultaneous transmission of four 4 kilosymbols/s 4-phase shift keying (QPSK) symbol sequences when both the source and the receiver were drifting at a 2 km range in the ocean.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152115","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089336/5151799/05152115.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5151799","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel combining and equalization for underwater acoustic MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel combining and equalization for underwater acoustic MIMO channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152115/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10747993","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5152115/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel combining and equalization for underwater acoustic MIMO channels","confLoc":"Quebec City, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"080529-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068971S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5089336","isNumber":"5151799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089336","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5151799","articleId":"5152115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5152148,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37292516400"},{"name":"Thinh Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Thinh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37293066800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4651-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4652-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-969X"}],"articleNumber":"5152148","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Hidden Markov models","Streaming media","Scheduling algorithm","Computational modeling","State feedback","Dynamic programming","Processor scheduling","Wireless networks","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","encoding","hidden Markov models","media streaming","scheduling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding-based wireless media transmission","POMDP","packet scheduling","multimedia transmission","access point","802.11 network","hidden Markov model","partially observable Markov decision process","simulation-based dynamic programming algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless multimedia streaming","network coding","scheduling","simulation-based algorithms","hidden Markov model","partially observable Markov decision process"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of joint network coding and packet scheduling for multimedia transmission from the Access Point (AP) to multiple receivers in 802.11 networks.

We propose a rate model and a quality model, both in terms of the quantization stepsize and frame rate. The quality model is derived from our earlier quality model in terms of the PSNR of decoded frames and frame rate. Both models are developed based on the key observation from experimental data that the relative reduction of either rate and quality when the frame rate decreases is quite independent of the quantization stepsize. This observation enables us to express both rate and quality as the product of separate functions of quantization stepsize and frame rate, respectively. The proposed rate and quality models are analytically tractable, each requiring only two content-dependent parameters. Both models fit the measured data very accurately, with high Pearson correlation. We further apply these models for rate-constrained bitstream adaptation, where the problem is to determine the optimal combination of quality and temporal layers that provides the highest perceptual quality for a given bandwidth constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling rate and perceptual quality of scalable video as functions of quantization and frame rate and its application in scalable video adaptation","publicationTitle":"2009 17th International Packet Video Workshop","doi":"10.1109/PACKET.2009.5152161","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 17th International Packet Video Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089938/5152141/05152161.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACKET.2009.5152161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling rate and perceptual quality of scalable video as functions of quantization and frame rate and its application in scalable video adaptation","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152161/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10734741","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling rate and perceptual quality of scalable video as functions of quantization and frame rate and its application in scalable video adaptation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077982S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089938","isNumber":"5152141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089938","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5152141","articleId":"5152161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5152204,"authors":[{"name":"Bram Vanderborght","affiliation":["Robotics & Multibody Mechanics Research Group Pleinlaan 2, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","Robotics, Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department, Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Vanderborght","id":"37295389300"},{"name":"Nikos G.

The actuator has a large joint angle, torque and stiffness range and these properties can be made beneficial for safe human robot interaction and the construction of energy efficient walking, hopping and running robots. The ability to store and release energy is shown by simulations on a 1DOF hopping robot.

RANSAM exploits the theory of the birthday attack whose mathematical background is known from cryptography. The RANSAM technique can be applied to various fields of application such as mobile robotics, computer vision, and medical robotics. Since standard computers feature multi-core processors nowadays, a considerable speedup can be obtained by distributing selected subtasks of RANSAM among the available cores. First of all this paper addresses the parallelization of the RANSAM approach. Several important characteristics are derived from a probabilistic point of view. Moreover, we apply a fuzzy criterion to compute the matching quality, which is an important step towards real-time capability. The algorithm has been implemented for Windows and for the QNX RTOS.

Assuming that the forward velocity is separately set to a desired value, the proposed control approach ensures terrain following and guaranties the vehicle does not collide with the ground during the task. The proposed control acquires an optical flow from three spatially separate observation points, typically obtained via three cameras or three non collinear directions in a unique camera.

The focus is on the control approach and on the movement of the rope connecting helicopters and load. The proposed approach is based on two control loops: an outer loop to control the translation of each helicopter in compound and an inner loop to control the orientation of helicopters. The challenge here is that in both loops the dynamics of the whole system - all helicopters and load - should be accounted for. It is shown, that for designing the outer loop controller a complex model of the helicopters and load can be replaced by a simplified model based on interconnected mass points. For designing the inner loop controller, the complete dynamics of the whole system are considered. The usage of force sensors in the ropes is proposed in order to simplify the inner loop controller and to make it robust against variations of system parameters. The presented inner loop controller is independent of the number of coupled helicopters. The outer loop controller depends on the number of helicopters. The problem of oscillations in the flexible ropes due to external disturbancies (e.g. wind gusts) is discussed and a solution based on load state observer is presented. The performance of the presented system was verified in simulations and in real flight experiments with one and three helicopters transporting the load. The worldwide first demonstration of a slung load transportation using three helicopters was performed in December 2007.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152382/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10748868","publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152382/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generic slung load transportation system using small size helicopters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic slung load transportation system using small size helicopters","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059797S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5152385,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Pastor","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37542415600"},{"name":"Heiko Hoffmann","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37583638900"},{"name":"Tamim Asfour","affiliation":["University of Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tamim","lastName":"Asfour","id":"37295529100"},{"name":"Stefan Schaal","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schaal","id":"37282144700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152385","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":329,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3802},"abstract":"We provide a general approach for learning robotic motor skills from human demonstration. To represent an observed movement, a non-linear differential equation is learned such that it reproduces this movement. Based on this representation, we build a library of movements by labeling each recorded movement according to task and context (e.g., grasping, placing, and releasing). Our differential equation is formulated such that generalization can be achieved simply by adapting a start and a goal parameter in the equation to the desired position values of a movement. For object manipulation, we present how our framework extends to the control of gripper orientation and finger position. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in simulation as well as on the Sarcos dextrous robot arm. The robot learned a pick-and-place operation and a water-serving task and could generalize these tasks to novel situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152385.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"768","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and generalization of motor skills by learning from demonstration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Differential equations","Libraries","Humans","Grippers","Fingers","Robustness","Robotics and automation","Labeling","Anthropomorphism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning and generalization of motor skills by learning from demonstration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and generalization of motor skills by learning from demonstration","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045581S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"329","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5152392,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Oates","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Oates","id":"37572101900"},{"name":"Michael Milford","affiliation":["The School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","The Queensland Brain Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Milford","id":"37283633100"},{"name":"Gordon Wyeth","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Wyeth","id":"37283635700"},{"name":"Graham Kendall","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Graham","lastName":"Kendall","id":"37276281000"},{"name":"Jonathan M.

We present a novel security system that uses metrics generated by the localisation algorithm to perform adaptive anomaly detection. The localisation algorithm is a vision-based SLAM solution called RatSLAM, based on mechanisms within the hippocampus. The anomaly detection algorithm is based on the mechanisms used by the immune system to identify threats to the body. The system is explored using data gathered within an unmodified office environment. It is shown that the algorithm successfully reacts to the presence of people and objects in areas where they are not usually present and is tolerised against the presence of people in environments that are usually dynamic.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152392","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152392.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The implementation of a novel, bio-inspired, robotic security system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152392/","displayDocTitle":"The implementation of a novel, bio-inspired, robotic security system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152392/","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The implementation of a novel, bio-inspired, robotic security system","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061819S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5152394,"authors":[{"name":"Hian Kai Kwa","affiliation":["Florida Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Pensacola, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Hian Kai Kwa","id":"37087838351"},{"name":"Jerryll H.

Additionally, a distributed Conjugate Gradient algorithm is employed that reduces the cost of computing the MAP estimates, while utilizing all available resources in the team and increasing robustness to single-point failures. Finally, a computationally efficient distributed marginalization of past robot poses is introduced for limiting the size of the optimization problem. The communication and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is described in detail, while extensive simulation studies are presented for validating the performance of the distributed MAP estimator and comparing its accuracy to that of existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152398","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152398.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed maximum a posteriori estimation for multi-robot cooperative localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed maximum a posteriori estimation for multi-robot cooperative localization","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5152398/","accessionNumber":"10749191","publicationDate":"May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed maximum a posteriori estimation for multi-robot cooperative localization","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084153S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152399,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitry Berenson","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Berenson","id":"37542925700"},{"name":"Siddhartha S.

CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to find bridges between them.

We show that WGRs provide a common framework for describing goal regions that are useful for grasping and manipulation. We also describe two randomized planning algorithms capable of planning with WGRs. The first is an extension of RRT-JT that interleaves exploration using a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) with exploitation using Jacobian-based gradient descent toward WGR samples. The second is the IKBiRRT algorithm, which uses a forward-searching tree rooted at the start and a backward-searching tree that is seeded by WGR samples.

Two important technologies are described: a motion generation and a balance control. The motion generation is a unified way to design both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses the measured orientation of the robot's torso used in the motion generation as an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid robot that can run forward at 7.0 [km/h] is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152404","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152404.pdf","startPage":"1571","endPage":"1576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast running experiments involving a humanoid robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast running experiments involving a humanoid robot","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152404/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152404/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast running experiments involving a humanoid robot","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040086S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152423,"authors":[{"name":"Heiko Hoffmann","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"37583638900"},{"name":"Peter Pastor","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37542415600"},{"name":"Dae-Hyung Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Dae-Hyung","lastName":"Park","id":"37575779200"},{"name":"Stefan Schaal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schaal","id":"37282144700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152423","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":135,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Humans","Robot kinematics","Differential equations","Orbital robotics","Humanoid robots","Prosthetics","Robustness","Force measurement","Robotics and automation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically-inspired dynamical systems for movement generation: Automatic real-time goal adaptation and obstacle avoidance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152423","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152423","startPage":"2587","endPage":"2592","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","abstract":"Dynamical systems can generate movement trajectories that are robust against perturbations. This article presents an improved modification of the original dynamic movement primitive (DMP) framework by Ijspeert et al [1], [2]. The new equations can generalize movements to new targets without singularities and large accelerations. Furthermore, the new equations can represent a movement in 3D task space without depending on the choice of coordinate system (invariance under invertible affine transformations). Our modified DMP is motivated from biological data (spinal-cord stimulation in frogs) and human behavioral experiments. We further extend the formalism to obstacle avoidance by exploiting the robustness against perturbations: an additional term is added to the differential equations to make the robot steer around an obstacle. This additional term empirically describes human obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the Sarcos Slave robot arm: after learning a single placing movement, the robot placed a cup between two arbitrarily given positions and avoided approaching obstacles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152423/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Biologically-inspired dynamical systems for movement generation: Automatic real-time goal adaptation and obstacle avoidance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically-inspired dynamical systems for movement generation: Automatic real-time goal adaptation and obstacle avoidance","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058398S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5152440,"authors":[{"name":"Volkmar Eichhorn","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Volkmar","lastName":"Eichhorn","id":"38532683400"},{"name":"Sergej Fatikow","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sergej","lastName":"Fatikow","id":"37268086600"},{"name":"Tim Wortmann","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Wortmann","id":"37546513100"},{"name":"Christian Stolle","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Stolle","id":"37644630400"},{"name":"Christoph Edeler","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Edeler","id":"37681820300"},{"name":"Daniel Jasper","affiliation":["Division Micro Robotics and Control Engineering, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Jasper","id":"37571915600"},{"name":"Ozlem Sardan","affiliation":["DTU Nanotech, Department of Micro and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ozlem","lastName":"Sardan","id":"37300107600"},{"name":"Peter Boggild","affiliation":["DTU Nanotech, Department of Micro and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Boggild","id":"37322710600"},{"name":"Guillaume Boetsch","affiliation":["Robotic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Boetsch","id":"37088626983"},{"name":"Christophe Canales","affiliation":["Robotic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Canales","id":"37088627183"},{"name":"Reymond Clavel","affiliation":["Robotic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Reymond","lastName":"Clavel","id":"37277398200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152440","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrothermal effects","Grippers","Carbon nanotubes","Organic materials","Nanostructured materials","Large-scale systems","Production systems","Prototypes","Electron mobility","Scanning electron microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","electronics industry","grippers","micromanipulators","nanoelectronics","scanning electron microscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NanoLab","nanorobotic system","automated pick-and-place handling","carbon nanotubes","nanoelectronic applications","large-scale production","electrothermal microgrippers","mobile microrobots","scanning electron microscope","electrical characterization"]}],"abstract":"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most promising materials for nanoelectronic applications.

In this paper, we introduce a new approach called expansion segmentation, which simultaneously detects \u201ccollision danger regions\u201d of significant positive divergence in inertial aided video, and estimates maximum likelihood time to collision (TTC) in a correspondenceless framework within the danger regions. This approach was motivated from a literature review which showed that existing approaches make strong assumptions about scene structure or camera motion, or pose collision detection without determining obstacle boundaries, both of which limit the operational envelope of a deployable system. Expansion segmentation is based on a new formulation of 6-DOF inertial aided TTC estimation, and a new derivation of a first order TTC uncertainty model due to subpixel quantization error and epipolar geometry uncertainty. Proof of concept results are shown in a custom designed urban flight simulator and on operational flight data from a small air vehicle.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152487","startPage":"875","endPage":"882","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152487.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expansion segmentation for visual collision detection and estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152487/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Expansion segmentation for visual collision detection and estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152487/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expansion segmentation for visual collision detection and estimation","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075296S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":5152495,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Granstrom","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Granstrom","id":"37571611600"},{"name":"Jonas Callmer","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Callmer","id":"37546508800"},{"name":"Fabio Ramos","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Ramos","id":"37285364500"},{"name":"Juan Nieto","affiliation":["Australian Centre of Field Robotics, University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Nieto","id":"37085778635"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152495","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":501},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simultaneous localization and mapping","Large-scale systems","Robustness","Information resources","Robot sensing systems","Machine learning","Boosting","Machine learning algorithms","Feature extraction","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loop closure detection","range data","simultaneous localisation and mapping","SLAM","range sensors","machine learning","binary classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152495","abstract":"Despite significant developments in the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem, loop closure detection is still challenging in large scale unstructured environments. Current solutions rely on heuristics that lack generalisation properties, in particular when range sensors are the only source of information about the robot's surrounding environment. This paper presents a machine learning approach for the loop closure detection problem using range sensors. A binary classifier based on boosting is used to detect loop closures. The algorithm performs robustly, even under potential occlusions and significant changes in rotation and translation. We developed a number of features, extracted from range data, that are invariant to rotation. Additionally, we present a general framework for scan-matching SLAM in outdoor environments. Experimental results in large scale urban environments show the robustness of the approach, with a detection rate of 85% and a false alarm rate of only 1%. The proposed algorithm can be computed in real-time and achieves competitive performance with no manual specification of thresholds given the features.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152495","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152495.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to detect loop closure from range data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning to detect loop closure from range data","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152495/","accessionNumber":"10749149","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152495/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to detect loop closure from range data","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054266S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5152496,"authors":[{"name":"N.G.

The planning software is separated into sequentially executed planning and registration procedures. An optimal setup is first planned in virtual reality and then adapted to variations in the operating room. The real time control system is structured in hierarchical layers. Functions are arranged in the layers with respect to their domain and maximum response time. The design is flexible and expandable while performance is maintained. Structure, functionality and implementation of planning and control are described. The prototypic robotic system provides intuitive bimanual bilateral teleoperation within the planned working space.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152512","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152512.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","startPage":"4225","endPage":"4232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning and control of a teleoperation system for research in minimally invasive robotic surgery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Planning and control of a teleoperation system for research in minimally invasive robotic surgery","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152512/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749076","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5152512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning and control of a teleoperation system for research in minimally invasive robotic surgery","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"0868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067956S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5152516,"authors":[{"name":"David Gouaillier","affiliation":["Engineering System Laboratory, University of Versailles, Velizy, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gouaillier","id":"37294654300"},{"name":"Vincent Hugel","affiliation":["Engineering System Laboratory, University of Versailles, Velizy, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Hugel","id":"37294135300"},{"name":"Pierre Blazevic","affiliation":["Engineering System Laboratory, University of Versailles, Velizy, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Blazevic","id":"37294760500"},{"name":"Chris Kilner","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Kilner","id":"37571597600"},{"name":"Jerome Monceaux","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Monceaux","id":"37571597200"},{"name":"Pascal Lafourcade","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Lafourcade","id":"38521991200"},{"name":"Brice Marnier","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Brice","lastName":"Marnier","id":"37571594700"},{"name":"Julien Serre","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Serre","id":"37585215800"},{"name":"Bruno Maisonnier","affiliation":["Aldebaran Robotics, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Maisonnier","id":"37571593000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152516","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":286,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2757},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152516","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mechatronics","Humanoid robots","Kinematics","Guidelines","Infrared sensors","Robotics and automation","Pelvis","Brushes","DC motors","Distributed computing"]}],"abstract":"This article presents the mechatronic design of the autonomous humanoid robot called NAO that is built by the French company Aldebaran-Robotics.

This paper proposes a novel method to bias sampling by means of geometric constraints that reduces the sampling space to sets of lower dimensional submanifolds. These constraints may be imposed by the kinematic structure of the actuation system, by the task specification, or provided by a human user as an intuitive way to include problem knowledge to the planner. The method has been implemented and tested on a probabilistic roadmap planner giving promising results.

However, these two questions have been difficult to answer, even when adaptive methods meant to facilitate a solution are applied. For example, adaptive solutions such as setting learning rates, hand-classifying spaces, and defining parameters for a library of planners have all been proposed. We demonstrate a strategy based on unsupervised learning methods that makes adaptive planning more practical. The unsupervised strategies require less user intervention, model the topology of the problem in a reasonable and efficient manner, can adapt the sampler depending on characteristics of the problem, and can easily accept new samplers as they become available. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that in a wide variety of environments, the regions automatically identified by our technique represent the planning space well both in number and placement.

This paper reflects on four existing control algorithms for the task of level ground walking, and then presents theory and test results of a novel control algorithm based on phase plane invariants.

A visual stimulation process elicits the neurological phenomenon and the EEG signal processing detects the target area. This target area represents a location that is given to the autonomous navigation system, which drives the wheelchair to the desired place while avoiding collisions with the obstacles detected by the laser scanner. The accuracy of the brain-computer interface is above 94% and the flexibility of the sensor-based motion system allows for navigation in non-prepared and populated scenarios. The prototype has been validated with five healthy subjects in three experimental sessions: screening (an analysis of three different interfaces and its implications on the performance of the users), virtual environment driving (training and instruction of the users) and driving sessions with the wheelchair (driving tests along pre-established circuits). On the basis of the results, this paper reports a technical evaluation of the device and a variability study.

Aside from convergence, the fulfillment of additional important criteria can be assessed, e.g. the target visibility, the avoidance of actuators' saturations, and the guarantee of 3D constraints. The field of nonlinear \"rational\" systems is first shown to constitute a sound and versatile framework to the problem.

From the control standpoint, it is possible to increase this level of safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never exhibit any unstable behaviour. However, stability is not the only concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction. The first characteristic is provided by the design of a stability observer while the other is based on a variable admittance control scheme that uses the force derivative as a way to predict human intention. The stability observer is based on a previous stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder and from a multi-axis force sensor at the end effector is also provided. The stability and intuitivity of the control law were verified in a user study during a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel robot.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Safety","Admittance","Motion control","Impedance","Robotics and automation","Human robot interaction","Force sensors","Service robots","Humanoid robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152664","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152664","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152664.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152664","startPage":"3383","endPage":"3388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safe, Stable and Intuitive Control for Physical Human-Robot Interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Safe, Stable and Intuitive Control for Physical Human-Robot Interaction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152664/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152664/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe, Stable and Intuitive Control for Physical Human-Robot Interaction","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04042S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152680,"authors":[{"name":"Spencer Ahrens","affiliation":["Aerospace Controls Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Spencer","lastName":"Ahrens","id":"37568759900"},{"name":"Daniel Levine","affiliation":["Aerospace Controls Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Levine","id":"37583312800"},{"name":"Gregory Andrews","affiliation":["Inc. 555 Technology Square, Charles Stark Draper Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Andrews","id":"37579622300"},{"name":"Jonathan P.

Even if these controllers operate with satisfactory nominal tracking performance, considerable attention has been focused on appropriate control strategies to compensate hysteresis, nonlinearities, drift and creep for high bandwidths and large scanning regimes. As these closed-loop controllers are very cost-effective, a special interest in robust plug-in compensators seems to be a solution. We proposed in this paper a robust plug-in compensator using the H-infinity loop-shaping techniques which can be plugged into the existing controller without affecting the already satisfactory nominal tracking performance of the existing closed-loop system. Dynamic modeling, identification and robust control of a 3 d.o.f. piezoelectric nanorobotic positioner are presented in this paper in order to improve the nanorobot performance under plant parameter variations and in the presence of external disturbances. Simulation and experimental results are given to validate the proposed plug-in robust compensator in the case of a nanorobotic manipulation task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> robustification control of existing piezoelectric-stack actuated nanomanipulators","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152701","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152701.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> robustification control of existing piezoelectric-stack actuated nanomanipulators","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152701/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749197","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> robustification control of existing piezoelectric-stack actuated nanomanipulators","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057748S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152702,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyasu Iwata","affiliation":["Waseda Institute for Advanced Study, Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyasu","lastName":"Iwata","id":"37326645800"},{"name":"Shigeki Sugano","affiliation":["Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering, School of Creative Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Sugano","id":"37274050800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152702","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":158,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2487},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Symbiosis","Robots","Senior citizens","Safety","Layout","Manipulators","Anthropomorphism","Skin","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","humanoid robots","human-robot interaction","manipulators","mobile robots","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human symbiotic robot design","TWENDY-ONE robot","kitchen support robot","physical support","dexterity function","mobility function","compact passive mechanism","anthropomorphic dual hand","omni-wheeled vehicle","elderly person physical support"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a sophisticated design of human symbiotic robots that provide physical supports to the elderly such as attendant care with high-power and kitchen supports with dexterity while securing contact safety even if physical contact occurs with them.

In addition, we set task scenes in daily life where support by robot is useful for old women living alone, in order to deduce specifications for the robot. Based on them, we successfully developed a new generation of human symbiotic robot, TWENDY-ONE that has a head, trunk, dual arms with a compact passive mechanism, anthropomorphic dual hands with mechanical softness in joints and skins and an omni-wheeled vehicle.

Using this database, we demonstrate a novel grasp planning algorithm that exploits geometric similarity between a 3D model and the objects in the database to synthesize form closure grasps.

The robot is unable to access precise information regarding position coordinates, angular coordinates, time, or odometry, but is nevertheless able to navigate itself to a goal among unknown piecewise-analytic obstacles in the plane. The only sensor providing real values is an intensity sensor, which measures the signal strength emanating from the goal. The signal intensity function may or may not be symmetric; the main requirement is that the level sets are concentric images of simple closed curves, i.e. topological circles.

Though these maps are able to produce 3D models of the environment while exploiting the computational feasibility of single elevation maps, they do not take into account in-plane uncertainty when matching measurements to grid cells or when grouping those measurements into dasiapatches.psila To respond to these drawbacks, this paper proposes to extend these ML surface maps into Probabilistic Multi-Level (PML) surface maps, which uses formal probability theory to incorporate estimation and modeling errors due to uncertainty. Measurements are probabilistically associated to cells near the nominal location, and are categorized through hypothesis testing into dasiapatchespsila via classification methods that incorporate uncertainty. Experimental results comparing the performances of the PML and ML surface mapping algorithms on representative objects found in both indoor and outdoor environments show that the PML algorithm outperforms the ML algorithm in most cases including in the presence of noisy and sparse measurements. The experimental results support the claim that the PML algorithm produces more densely populated, conservative representations of its environment with fewer measurements than the ML algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152767","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1648","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152767.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic estimation of Multi-Level terrain maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic estimation of Multi-Level terrain maps","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152767/","accessionNumber":"10748762","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152767/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic estimation of Multi-Level terrain maps","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09928S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5152770,"authors":[{"name":"Jnaneshwar Das","affiliation":["Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory and Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Jnaneshwar","lastName":"Das","id":"37529624800"},{"name":"Gaurav S.

Details on the fabrication as well as basic design and analyses methods are given. These techniques are then employed to fabricate an example structure that is subsequently integrated with a microfluidic channel. The eventual purpose of this example structure would be to serve as an interface between a microfluidic device and its environment, using a brush-like structure to sweep cells into the channel, which could then be delivered to another microfluidic system for analyses of the cells. The resulting brush-like structure fits within a 6 mm times 4 mm times 2 mm volume and can be further miniaturized. The alteration of compressed air and vacuum modulated by pneumatic solenoid valves is used to push and pull a plunger/rod system that actuates the device. The delivery of the pressurized air and vacuum is accomplished through flexible 500 mum-diameter tubing to the plunger/rod system but future work would involve completely containing the actuation on a chip-size device.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152783","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152783","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152783.pdf","startPage":"2599","endPage":"2604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Robots","Microfluidics","Lab-on-a-chip","Vacuum systems","Lithography","Fabrication","Design methodology","Solenoids","Valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","microrobots","rapid prototyping (industrial)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapidly prototyped robotic structures","microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices","rapid prototyping method","photolithography","brush-like structure","pneumatic solenoid valves","pressurized air","chip-size device"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adding millimeter-sized, rapidly prototyped robotic structures to microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adding millimeter-sized, rapidly prototyped robotic structures to microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices","htmlLink":"/document/5152783/","accessionNumber":"10748892","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adding millimeter-sized, rapidly prototyped robotic structures to microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043726S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5152786,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Lim","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jongwoo","lastName":"Lim","id":"37276359500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152786","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":43,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Surface texture","Robotics and automation","USA Councils","Cameras","Computational efficiency","Robot vision systems","Pattern matching","Paints","Shape"]}],"abstract":"Stereo camera systems are widely used in many real applications including indoor and outdoor robotics. They are very easy to use and provide accurate depth estimates on well-textured scenes, but often fail when the scene does not have enough texture. It is possible to help the system work better in this situation by actively projecting certain light patterns to the scene to create artificial texture on the scene surface. The question we try to answer in ths paper is what would be the best pattern(s) to project. This paper introduces optimized projection patterns based on a novel concept of (symmetric) non-recurring De Bruijn sequences, and describes algorithms to generate such sequences. A projected pattern creates an artificial texture which does not contain any duplicate patterns over epipolar lines within certain range, thus it makes the correspondence match simple and unique. The proposed patterns are compatible with most existing stereo algorithms, meaning that they can be used without any changes in the stereo algorithm and one can immediately get much denser depth estimates without any additional computational cost. It is also argued that the proposed patterns are optimal binary patterns, and finally a few experimental result using stereo and space-time stereo algorithms are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized projection pattern supplementing stereo systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152786","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152786.pdf","startPage":"2823","endPage":"2829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimized projection pattern supplementing stereo systems","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152786/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized projection pattern supplementing stereo systems","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042932S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5152805,"authors":[{"name":"Trung-Dung Vu","affiliation":["INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Trung-Dung","lastName":"Vu","id":"37569130700"},{"name":"Olivier Aycard","affiliation":["INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Aycard","id":"37282139500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152805","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":854},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152805","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Monte Carlo methods","Laser modes","Laser theory","Vehicle detection","Vehicles","Time measurement","Motion measurement","Bayesian methods","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","optical scanners","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser-based detection","moving object tracking","data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo technique","single layer laser scanner","laser measurement sequence","moving object trajectories","sliding window","Bayesian framework"]}],"abstract":"We present a method of simultaneous detection and tracking moving objects from a moving vehicle equipped with a single layer laser scanner.

This work adopts particle filter with partitioned sampling to decompose the state space of face pose tracking into two subspaces for increasing the sampling efficiency, thus achieving satisfactory performance with fewer particles. The parameters in the first subspace describe the target on image plane, and the parameter in the second subspace is used for the estimate of the face pose in yaw angle direction. For the evaluation of each hypothesis in the second subspace, a statistical learning algorithm called relevance vector machine (RVM) is used to map a face containing image to the pose of the face. The training of RVM is tailored to each detected frontal face, and it takes less than half second, which is suitable for a real-time application. The learning based regression model also presents the insensitive ability to expression variation and unmodeled degree of freedom. The experimental results verify that the combination of particle filter and RVM can efficiently reduce the processing time and add robustness to the performance of the system, thus making this algorithm applicable to human-machine interface with low-cost webcams.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5152816/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10748842","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Real-time face tracking and pose estimation with partitioned sampling and relevance vector machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time face tracking and pose estimation with partitioned sampling and relevance vector machine","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064132S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5152817,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Ratliff","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Ratliff","id":"37579950900"},{"name":"Matt Zucker","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Zucker","id":"37547379300"},{"name":"J.

In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152817","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152817.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CHOMP: Gradient optimization techniques for efficient motion planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152817/","displayDocTitle":"CHOMP: Gradient optimization techniques for efficient motion planning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152817/","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHOMP: Gradient optimization techniques for efficient motion planning","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057967S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"376","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5152818,"authors":[{"name":"Hisashi Kanda","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Kanda","id":"37580711000"},{"name":"Tetsuya Ogata","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"},{"name":"Toru Takahashi","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37536034600"},{"name":"Kazunori Komatani","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Komatani","id":"37273821000"},{"name":"Hiroshi G.

Human infants perceive speech sounds not as discrete phoneme sequences but as continuous acoustic signals. One of critical problems in phoneme acquisition is the design for segmenting these continuous speech sounds. The key idea to solve this problem is that articulatory mechanisms such as the vocal tract help human beings to perceive speech sound units corresponding to phonemes. To segment acoustic signal with articulatory movement, we apply the segmenting method to our system by Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB). This method determines the multiple segmentation boundaries in a temporal sequence using the prediction error of the RNNPB model, and the PB values obtained by the method can be encoded as kind of phonemes. Our system was implemented by using a physical vocal tract model, called the Maeda model. Experimental results demonstrated that our system can self-organize the same phonemes in different continuous sounds, and can imitate vocal sound involving arbitrary numbers of vowels using the vowel space in the RNNPB.

This robot, the RiSE V3 climbing machine-mass 5.4 kg, length 70 cm, excluding a 28 cm tail appendage-includes several novel mechanical features, including novel linkage designs for its legs and a non-backdrivable, energy-dense power transmission to enable high-speed climbing. We summarize the robot's design and document a climbing behavior that achieves rapid ascent of a wooden telephone pole at 21 cm/s, a speed previously unachieved-and, we believe, heretofore impossible-with a robot of this scale. The behavioral gait of the robot employs the mechanical design to propel the body forward while passively maintaining yaw, pitch, and roll stability during climbing locomotion. The robot's general-purpose legged design coupled with its specialized ability to quickly gain elevation and park at a vertical station silently with minimal energy consumption suggest potential applications including search and surveillance operations as well as ad hoc networking.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Legged locomotion","Telephone poles","Tail","Couplings","Leg","Power transmission","Propulsion","Stability","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","energy consumption","legged locomotion","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrupedal robot","rapid pole climbing","legged robot","RiSE V3 climbing machine","energy-dense power transmission","behavioral robot gait","mechanical design","roll stability","minimal energy consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152830","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152830","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152830","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid pole climbing with a quadrupedal robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rapid pole climbing with a quadrupedal robot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152830/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152830/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10748784","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid pole climbing with a quadrupedal robot","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05656S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152849,"authors":[{"name":"Kaijen Hsiao","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaijen","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"38252616300"},{"name":"Paul Nangeroni","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Nangeroni","id":"37568945300"},{"name":"Manfred Huber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Huber","id":"37325563900"},{"name":"Ashutosh Saxena","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37573073800"},{"name":"Andrew Y.

Learning is further complicated by the fact that most man-made objects exhibit symmetry, so that there are multiple ldquocorrectrdquo orientations.

Here we present a new sampling strategy for the RRT algorithm, based on an estimated feasibility set, which affords a dramatic improvement in performance in these severely constrained systems. We demonstrate the algorithm with a detailed look at the expansion of an RRT in a swing up task, and on path planning for a nonholonomic car.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","State-space methods","Power system planning","Motion planning","Costs","Space technology","Robotics and automation","Path planning","Robot motion","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator dynamics","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reachability-guided sampling","rapidly-exploring random trees","kinodynamics constraints","feasibility set estimation","path planning","nonholonomic car","manipulators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152874","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152874.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reachability-guided sampling for planning under differential constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reachability-guided sampling for planning under differential constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152874/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152874/","accessionNumber":"10748794","conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reachability-guided sampling for planning under differential constraints","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043769S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5152885,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Haverinen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Haverinen","id":"37330170600"},{"name":"Anssi Kemppainen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Anssi","lastName":"Kemppainen","id":"37579900900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2788-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2789-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"5152885","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic fields","Buildings","Magnetometers","Fluctuations","Steel","Concrete","Industrial electronics","Home appliances","Cement industry","Electronics industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic fields","magnetometers","mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global self-localization technique","local anomalies","ambient magnetic field","magnetic field fluctuations","reinforced concrete structures","electric power systems","electronic appliances","electric appliances","industrial devices","magnetic fingerprint","Monte Carlo localization technique","mobile robot","3-axis magnetometer","wireless wearable magnetometer"]}],"abstract":"Magnetic field fluctuations in modern buildings arise from both natural and man-made sources, such as steel and reinforced concrete structures, electric power systems, electric and electronic appliances, and industrial devices. If the anomalies of the magnetic field inside the building are nearly static and they have sufficient local variability, they provide a unique magnetic fingerprint that can be utilized in global self-localization. In this article, a Monte Carlo localization (MCL) technique based on this hypothesis is proposed. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting a series of global localization experiments conducted in four arbitrarily selected buildings, including a hospital. The experiment setup consists of a mobile robot instrumented with a 3-axis magnetometer and a computer. In addition, successful human self-localization experiments were conducted by using a wireless wearable magnetometer. The reported experiments suggest that the ambient magnetic field may remain sufficiently stable for longer periods of time, giving support for self-localization techniques utilizing the local deviations of the field.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152885","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076472/5152175/05152885.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5152175","startPage":"3142","endPage":"3147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global self-localization technique utilizing local anomalies of the ambient magnetic field","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A global self-localization technique utilizing local anomalies of the ambient magnetic field","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152885/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-17 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10748986","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5152885/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global self-localization technique utilizing local anomalies of the ambient magnetic field","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074359S","chronDate":"12-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076472","isNumber":"5152175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076472","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5152175","articleId":"5152885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5152906,"authors":[{"name":"Christos-S.

Among many techniques, the linear projection is often chosen due to its computational attractiveness and good performance. For applications where real-time performance and flexibility to accommodate new data are required, the linear projection is implemented in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) due to their fine-grain parallelism and reconfigurability properties. Currently, the optimization of such a design is considered as a separate problem from the basis calculation leading to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that couples the calculation of the linear projection basis, the area optimization problem, and the heterogeneity exploration of modern FPGAs. The power of the proposed framework is based on the flexibility to insert information regarding the implementation requirements of the linear basis by assigning a proper prior distribution to the basis matrix. Results from real-life examples on modern FPGA devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where up to 48% reduction in the required area is achieved compared to the current approach, without any loss in the accuracy or throughput of the design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploration of Heterogeneous FPGAs for Mapping Linear Projection Designs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5419135/05152906.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2012510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of Heterogeneous FPGAs for Mapping Linear Projection Designs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5152906/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142352","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of Heterogeneous FPGAs for Mapping Linear Projection Designs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bouganis-2012510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067474S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5419135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5419135","articleId":"5152906","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5152936,"authors":[{"name":"Somsubhra Talapatra","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Somsubhra","lastName":"Talapatra","id":"37541629800"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Jimson Mathew","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Jimson","lastName":"Mathew","id":"37298481800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5152936","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":878},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"Montgomery Algorithm for modular multiplication with a large modulus has been widely used in public key cryptosystems for secured data communication.

The design space for VLSI implementation of Viterbi decoders is huge, involving choices of throughput, latency, area, and power. Even for a fixed set of parameters like constraint length, encoder polynomials and trace-back depth, the task of designing a Viterbi decoder is quite complex and requires significant effort. Sometimes, due to incomplete design space exploration or incorrect analysis, a suboptimal design is chosen. This work analyzes the design complexity by applying most of the known VLSI implementation techniques for hard-decision Viterbi decoding to a different set of code parameters. The conclusions are based on real designs for which actual synthesis and layouts were obtained. In authors' view, due to the depth covered, it is the most comprehensive analysis of the topic published so far.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5152947/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11260231","volume":"18","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design Space Exploration of Hard-Decision Viterbi Decoding: Algorithm and VLSI Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Space Exploration of Hard-Decision Viterbi Decoding: Algorithm and VLSI Implementation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ssawitzki-2017024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092813S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5152947","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5152950,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Cheol Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Ulsan College, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Cheol","lastName":"Cho","id":"37419560200"},{"name":"Jeremy Knowles","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Nevada,\uc2a0Reno, Reno, NV, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Knowles","id":"38559427700"},{"name":"M.

One approach is to create a neural model to emulate normal system behavior and additional models to emulate various fault conditions. The neural models are then placed in parallel with the system to be monitored, and fault detection is achieved by comparing the outputs of the neural models with the real system outputs. Neural network training is achieved using simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Fault classification is based on a simple threshold test of the residuals formed by subtracting each neural model output from the corresponding output of the real system. We present a new approach based on this well known scheme where a Bayesian network is used to evaluate the residuals. The approach is applied to fault detection in a three-phase induction motor.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2020863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5419295/05152950.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2020863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"430","endPage":"437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation of Induction Motors Using Recurrent Neural Networks and Dynamic Bayesian Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Isolation of Induction Motors Using Recurrent Neural Networks and Dynamic Bayesian Modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152950/","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5152950/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142514","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Isolation of Induction Motors Using Recurrent Neural Networks and Dynamic Bayesian Modeling","sourcePdf":"tcst-hcho-2020863.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078938S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5419295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5419295","articleId":"5152950","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5152954,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This result reveals a new interpretation of control signals as a composite of the residual and reference signals. From this viewpoint, different control schemes are studied and useful relationships between the controller structures and embedded residual signals are established. It leads to the development of two kinds of schemes: 1) extracting residual signals from an existing control loop and 2) configuring control loops with an integrated residual access.

It requires insight into the interrelationship among the traffic offered (in terms of the mean offered load M, but also its fluctuation around the mean, i.e., `burstiness'), the envisioned performance level, and the capacity needed. We first derive, for different performance criteria, theoretical dimensioning formulas that estimate the required capacity C as a function of the input traffic and the performance target. For the special case of Gaussian input traffic, these formulas reduce to C=M + alpha V, where alpha directly relates to the performance requirement (as agreed upon in a service level agreement) and V reflects the burstiness (at the timescale of interest). We also observe that Gaussianity applies for virtually all realistic scenarios; notably, already for a relatively low aggregation level, the Gaussianity assumption is justified.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.2009989","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5286817/05152971.pdf","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1644","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.2009989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Dimensioning Through Buffer Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Dimensioning Through Buffer Sampling","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5152971/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918110","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5152971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Dimensioning Through Buffer Sampling","sourcePdf":"tnet-mandjes-2009989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091921S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5286817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5286817","articleId":"5152971","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5152980,"authors":[{"name":"Marieke B.

One of the problems in optical networks is the chromatic dispersion over a standard single mode fiber, which has to be recovered by optical dispersion compensation. Recently, there has been great interest in 100-Gbit/s Ethernet technologies as next generation optical networks in which chromatic dispersion is more severe. Among several types of architectures, digital coherent optical communication system is a promising technology. Correction of the dispersion is performed electrically after digital conversion without any optical compensation, which would ease system construction. Digital storage oscilloscopes with high-speed ADCs are crucial for investigating the architecture and for constructing 100-GbE systems. A flash-type SFQ ADC is attractive for its high-speed sampling clock capability, especially as an instrument for a digital coherent receiver. The maximum operating frequency of the comparator in ADCs was studied by simulation for various critical current densities (J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n). The simulation suggested that using J\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n of 20-40 kA/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n enables the comparator to operate at a clock frequency of more than 100 GHz. An O/E converter, a uni-traveling-carrier photodiode, operable at low-temperature, has been developed and 40-GHz operation was confirmed at 5 K. We have also designed a 1-bit slice of a superconducting quantum interference device-(SQUID) wheel-type ADC and its test circuit including a doubler circuit and two driver types.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5166641/05152998.pdf","startPage":"611","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

developed an advanced process for fabricating a next-generation multi-layer Nb integrated circuit structure incorporating a top active layer. In this structure, the passive-transmission-line (PTL) layer is placed between the top active layer and a DC-bias current layer at the bottom. This structure will make it possible to flexibly design active circuits and PTL wiring, and will also enable active circuits to be effectively shielded from magnetic fields generated by a large DC-bias current. Both the DC-bias current layer and the PTL layer are planarized; however, the top active layer is fabricated without planarization. To fabricate this new structure, it was necessary to achieve a better planarization process for junctions formed over underlying Nb patterns.

In this work, sinuous antennas designed to cover the frequency range of 50 GHz to nearly 900 GHz have been fabricated on semi-insulating silicon substrates. To maintain a self-complementary structure, four antenna arms are used, leading to a frequency-independent input impedance of 74 Omega. Two squares of superconducting niobium HEBs are required at the feed point of the antennas as the sheet resistance of a 10 nm thick niobium thin film is 35 Omega/square. Two sizes of HEBs (120 nm times 240 nm, and 2 mum times 4 mum) have been fabricated using e-beam lithography (EBL), and standard photolithography processes, respectively. A quasi-optical mount with high-resistivity silicon lens has been employed for coupling input power to the sinuous antenna. With a close-cycled cryocooler, the detector performance is studied and evaluated. Detector responsivity at 585 GHz has been presented and compared to waveguide Schottky diode detectors. Noise equivalent power (NEP) measurement is discussed and will be soon performed to the detectors developed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5153031/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10781679","volume":"19","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Development of Integrated Terahertz Broadband Detectors Utilizing Superconducting Hot-Electron Bolometers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Integrated Terahertz Broadband Detectors Utilizing Superconducting Hot-Electron Bolometers","sourcePdf":"tasc-liu-2018268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082179S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5166641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5166641","articleId":"5153031","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5153033,"authors":[{"name":"Amol Inamdar","affiliation":["HYPRES, Inc., Elmsford, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Amol","lastName":"Inamdar","id":"37314425600"},{"name":"Sergey Rylov","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

We have designed several flavors of SQUID based switching amplifiers, each targeted for different power output and speed. One of the amplifiers is a differential amplifier featuring dynamic equalization. To minimize the intersymbol interference, the amplifier employs a pre-emphasis technique, thereby compensating for the bandwidth limitations of the channel. The differential output voltage of this amplifier is 16 mV at low speed (200 Mbps), which rolls off to 2 mV at 16 Gbps data rate, for an \u201c1100\u201d pattern (no consecutive transitions on the input data sequence). For high speed operation of the SQUID amplifiers, simultaneous switching of SQUIDs is desired to reduce the output rise and fall times. Hence, in another amplifier design, called the Differential H-Tree Amplifier, the SQUIDs are arranged in an \u201cH-tree\u201d structure, to equalize the propagation delay of the control signal to each SQUID. The amplifier's differential output voltage is 8 mV at low speed (200 Mbps), and rolls off to 2 mV at 10 Gbps data rate. A third type of amplifier is a differential SFQ-to-DC amplifier; it consists of a pair of synchronously driven SFQ-to-DC converters that produce complementary positive and negative voltage waveforms respectively. The differential output voltage of this amplifier is 0.8 mV, and it can be operated at very high speeds. Moreover, the complexity of this amplifier enables it to be yielded in higher critical current density process. Both, the speed and the output voltage scale as the square root of the process critical current density. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2009.2018413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2018413","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5166641/05153033.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superconducting Switching Amplifiers for High Speed Digital Data Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Superconducting Switching Amplifiers for High Speed Digital Data Links","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10781681","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153033/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superconducting Switching Amplifiers for High Speed Digital Data Links","sourcePdf":"tasc-inamdar-2018413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042907S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"5166641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5153033","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":5153045,"authors":[{"name":"Irina Kataeva","affiliation":["Department of Quantum Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Kataeva","id":"37313373200"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Akaike","affiliation":["Department of Quantum Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Akaike","id":"37313376200"},{"name":"Akira Fujimaki","affiliation":["Department of Quantum Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Fujimaki","id":"37282899900"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Yoshikawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Yoshikawa","id":"37275775800"},{"name":"Naofumi Takagi","affiliation":["Japan Science and Technology Corporation-CREST, Japan","Department of Quantum Engineering, University of Nagoya, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Naofumi","lastName":"Takagi","id":"37281706600"},{"name":"Koji Inoue","affiliation":["Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37293596600"},{"name":"Hiroaki Honda","affiliation":["Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Honda","id":"37396743400"},{"name":"Kazuaki Murakami","affiliation":["Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuaki","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37069140800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"5153045","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Switches","Prototypes","Circuit testing","Quantum computing","CMOS technology","Frequency","Materials science and technology","Numerical simulation","Chemical technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","microprocessor chips","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operand routing network","SFQ reconfigurable data-paths processor","floating-point units","crossbar switches","multicasting function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Operand routing network","reconfigurable data-paths processor","RSFQ"]}],"abstract":"We report the progress in the development of an operand routing network (ORN) for an SFQ reconfigurable data-paths processor (SFQ-RDP).

As the stressing progresses, a dramatic increase in subgap conductance of the junctions, the appearance of subharmonic current steps, and a gradual increase in both the critical and the excess currents as well as a decrease in the normal-state resistance have been observed. A model is proposed wherein a progressively increasing number of defects and associated additional conduction channels (superconducting quantum point contacts (SQPCs)) are induced by the applied electric field in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of the stress effect on the polarity is also investigated and the results are presented. It is found that the magnitude of stress current needed for junction breakdown is unlikely to be supplied during plasma processing and as such, potential differences that can develop during plasma processing appear to be an unlikely cause of fabrication-induced, circuit pattern-dependent variations of Josephson junctions' critical currents in superconductor integrated circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2009.2019022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5166641/05153052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2009.2019022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5166641","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Electrical Stress on Josephson Tunneling Characteristics of - Junctions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Electrical Stress on Josephson Tunneling Characteristics of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\rm Nb/Al/AlO}_{x}/{\\rm Nb}$</tex></formula> Junctions","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10781699","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153052/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Electrical Stress on Josephson Tunneling Characteristics of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\rm Nb/Al/AlO}_{x}/{\\rm Nb}$</tex></formula> Junctions","sourcePdf":"tasc-tolpygo-2019022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062953S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5166641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5166641","articleId":"5153052","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153069,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel A.

First, circuits are mapped into look-up tables (LUTs). Then, LUTs are mapped onto physical resources. The configuration of LUTs is usually determined during the first step and remains unchanged throughout the second. In this paper, we demonstrate that by reconfiguring LUTs during the second step, one can increase the flexibility of FPGA routing resources. This increase in flexibility can then be used to reduce the implementation area of FPGAs. In particular, it is shown that, for a logic cluster with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I</i>\n inputs and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N k</i>\n-input LUTs, a set of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n\u00d7\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I</i>\n+\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n+1):1 multiplexers can be used to connect logic cluster inputs to LUT inputs while maintaining logic equivalency among the logic cluster I/Os.

As a result, the RF circuit performance can be diagnosed and tuned with minimal assistance from external test equipment. Multiple RF performance parameters can be adjusted simultaneously under tuning knob control. The proposed concepts are illustrated for an RF low-noise amplifier (LNA) design and can be applied to other RF circuits as well. A simulation case study and hardware measurements on a fabricated 1.9-GHz LNAs show significant parametric yield enhancement (up to 58%) across the critical RF performance specifications of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2009454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5393244/05153126.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2009454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393244","startPage":"305","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP-Driven Self-Tuning of RF Circuits for Process-Induced Performance Variability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DSP-Driven Self-Tuning of RF Circuits for Process-Induced Performance Variability","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11101770","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5153126/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP-Driven Self-Tuning of RF Circuits for Process-Induced Performance Variability","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-han-2009454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095312S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5393244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5393244","articleId":"5153126","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153127,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/5419295/5153127/5153127-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Wang received the B.A. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical and information engineering from Cambridge University (Magdalene College), Cambridge, U.K., in 2006.

A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2017934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2017934","startPage":"267","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5419295/05153127.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Model Predictive Control Using Online Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast Model Predictive Control Using Online Optimization","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11142499","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5153127/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Model Predictive Control Using Online Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcst-ywang-2017934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102722S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5419295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"756","xplore-issue":"5419295","articleId":"5153127","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5153128,"authors":[{"name":"HongSheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation Engineering, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"HongSheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086104598"},{"name":"Ying Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA","Department of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Luo","id":"37400250700"},{"name":"YangQuan Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"YangQuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5153128","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":284,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2743},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153128","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion control","PD control","Proportional control","Frequency","Design methodology","Tuning","Robustness","Automation","Transfer functions","Control theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system analysis","control system synthesis","motion control","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional order proportional motion controller","fractional order derivative motion controller","design methods","closed loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional calculus","fractional order controller (FOC)","gain variations","iso-damping","$PI^{\\lambda}D^{\\mu}$ controller","second-order plant"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, it is remarkable to see the increasing number of studies related to the theory and application of fractional order controller (FOC), specially \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PI</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00bf</sup>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00bf</sup>\n controller, in many areas of science and engineering.

In this paper, we provide a formal decision software tool to extract the dominant features enabling tool wear prediction. This decision tool is based on a formal mathematical approach that selects dominant features using the singular value decomposition of real-time measurements from the sensors of an industrial cutting tool. Selection of dominant features is important, as retaining only essential features allows reduced signal processing or even reduction in the number of required sensors, which cuts costs. It is shown that the proposed method of dominant feature selection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the least-squares estimation error. The identified dominant features are used with the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to identify parameters in forecasting the time series of cutting tool wear. Experimental results on an industrial high-speed milling machine show the effectiveness in predicting the tool wear using only the dominant features.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Tool Wear Using Dominant Feature Identification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2009.2023318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5289971/05153131.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2009.2023318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5289971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Tool Wear Using Dominant Feature Identification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5153131/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957803","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis of Tool Wear Using Dominant Feature Identification","sourcePdf":"tii-cpang-2023318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100586S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5289971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5289971","articleId":"5153131","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5153183,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Selvamanickam","affiliation":["Strategic Power Systems, Inc., Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Selvamanickam","id":"37313691700"},{"name":"Yimin Chen","affiliation":["Strategic Power Systems, Inc., Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yimin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311246600"},{"name":"Xuming Xiong","affiliation":["Strategic Power Systems, Inc., Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xuming","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37290399100"},{"name":"Yiyuan Y.

Feature vector normalization reduces the acoustic mismatch between training and testing conditions by mapping the feature vectors towards the training space. Model adaptation modifies the parameters of the acoustic models to match the test space. However, since neither is optimal, both approaches use an intermediate space between training and testing spaces to map either the feature vectors or acoustic models. The joint optimization of both approaches provides a common intermediate space with a better match between normalized feature vectors and adapted acoustic models. In this paper, feature vector normalization is based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. A class dependent multi-environment model linear normalization (CD-MEMLIN) based on two classes (silence/speech) with a cross probability model (CD-MEMLIN-CPM) is used. CD-MEMLIN-CPM assumes that each class of clean and noisy spaces can be modeled with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), training a linear transformation for each pair of Gaussians in an unsupervised data-driven training process. This feature vector normalization maps the recognition space feature vector to a normalized space. The acoustic model adaptation maps the training space to the normalized space by defining a set of linear transformations over an expanded HMM-state space, compensating for those degradations that the feature vector normalization is not able to model, like rotations. Experiments have been carried out with the Spanish SpeechDat Car database and Aurora 2 databases using both the standard Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and advanced ETSI front-ends. Consistent improvements were reached for both corpora and front-ends. Using the standard MFCC front-end, a 92.08% average improvement on WER for Spanish SpeechDat Car and a 69.75% average improvement for clean condition evaluation of Aurora 2 was obtained, improving those results reached with ETSI advanced front-end (83.28% and 67.41%, respectively). Using the ETSI advanced front-end with the proposed solution, a 75.47% average improvement was obtained for the clean condition evaluation of Aurora 2 database.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"10984329","htmlLink":"/document/5153277/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Data-Driven Feature Vector Normalization With Acoustic Model Adaptation for Robust Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Data-Driven Feature Vector Normalization With Acoustic Model Adaptation for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"tasl-buera-2026441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126423S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5325825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5325825","articleId":"5153277","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153279,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5153279","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Two-way relaying is a promising scheme to achieve the ubiquitous mobile access to a reliable high data rate service, which is targeted for future mobile communication systems. In this contribution, we investigate two-way relaying with an amplify and forward relay, where the relay as well as the terminals are equipped with multiple antennas. Assuming that the terminals possess channel knowledge, the bidirectional two-way relaying channel is decoupled into two parallel effective single-user MIMO channels by subtracting the self-interference at the terminals. Thereby, any single-user MIMO technique can be applied to transmit the data. We derive an algebraic norm-maximizing (ANOMAX) transmit strategy by finding the relay amplification matrix which maximizes the weighted sum of the Frobenius norms of the effective channels and discuss the implications of this solution on the resulting signal to noise ratios. Finally, we compare ANOMAX to other existing transmission strategies via numerical computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5170191/05153279.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2026453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2026453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Norm-Maximizing (ANOMAX) Transmit Strategy for Two-Way Relaying With MIMO Amplify and Forward Relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mobile communication","Decoding","Digital relays","Filters","Signal to noise ratio","Computer simulation","Quality of service","Costs","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional two-way relaying scheme","amplify-forward relay","multiple antenna","single-user MIMO channel","ANOMAX","algebraic normmaximizing transmit strategy","relay amplification matrix","Frobenius norm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify and forward","MIMO","two-way relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Norm-Maximizing (ANOMAX) Transmit Strategy for Two-Way Relaying With MIMO Amplify and Forward Relays","volume":"16","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5153279/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10826376","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Norm-Maximizing (ANOMAX) Transmit Strategy for Two-Way Relaying With MIMO Amplify and Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"lsp-roemer-2026453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052522S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5170191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5170191","articleId":"5153279","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153283,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Ho Cha","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering and Signal and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5204506/5153283/5153283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byung-Ho Cha (S'06) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in Electronic Engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2004.

We first show that it can be formulated as a multiuser detection problem in a wireless communication system with a time-varying channel response. Being inspired by the multicarrier code-division multiaccess technique, we propose a fingerprinting system that consists of three modules: 1) codeword generation with a multicarrier approach, 2) colluder weight estimation (CWE), and 3) advanced message symbol detection. We construct embedding codes with code spreading followed by multicarrier modulation. For CWE, we show that the weight estimation is analogous to channel response estimation, which can be solved by inserting pilot signals in the embedded fingerprint. As to advanced message symbol detection, we replace the traditional correlation-based detector with the maximal ratio combining detector and the parallel interference cancellation multiuser detector. The superior performance of the proposed fingerprinting system in terms of number of users/identified colluders and the bit-error probability of symbol detection is demonstrated by representative audio and video examples.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2025849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5204506/05153283.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2025849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204506","startPage":"302","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust MC-CDMA-Based Fingerprinting Against Time-Varying Collusion Attacks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust MC-CDMA-Based Fingerprinting Against Time-Varying Collusion Attacks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828736","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153283/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust MC-CDMA-Based Fingerprinting Against Time-Varying Collusion Attacks","sourcePdf":"04tifs03-bcha-2025849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153105S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5204506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5204506","articleId":"5153283","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153294,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyue Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yiyue Wu (S'08) received the B.S. degree in 2006 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and the M.A. degree in 2008 from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, both in electrical engineering.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. student advised by Prof. R.

For example, recent works by Sirianunpiboon and others show that the Silver code and the Golden code can be decoded optimally (or nearly optimally) with quadratic decoding complexity. Fast decodability makes them very attractive in practice. In implementing these decoders, floating-point to fixed-point conversion (FFC) needs to be carefully undertaken to minimize hardware cost while retaining decoding performance. The process of quantization for fixed-point representations is often ignored by research community and lacks investigation, and so FFC is often conducted heuristically based on simulations. This paper studies the effects of quantization to space-time coded systems from an information theoretic perspective. It shows the analytical relationship between quantization error and decoding performance deterioration. This paper also proposes a general finite precision implementation methodology including two FFC criteria for space-time coded systems within an integer optimization framework. As a particular example, this paper examines the finite precision implementation of the quadratic optimal decoding algorithm of the Silver code. However, our methodology and techniques can be applied to general space-time codes.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05153294.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","startPage":"4861","endPage":"4870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Precision Analysis for Space-Time Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite Precision Analysis for Space-Time Decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977223","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153294/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Precision Analysis for Space-Time Decoding","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-2026068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100644S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5153294","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153296,"authors":[{"name":"Rami A.

In the first, limited decision errors are introduced in the add-compare-select units (ACSUs) of a VD to reduce their critical path delays so that they can be operated at lower supply voltages without incurring timing errors. Power savings in this design can reach 58% and 44% with a 0.15 dB coding loss under reduced voltage operation and process variations, respectively, with adaptive supply voltage and adaptive body biasing applied to avoid timing errors. In the other two designs, we permit data-dependent timing errors to occur whenever a critical path in the ACSU is excited. Algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) is then applied to correct for these errors. Power reduction in these schemes is achieved by either overscaling the supply voltage [voltage overscaling (VOS)] or designing at the nominal process corner and supply voltage (average-case design). Two techniques are proposed to develop efficient estimators for error-correction and achieving increased robustness to timing based errors. The first is based on reduced-precision redundancy and the second on state clustering. The first can achieve up to 40% and 25% power savings under VOS and process variations with loss in coding gain of 1.1 and 1.2 dB, respectively, in a 130-nm CMOS process. The second can achieve up to 71% and 62% power savings under VOS and process variations, respectively, at a loss in coding gain of 0.8 and 0.6 dB, respectively. Under process variations, the designs achieve 16-33X improvement in bit error-rate (BER) performance at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Voltage","Timing","Delay","Error correction","Robustness","Redundancy","CMOS process","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","low-power electronics","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-resilient","low-power Viterbi decoder","add-compare-select units","coding loss","algorithmic noise-tolerance","supply voltage","voltage overscaling","bit error-rate","signal-to-noise ratio","loss 0.15 dB","noise figure 2 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithmic noise tolerance","error resiliency","process variations","viterbi decoder (VD)","voltage overscaling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153296","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026078","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05153296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026078","startPage":"4906","endPage":"4917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-Resilient Low-Power Viterbi Decoder Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error-Resilient Low-Power Viterbi Decoder Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153296/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5153296/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977232","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Resilient Low-Power Viterbi Decoder Architectures","sourcePdf":"tsp-abdallah-2026078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089056S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5153296","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5153297,"authors":[{"name":"Jake Gunther","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5153297/5153297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jake Gunther (S'91\u2013M'95) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, UT, in 1994, 1994, and 1998, respectively.","From 1992 to 1994, he was a Research Assistant with the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing Laboratory, BYU.

Like the minimum PE equalizers, the BR algorithms have low computational complexity which is comparable to that of the LMS algorithm. The advantage of the BR criterion is that the loss function can be specified in a manner that accelerates adaptive equalizer convergence relative to the minimum PE adaptive algorithm as illustrated in simulation examples.

While efforts in pitch-based inference methods have led to considerable progress in voiced singing voice separation, little attention has been paid to the incapability of such methods to separate unvoiced singing voice due to its in harmonic structure and weaker energy. In this paper, we proposed a systematic approach to identify and separate the unvoiced singing voice from the music accompaniment. We have also enhanced the performance of separating voiced singing via a spectral subtraction method. The proposed system follows the framework of computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) which consists of the segmentation stage and the grouping stage. In the segmentation stage, the input song signals are decomposed into small sensory elements in different time-frequency resolutions. The unvoiced sensory elements are then identified by Gaussian mixture models. The experimental results demonstrated that the quality of the separated singing voice is improved for both the unvoiced and voiced parts. Moreover, to deal with the problem of lack of a publicly available dataset for singing voice separation, we have constructed a corpus called MIR-1K (multimedia information retrieval lab, 1000 song clips) where all singing voices and music accompaniments were recorded separately. Each song clip comes with human-labeled pitch values, unvoiced sounds and vocal/non-vocal segments, and lyrics, as well as the speech recording of the lyrics.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2026503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5325825/05153305.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2026503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5325825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Improvement of Singing Voice Separation for Monaural Recordings Using the MIR-1K Dataset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Improvement of Singing Voice Separation for Monaural Recordings Using the MIR-1K Dataset","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"10984326","htmlLink":"/document/5153305/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Improvement of Singing Voice Separation for Monaural Recordings Using the MIR-1K Dataset","sourcePdf":"17tasl07-chsu-2026503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169548S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5325825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5325825","articleId":"5153305","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5153309,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Pineda-Sanchez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5153309/5153309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuel Pineda-Sanchez (M'02) was born in Albacete, Spain, in 1962.

The proposed approach is valid for induction machines started at constant frequency and consists of extracting the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the left sideband harmonic (LSH) from the start-up current (LSHst), via the Hilbert transform. It is shown that, in the case of machines with one or several broken bars, the IF of the LSHst exhibits a very characteristic and easy to identify pattern, which is physically justified. This paper also shows that, if the IF of the LSHst is represented against the slip, a universal fault indicator (nondependent neither on the machine characteristics nor on the starting conditions) can be defined. This fault indicator consists of the correlation between the experimental IF of the LSHst and its theoretical evolution. This approach is theoretically introduced and experimentally validated by testing a commercial motor in faulty and healthy conditions, under different operating conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous Frequency of the Left Sideband Harmonic During the Start-Up Transient: A New Method for Diagnosis of Broken Bars","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/05153309.pdf","startPage":"4557","endPage":"4570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Frequency of the Left Sideband Harmonic During the Start-Up Transient: A New Method for Diagnosis of Broken Bars","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5153309/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10916335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Frequency of the Left Sideband Harmonic During the Start-Up Transient: A New Method for Diagnosis of Broken Bars","sourcePdf":"tie-rieraguasp-2026211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146906S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"5153309","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153310,"authors":[{"name":"Leena Vachhani","affiliation":["Design and Manufacturing Kancheepuram, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5291658/5153310/5153310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leena Vachhani (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics from Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg, India, in 1996, the M.Eng. degree in microprocessors from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (MSU), Vadodara, India, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India.","She was a Lecturer with the Department of Electrical Engineering, MSU, for four years.

Consequently, the proposed model can be used to develop new control strategies aimed at avoiding the oxygen-starvation effect and/or minimizing the fuel consumption.

A simplified equivalent transmission line model and numerical full-wave simulations using finite-difference time-domain techniques were used to optimize the sensor design.

Both the transmitter as well as the receiver are assumed to know the channel matrix perfectly. It is well known that, for linear MIMO transceivers, a diagonal transmission (i.e., orthogonalization of the channel matrix) is optimal for some criteria. Surprisingly, it was shown five years ago that for the family of Schur-convex functions an additional rotation of the symbols is necessary. However, if the bit loading is optimized jointly with the linear transceiver, then this rotation is unnecessary. Similarly, for DF MIMO optimized transceivers a rotation of the symbols is sometimes needed. The main result of this paper shows that for a DF MIMO transceiver where the bit loading is jointly optimized with the transceiver filters, the rotation of the symbols becomes unnecessary, and because of this, also the DF part of the receiver is not required. The proof is based on a relaxation of the available bit rates on the individual substreams to the set of positive real numbers. In practice, the signal constellations are discrete and the optimal relaxed bit loading has to be rounded. It is shown that the loss due to rounding is small, and an upper bound on the maximum loss is derived. Numerical results are presented that confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that orthogonal transmission and the truly optimal DF design perform almost equally well.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05153324.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","startPage":"4509","endPage":"4521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Bit Allocation and Precoding for MIMO Systems With Decision Feedback Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Bit Allocation and Precoding for MIMO Systems With Decision Feedback Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918050","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Bit Allocation and Precoding for MIMO Systems With Decision Feedback Detection","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-sbergman-2026522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111765S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5153324","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153325,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, Singapore","School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5286803/5153325/5153325-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feifei Gao (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree from the McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from National University of Singapore in 2007.","He was a Research Fellow at Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore, in 2008.

We propose a two-phase training protocol for the channel estimation, which is compatible with the two-phase data transmission scheme. In the first phase, the two source terminals send their individual training sequences concurrently to the relay, while in the second phase the relay amplifies the received training sequences and broadcasts them to both source terminals. We propose two different types of training methods as well as develop their corresponding channel estimation algorithms at each of the two source terminals. The first type of training is \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">block</i>\n based, for which we first estimate the cascaded source-relay-source channels, and then design algorithms to recover the individual channels between sources and relay. The second type of training is pilot-tone (PT) based, for which we propose to directly estimate the individual channels between sources and relay. Moreover, the identifiability issues on the nonambiguous estimate of the channels in both types of proposed training are carefully addressed. Finally, various numerical examples are presented to corroborate our analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Modulated Two-Way Relay Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026537","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05153325.pdf","startPage":"4443","endPage":"4455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Modulated Two-Way Relay Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5153325/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918078","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation for OFDM Modulated Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-fgao-2026537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191324S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5153325","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153330,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351538700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5153330","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153330","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel architectures","Encoding","Polynomials","Circuits","Hardware","Data communication","Optical feedback","Digital video broadcasting","Optical fiber communication","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error correction codes","logic gates","parallel architectures","shift registers","symbol manipulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CRT-based high-speed parallel architecture","BCH encoding","Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen error-correcting codes","direct linear feedback shifted register-based encoding","XOR gates","J-unfolding method","algebraic manipulation","Chinese remainder theorem-based parallel architecture","fan-out bottleneck"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)","fan-out","linear feedback shifted register (LFSR)","parallel processing","systematic Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghen (BCH) encoding"]}],"abstract":"Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen (BCH) error-correcting codes are now widely used in communication system and digital technology. The direct linear feedback shifted register (LFSR)-based encoding of a long BCH code suffers from the large fan-out effect of some XOR gates. This makes the LFSR-based encoders of long BCH codes not keep up with the data transmission speed in some applications. The technique for eliminating the large fan-out effect by J-unfolding method and some algebraic manipulation has been proposed. In this brief, we present a Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)-based parallel architecture for long BCH encoding. Our novel technique can be used to eliminate the fan-out bottleneck.

It is a particularly popular approach in genomic and proteomic sequence analysis. Numerous mappings of symbolic sequences have been proposed for various applications. It is unclear however whether the processing of symbolic data provides an artifact of the numerical mapping or is an inherent property of the symbolic data. This issue has been long ignored in the engineering and scientific literature. It is possible that many of the results obtained in symbolic signal processing could be a byproduct of the mapping and might not shed any light on the underlying properties embedded in the data. Moreover, in many applications, conflicting conclusions may arise due to the choice of the mapping used for numerical representation of symbolic data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of the equivalence of the mappings used for numerical representation of symbolic data. We present strong and weak equivalence properties and rely on signal correlation to characterize equivalent mappings. We derive theoretical results which establish conditions for consistency among numerical mappings of symbolic data. Furthermore, we introduce an abstract mapping model for symbolic sequences and extend the notion of equivalence to an algebraic framework. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results by application to DNA sequence analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","volume":"57","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10977244","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5153332/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mapping Equivalence for Symbolic Sequences: Theory and Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping Equivalence for Symbolic Sequences: Theory and Applications","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-dschonfeld-2026544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132309S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5153332","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153333,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Garcia-Zubia","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5291658/5153333/5153333-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Javier Garc\u00eda-Zubia (M'08) received the B.S. degree in 1987 and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain, in 1996.","He is with the Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, as an Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Industrial Electronics, Control Engineering, and Computers Architecture.

For this range to be optimally covered, different antenna concepts are considered. At the lowest frequency range, up to a few gigahertz, it is expected that multibeam techniques will be used, increasing the effective field-of-view to a level that allows very efficient detailed and sensitive exploration of the complete sky. Although sparse narrow-band phased arrays are as old as radio astronomy, multioctave sparse and dense arrays now considered for the SKA require new low-noise design, signal processing, and calibration techniques. The successful implementation of these new array techniques has already been introduced for the use of phased array feeds upgrading existing telescopes: enhancing aperture efficiency as well as effective field-of-view. Especially the development of low-cost array antenna design will allow a cost-effective large-scale implementation for the SKA. This paper addresses these new capabilities, emphasizing the R&D work done in Europe and aims to provide insight into the status of enabling technologies and technical research on polarization, calibration, and side-lobe control that will unleash the potential of phased arrays for future growth of radio astronomy synthesis arrays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153341/","volume":"97","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5153341/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10763854","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extending the Field of View With Phased Array Techniques: Results of European SKA Research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the Field of View With Phased Array Techniques: Results of European SKA Research","sourcePdf":"jproc-bijdevaate-2021594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092489S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5165124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5165124","articleId":"5153341","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5153347,"authors":[{"name":"Tejprakash Pochiraju","affiliation":["High Frequency Engineering Group, Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5338646/5153347/5153347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tejprakash Pochiraju (S'08) received the Bachelors degree in electronics engineering (First Class honors) from Mumbai University, India, and the Masters degree in RF and microwave engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

The robustness of the algorithm to a number of common practical implementation issues (group delay, DC offset, propagation delay) are also discussed and demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Radio transmitters","Propagation delay","Robustness","Radio frequency","Degradation","Signal processing algorithms","Topology","Temperature dependence","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-wise I/Q imbalance estimation","block-wise I/Q imbalance compensation","direct-conversion radio transmitter","modulator complex gain imbalance","demodulator complex gain imbalance","actual in-phase component","quadrature component","transmitter-under-test","DC offset","propagation delay","phase imbalance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC offset","direct-conversion","gain imbalance","I/Q imbalance","phase imbalance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05153348.pdf","startPage":"4970","endPage":"4973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Wise Estimation of and Compensation for I/Q Imbalance in Direct-Conversion Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block-Wise Estimation of and Compensation for I/Q Imbalance in Direct-Conversion Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153348/","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5153348/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10977254","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Wise Estimation of and Compensation for I/Q Imbalance in Direct-Conversion Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tsp-bassam-2026598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041893S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5153348","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5153350,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Yaghoobi","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communication, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5153350/5153350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehrdad Yaghoobi (S'98\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 1999 and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2002.

It has been shown that one can sparsely approximate some natural signals using an overcomplete set of parametric functions. A problem in using these parametric dictionaries is how to choose the parameters. In practice, these parameters have been chosen by an expert or through a set of experiments. In the sparse approximation context, it has been shown that an incoherent dictionary is appropriate for the sparse approximation methods. In this paper, we first characterize the dictionary design problem, subject to a constraint on the dictionary. Then we briefly explain that equiangular tight frames have minimum coherence. The complexity of the problem does not allow it to be solved exactly. We introduce a practical method to approximately solve it. Some experiments show the advantages one gets by using these dictionaries.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05153350.pdf","startPage":"4800","endPage":"4810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2026610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2026610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Dictionary Design for Sparse Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Matching pursuit algorithms","Design methodology","Image coding","Signal generators","Pursuit algorithms","Signal design","Humans","Approximation methods","Filter bank"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric dictionary design","sparse coding","sparse approximation context","minimum coherence","equiangular tight frames"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dictionary design","exact sparse recovery","Gammatone filter banks","incoherent dictionary","parametric dictionary","sparse approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Dictionary Design for Sparse Coding","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5153350/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977229","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Dictionary Design for Sparse Coding","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-myaghoobi-2026610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090515S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5153350","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153353,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5379144/5153353/5153353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoon Kim (S\u201907) was born in JinJu, Korea, in 1982.

Therefore, we can avoid the problems such as redistribution of injected charges, second-bit effect, and short-channel effect.

It is properly implemented to operate in stand-alone mode, and it is interfaced with hardware modules to exchange information and data, locally, with RS-232 connection or, remotely, with Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol communication. The design includes enhancing of transducer performances through the correction of systematic errors with digital filters implemented by a field-programmable gate array module. This instance allows better performance without increasing cost. Finally, the whole accuracy of the proposed measurement system is evaluated by experimental tests that were performed in agreement with the specification of a class-A instrument for some of the main PQ indexes. The tests are performed, including the transducers, although that component is not required by the standard, to evaluate the behavior of compensated transducers. The test results are compared with those obtained by a commercial PQ instrument and show a good agreement.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2016890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5200743/05153356.pdf","startPage":"3149","endPage":"3158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2016890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Quality Monitoring Instrument With FPGA Transducer Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153356/","displayDocTitle":"Power-Quality Monitoring Instrument With FPGA Transducer Compensation","volume":"58","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5153356/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10816368","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Quality Monitoring Instrument With FPGA Transducer Compensation","sourcePdf":"tim-femine-2016890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069358S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5200743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5200743","articleId":"5153356","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153361,"authors":[{"name":"Evaggelia Matskani","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5153361/5153361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Evaggelia Matskani received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Greece, in 2007, where she is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests are in signal processing for communications, with emphasis on convex optimization and cross-layer design of wireless networks."]},"firstName":"Evaggelia","lastName":"Matskani","id":"37573102300"},{"name":"Nicholas D.

Multicast beamforming was recently proposed as a means of exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to boost spectral efficiency and meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Infeasibility is a key issue in this context, due to power or mutual interference limitations. We therefore consider the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem for one or more co-channel multicast groups, with the objective of maximizing the number of subscribers served and minimizing the power required to serve them. The problem is NP-hard even for an isolated multicast group and no admission control; but drawing upon our earlier work for the multiuser SDMA downlink, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that yields good solutions at affordable worst-case complexity. For the special case of an isolated multicast, Lozano proposed a particularly simple adaptive algorithm for implementation in UMTS-LTE. We identify strengths and drawbacks of Lozano's algorithm, and propose two simple but worthwhile improvements. All algorithms are carefully tested on publicly available indoor/outdoor measured channel data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

a promising scheme for multicarrier (MC) transmission. The combination of OFDM and code-division multiple access (CDMA) which is referred to as OFDM-CDMA, has recently attracted much research interest in wireless communications. In this paper, we evaluate the downlink performance for two forms of adaptive OFDM-CDMA receivers in multipath fading channels: 1) MC-CDMA and 2) MC-direct sequence (DS)-CDMA. We propose theoretical minimum mean square errors (MMSEs) for MC-CDMA and MC-DS-CDMA to compare the performances in different situations. Moreover, one drawback of OFDM schemes is the rate reduction due to the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead, which significantly affects the channel utilization in MC-DS-CDMA systems. We propose adaptive receiver structures with both subcarrier- and code-interval equalizations to improve the performance of MC-DS-CDMA systems with shorter or no CP. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receivers and the correctness of the theoretical derivations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2026479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05153365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2026479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","startPage":"4805","endPage":"4818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analyses of OFDM\u2013CDMA Receivers in Multipath Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analyses of OFDM\u2013CDMA Receivers in Multipath Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966617","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analyses of OFDM\u2013CDMA Receivers in Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-ueng-2026479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049561S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5153365","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153366,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyuan Ta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Sydney Research Laboratory, NICTA, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5153366/5153366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyuan Ta (S'09) received the B.Sc. degree in physics in 2003 from Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications in 2005 from the University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications.","He is also with the Sydney Research Laboratory, National ICT Australia.

Instead of requiring all nodes to be connected, we require that only a large fraction (e.g., 95%) be connected, which is called the giant component. We show that, with this slightly relaxed requirement on connectivity, significant energy savings can be achieved for a large-scale network. In particular, we assume that a total of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n nodes are randomly independently uniformly distributed in a unit square in Rfr\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, that each node has uniform transmission power, and that any two nodes are directly connected if and only if the power that was received by one node from the other node, as determined by the log-normal shadowing model, is larger than or equal to a given threshold. First, we derive an upper bound on the minimum transmission power at which the probability of having a giant component of order above \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">qn</i>\n for any fixed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n isin (0, 1) tends to one as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n rarr infin .

We then show that the ratio of the aforementioned transmission power that was required for a giant component to the transmission power that was required for a connected network tends to zero as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n rarr infin. This result implies significant energy savings if we require that only most nodes (e.g., 95%) be connected rather than requiring all nodes to be connected. This result is also applicable for any other arbitrary channel model that satisfies certain intuitively reasonable conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2026480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05153366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2026480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","startPage":"5152","endPage":"5163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Giant Component of Wireless Multihop Networks in the Presence of Shadowing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Giant Component of Wireless Multihop Networks in the Presence of Shadowing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966654","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153366/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Giant Component of Wireless Multihop Networks in the Presence of Shadowing","sourcePdf":"tvt-ta-2026480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177254S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5153366","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153371,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The delay loop effects can be mitigated by an SC-OPLL integrated realization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20-Gb/s Quadrature Phase-Shift-Keying Real-Time Coherent System Based on a Subcarrier Optical Phase-Locked Loop","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2009.2025388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/5230334/05153377.pdf","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2009.2025388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5153377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"A 20-Gb/s Quadrature Phase-Shift-Keying Real-Time Coherent System Based on a Subcarrier Optical Phase-Locked Loop","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/5153377/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10847509","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20-Gb/s Quadrature Phase-Shift-Keying Real-Time Coherent System Based on a Subcarrier Optical Phase-Locked Loop","sourcePdf":"lpt-torrengo-2025388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042381S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5230334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5230334","articleId":"5153377","onlineDate":"30 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5153381,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Yu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278392400"},{"name":"Xiang Zhou","affiliation":["Laboratories-Research, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Inc., Middletown, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37280487800"},{"name":"Ming-Fang Huang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Fang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37306839000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5153381","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fiber polarization","High speed optical techniques","Optical filters","Optical modulation","Stimulated emission","Transmission lines","Channel spacing","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Optical fiber filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed optical techniques","optical fibre communication","optical fibre polarisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed PDM-RZ-8QAM DWDM transmission","standard single-mode fiber","high-speed optical transmission","dense wavelength-division-multiplexing","polarization-division-multiplexing return-to-zero","digital coherent detection","filtering effects","nonreturn-to-zero format","quadrature amplitude modulation","distance 640 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent detection","multilevel modulation","signal transmission"]}],"abstract":"Based on the practicability issue, using the standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) in the transmission line is important for high-speed optical transmission.

Subjective evaluation results show that the new system generates significantly better quality synthetic speech than speaker-dependent approaches with realistic amounts of speech data, and that it bears comparison with speaker-dependent approaches even when large amounts of speech data are available.

In this paper, we describe the design, fabrication, and testing of a rapid and inexpensive sensor, involving the use of microelectrodes in a microchannel, which can be used for real-time electrical detection of specific interactions between proteins. We have successfully demonstrated detection of target glycoprotein-glycoprotein interactions, antigen-antibody interactions, and glycoprotein-antigen interactions. We have also demonstrated the ability of this technique to distinguish between strong and weak interactions. Using this approach, it may be possible to multiplex an array of these sensors onto a chip and probe a complex mixture for various types of interactions involving protein molecules.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5153561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5153561/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10736178","pubMedId":"20467571","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Microfluidic Platform for Characterization of Protein\u2013Protein Interactions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Microfluidic Platform for Characterization of Protein\u2013Protein Interactions","sourcePdf":"jsen-mjavanmard-2022558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066922S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5153558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5153558","articleId":"5153561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5153565,"authors":[{"name":"Jimin Cheon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5153558/5153565/5153565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jimin Cheon (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

In this paper, MRTD scheme is applied for the analysis of field distribution of two-dimensional (2-D) targets in a planar transmission line interconnect shielded using PEC boundary conditions for Transverse Magnetic(TM) and Transverse Electric (TE) waves. Analysis of the planar transmission line interconnect structure is done using MATLAB 7.2. Commonly used scaling and wavelet orthogonal functions are introduced for the electromagnetic problem. Field distributions within the structure are computed for Signal Integrity Analysis by conventional FDTD and MRTD and they are compared. The superiority of MRTD scheme over conventional FDTD is presented.","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Electromagnetic Interference & Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Electromagnetic Interference & Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075459/5154173/05154219.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of MRTD and FDTD schemes for Signal Integrity in interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5154219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5154219/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of MRTD and FDTD schemes for Signal Integrity in interconnects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10748588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5154219/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of MRTD and FDTD schemes for Signal Integrity in interconnects","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"M04c1_-_orig-research_-_007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.164203S","chronDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5075459","isNumber":"5154173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075459","xplore-issue":"5154173","articleId":"5154219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society of EMC Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5154314,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Progress in computer technology enables us to use FDTD method to numerically calculate the interactions of human head and mobile. The biological effects of Radio Frequency (RF) energy are proportional to the rate of energy absorption. A novel method for the modeling of human head is carried out using the MATLAB 7.2 Software, which employs FDTD method for the SAR calculations. A three dimensional FDTD algorithm is built in Cartesian coordinates. Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) which is one of the most flexible and efficient ABCs is implemented to avoid reflections. It is a popular method for mesh termination at a radiation boundary using FDTD. A discrete human head model is located within FDTD volume together with a discrete hand-held receiver model. FDTD simulations are carried out for Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT) operating at 1.8 GHz system. SAR distributions over the human head are calculated and are shown to agree with results available in literature. Particular attention has been given for accurate power calculations. The computational results are interpreted in terms of international safety guidelines for human health. This paves the way to model cell phones with appropriate SAR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD based evaluation of Specific Absorption Rate distribution in human head due to mobile phones","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Electromagnetic Interference & Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Electromagnetic Interference & Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/5075459/5154173/05154314.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5154314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5154314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FDTD based evaluation of Specific Absorption Rate distribution in human head due to mobile phones","conferenceDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5154314/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10748638","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD based evaluation of Specific Absorption Rate distribution in human head due to mobile phones","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"M10c1_-_orig-research_-_008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062078S","chronDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5075459","isNumber":"5154173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075459","xplore-issue":"5154173","articleId":"5154314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society of EMC Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5154325,"authors":[{"name":"Dhiraj K.

Hence, knowledge of the input to the antenna and its response to the same; along with a technique to relate them with the impulse response needs to be devised. Deconvolving the input and the output signals give the impulse response of the system. A solution to the deconvolution problem is presented using an iterative method; wherein, the iteration is applied over discrete data in time domain. Given the input and the measured output from an asymptotic conical monopole, which is an ultra wide band system, a method is shown to determine the impulse response of the monopole. The uniqueness of the estimate of the impulse response is sensitive to the nature of the errors in input and output data acquired. Here, conjugate gradient method is employed to estimate the impulse response of the monopole antenna.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5154325/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5154325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10748643","conferenceDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impulse response determination of asymptotic conical monopole using conjugate gradient method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulse response determination of asymptotic conical monopole using conjugate gradient method","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"M10n7_-_orig-research_-_134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040184S","chronDate":"26-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5075459","isNumber":"5154173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5075459","xplore-issue":"5154173","articleId":"5154325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society of EMC Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5155916,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Kwan Tam","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, South-East University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5153558/5155916/5155916-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Kwan Tam received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, in 1964, the B.Sc.

Experimental results for the TSI are in agreement with theoretical and simulated prediction.","doi":"10.1109/CPE.2009.5156034","publicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109124/5155997/05156034.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2009.5156034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5155997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New type T-Source inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156034/","displayDocTitle":"New type T-Source inverter","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156034/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749232","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New type T-Source inverter","confLoc":"Badajoz, Spain","sourcePdf":"01_002283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036354S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109124","isNumber":"5155997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109124","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"5155997","articleId":"5156034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156035,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Ali Mohammadpour","affiliation":["Power Electronic Research Lab (PERL), Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein Ali","lastName":"Mohammadpour","id":"37399204200"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Alizadeh Pahlavani","affiliation":["Power Electronic Research Lab (PERL), Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza Alizadeh","lastName":"Pahlavani","id":"37568857800"},{"name":"Abbas Shoulaie","affiliation":["Power Electronic Research Lab (PERL), Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Shoulaie","id":"37369878100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2855-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2856-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9538"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9546"}],"articleNumber":"5156035","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Damping","Open loop systems","Resonance","Power transmission lines","Frequency","Takagi-Sugeno model","Fuzzy logic","Mathematical model","Computer languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","fuzzy control","open loop systems","oscillations","power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate controlled series capacitor","power oscillation damping","subsynchronous resonance","steam turbine-generator","transmission line","series compensation","turn-off angle control","open-loop control","line current frequency oscillation","closed loop control","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic controller","IEEE first benchmark model","electromechanical power oscillation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156035","doi":"10.1109/CPE.2009.5156035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2009.5156035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5155997","publicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109124/5155997/05156035.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On control of gate controlled series capacitor for SSR and power oscillation damping","abstract":"The subsynchronous resonance (SSR) phenomenon may occur when a steam turbine-generator is connected to a long transmission line with series compensation. In this paper, to mitigate SSR, two control methodologies for turn-off angle control of the gate-controlled series capacitor (GCSC) are presented. The first methodology is an open-loop control that uses the line current frequency oscillations to generate proper turn-ff angle for the GCSC. The second one is a closed loop control that is based on the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy logic controller. The study system was modified from the IEEE first benchmark model by changing a part of the fixed series capacitor to the GCSC. The MATLABreg program was used to verify the effectiveness of each control methodology. Three different GCSC ratings were analyzed. It is shown that using an open-loop control methodology, in some GCSC ratings, the SSR can be properly damped. It is also shown that using TS fuzzy control methodology, not only SSR but also electromechanical power oscillation can be effectively damped.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156035/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749233","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On control of gate controlled series capacitor for SSR and power oscillation damping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On control of gate controlled series capacitor for SSR and power oscillation damping","confLoc":"Badajoz, Spain","sourcePdf":"02_000159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04517S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109124","isNumber":"5155997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109124","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5155997","articleId":"5156035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5156045,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This higher electrical power demand has resulted in the increase of DC voltage levels in order to reduce the power losses and the wiring size by decreasing the current levels. Traditional protections, like electromagnetic circuit breakers, are not suitable for protection of high voltage DC systems. As a consequence new technologies like Solid State Power Controllers (SSPC) have been introduced. SSPC combine the functions of connecting loads to the main electrical bus and protecting the electrical installations from overloads and short-circuits. In order to analyse these new protection devices in the onboard Power Distribution System (PDS), models of SSPC have to be developed. This paper presents and analyses two different SSPC models. The first model is based on SSPC internal structure and the second model is based on the SSPC behaviour. Finally, the SSPC behavioural model has been validated within an experimental test bench using commercial SSPC.","doi":"10.1109/CPE.2009.5156045","publicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Compatibility and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109124/5155997/05156045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2009.5156045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5155997","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling methods for Solid State Power Controllers (SSPC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling methods for Solid State Power Controllers (SSPC)","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156045/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749243","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling methods for Solid State Power Controllers (SSPC)","confLoc":"Badajoz, Spain","sourcePdf":"02_001155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043925S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109124","isNumber":"5155997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109124","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5155997","articleId":"5156045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156048,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This correspondence explores solutions to a new issue that image retrieval using unclean positive examples. In the proposed scheme, multiple feature distances are combined to obtain image similarity using classification technology. To handle the noisy positive examples, a new two-step strategy is proposed by incorporating the methods of data cleaning and noise tolerant classifier.

The use of diversity is particularly important for multimedia communications over fading channels. In this work, we study the transmission of progressive image bitstreams using channel coding in a 2D time-frequency resource block in an OFDM network, employing time and frequency diversities simultaneously. In particular, in the frequency domain, based on the order of diversity and the correlation of individual subcarriers, we construct symmetric \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-channel FEC-based multiple descriptions using channel erasure codes combined with embedded image coding. In the time domain, a concatenation of RCPC codes and CRC codes is employed to protect individual descriptions. We consider the physical channel conditions arising from various coherence bandwidths and coherence times, leading to a range of orders of diversities available in the time and frequency domains. We investigate the effects of different error patterns on the delivered image quality due to various fade rates. We also study the tradeoffs and compare the relative effectiveness associated with the use of erasure codes in the frequency domain and convolutional codes in the time domain under different physical environments. Both the effects of intercarrier interference and channel estimation errors are included in our study. Specifically, the effects of channel estimation errors, frequency selectivity and the rate of the channel variations are taken into consideration for the construction of the 2D time-frequency block. We provide results showing the gain that the proposed model achieves compared to a system without temporal coding. In one example, for a system experiencing flat fading, low Doppler, and imperfect CSI, we find that the increase in PSNR compared to a system without time diversity is as much as 9.4 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2026676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05156263.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2026676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","startPage":"2476","endPage":"2490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Coding for Progressive Images in a 2-D Time-Frequency OFDM Block With Channel Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Coding for Progressive Images in a 2-D Time-Frequency OFDM Block With Channel Estimation Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918087","pubMedId":"19586820","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156263/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Coding for Progressive Images in a 2-D Time-Frequency OFDM Block With Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"tip-toni-2026676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097376S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5156263","onlineDate":"06 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5156266,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Liang Su","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5170200/5156266/5156266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chua-Liang Su (M'03) received the electrical and electronic engineer's degree from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), Manchester, U.K., in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Manchester in 2007.","He is currently a Research Associate at the University of Manchester."]},"firstName":"Chua-Liang","lastName":"Su","id":"37579283700"},{"name":"Daniel Kirschen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5170200/5156266/5156266-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel S.

ELs are a family of power converters which are used as variable impedance loads in several applications. Such applications include testing of photovoltaic (PV) cells, power converters, and power supplies or frequency control of stand-alone microgeneration. In PV-cell performance tests, the zero-voltage operation, near the short-circuit point of the PV cell's I- V curve, creates a challenge for EL design. The converter that is suitable for this application must have the ideal current source behavior because the challenge is to draw a specific constant current from the source under test even during the zero-voltage condition. The energy recycling principle increases the efficiency and allows the construction of high-power ELs. The proposed topologies are based on the Z-source converter and achieve the ideal current source behavior of draining an adjustable current even when the source voltage is zero. These topologies also provide power recycling for energy saving and for developing high-power ELs. The first configuration is based on the traditional Z-source converter, and the second one is based on the recently proposed quasi Z-source converter. Two prototypes were analyzed and built. Experimental results are provided to verify the principle of operation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5291658/05156277.pdf","startPage":"4894","endPage":"4902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Z-Source-Converter-Based Energy-Recycling Zero-Voltage Electronic Loads","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5291658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Z-Source-Converter-Based Energy-Recycling Zero-Voltage Electronic Loads","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964694","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5156277/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Z-Source-Converter-Based Energy-Recycling Zero-Voltage Electronic Loads","sourcePdf":"tie-rosascaro-2026374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120277S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5291658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5291658","articleId":"5156277","onlineDate":"06 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5156278,"authors":[{"name":"Lixian Zhang","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/5156278/5156278-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lixian Zhang was born in Jilin Province, China, in 1978.

However, the control process may become unstable for large gains due to the digital and delay effects. In this paper, the act-and-wait control concept is compared with the traditional, continuous control concept for a digital force control model with proportional feedback subject to a short, one sample unit feedback delay. Both concepts are implemented in an experimental setup. It is shown that the proportional gain can be increased significantly without losing stability when the act-and-wait controller is used; thus, the force error can effectively be decreased this way. The results are confirmed by experiments. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Delay effects","Control systems","Proportional control","Robots","Force feedback","Stability","Environmental economics","Communication system control","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","feedback","force control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital force control process","act-and-wait control concept","proportional feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-time systems","feedback systems","force control","stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2024683","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5439994/05156285.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5439994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2024683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the Accuracy of Digital Force Control Process Using the Act-and-Wait Concept","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the Accuracy of Digital Force Control Process Using the Act-and-Wait Concept","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156285/","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156285/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11206108","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the Accuracy of Digital Force Control Process Using the Act-and-Wait Concept","sourcePdf":"tmech-insperger-2024683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056992S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5439994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5439994","articleId":"5156285","onlineDate":"06 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5156286,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Tokuda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5259693/5156286/5156286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takashi Tokuda (M'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronic engineering in 1993 and 1995, respectively, and the Dr. Eng. degree in materials engineering in 1998, all from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.","He joined the Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan, in 1999, where he was an Assistant Professor and currently an Associate Professor (since 2008), working on photonic materials science and photonic device engineering.

By cascading these two stages, e.g., on the basis of a cascode, and optimizing added feedback elements, it is possible to compensate these phase variations. A universal analysis based on bipolar transistors is derived. However, the insights can be mapped to other transistors such as field-effect transistors. The analysis is verified by implementation of a low-noise cascode amplifier in 0.25-mum silicon germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors. At 50-Omega terminations, 1.6-V supply voltage, 1-mA current consumption, and a gain of 7 dB plusmn 0.25 dB, a noise figure of less than 3.2 dB, and a third-order output intercept point of -3 dBm are measured within a frequency range from 5.2 to 5.9 GHz. For a gain control range of 12 and 20 dB, the transmission phase variations are reduced to 3deg and 6deg, respectively, which is around a factor of 7 better than for a conventional noncompensated cascode topology.

The clustering methodology addresses two critical issues in unsupervised data clustering - the ability to produce meaningful classification in noisy data, and the requirement that the number of clusters be known a priori. The GA-driven clustering routine optimizes number of clusters as well as cluster assignment, and cluster prototypes. A two-parameter, mapped, fixed point coding scheme is used to represent assignment of data into either the true retained set and the noisy trimmed set, and the optimal number of clusters in the retained set. A three-objective criterion is used as the minimization functional for the GA.

The advantage of using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is the ease with which controllers can be re-designed based on requirements without incurring major non recurring engineering (NRE) costs. In this paper, the implementation of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system has been demonstrated with the application of a home water sprinkler system. The design of the home water sprinkler system uses two inputs, temperature and soil humidity, to give a single output, watering duration. VHDL programming language is used for creating the design in which simulations are carried out to check the functional verification of individual blocks. The design created on VHDL platform was synthesized, verified and implemented using Xilinx integrated software environment (ISE) Version 6.1. The bit stream created is downloaded onto the Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA which is mounted on a V2MB1000 board. For the verification of FIS, DIP switches and push buttons were used to simulate inputs. The outputs and inputs were displayed on the two seven segment LED displays. The accuracy of the model on FPGA was compared with simulation results obtained using MATLAB & fuzzy logic tool box. The results obtained from the two models differed with a root mean square (R.M.S.) error of 0.8%.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.2009.5156408","publicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2009 - 2009 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","displayPublicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2009 - 2009 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109425/5156374/05156408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.2009.5156408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156374","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system on an FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system on an FPGA","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156408/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10749362","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system on an FPGA","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"028_nafips2009_submission_12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040974S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109425","isNumber":"5156374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109425","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5156374","articleId":"5156408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156424,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Hell","affiliation":["DCA-FEEC-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Hell","id":"37299206300"},{"name":"Fernando Gomide","affiliation":["DCA-FEEC-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Gomide","id":"37271287000"},{"name":"Rosangela Ballini","affiliation":["IE-DTE-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rosangela","lastName":"Ballini","id":"37271286100"},{"name":"Pyramo Costa","affiliation":["PPGEE-PUC-MG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"],"firstName":"Pyramo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37289245500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4575-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5156424","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156424","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Biological information theory","Biological system modeling","Data mining","Computational efficiency","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy sets","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","mathematics computing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series forecasting","fuzzy neural network","uninetwork","logic neuron","nonlinear processing","internal parameter","knowledge extraction","if-then rule","linguistic model","fuzzy inference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.2009.5156424","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109425/5156374/05156424.pdf","publicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2009 - 2009 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","displayPublicationTitle":"NAFIPS 2009 - 2009 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.2009.5156424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uninetworks in time series forecasting","abstract":"This paper presents an approach for time series forecasting using a new class of fuzzy neural networks called uninetworks. Uninetworks are constructed using a recent generalization of the classic and and or logic neurons. These generalized logic neurons, called unineurons, provide a mechanism to implement general nonlinear processing and introduce important characteristics of biological neurons such as neuronal AND synaptic plasticity. Unineurons achieve synaptic and neuronal plasticity modifying their internal parameters in response to external changes. Thus, unineurons may individually vary from an and neuron to an or neuron (and vice-versa), depending upon the necessity of the modeling task. Besides, the proposed neural fuzzy networks are able to extract knowledge from input/output data and to encode it explicitly in the form of if-then rules. Therefore, linguistic models are obtained in a form suitable for human understanding. Experimental results show that the models proposed here are more general and perform best in terms of accuracy and computational costs when compared against alternative approaches suggested in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156424/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10749378","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156424/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uninetworks in time series forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uninetworks in time series forecasting","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"044_nafips2009_submission_46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064203S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109425","isNumber":"5156374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109425","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5156374","articleId":"5156424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5156487,"authors":[{"name":"Meysam Alizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Meysam","lastName":"Alizadeh","id":"37570934800"},{"name":"Elnaz Fotoohi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Elnaz","lastName":"Fotoohi","id":"37568212600"},{"name":"Vahid Roshanaei","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Roshanaei","id":"37568213000"},{"name":"Ehsan Safavieh","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics & Computer Science, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Safavieh","id":"37568214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4575-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4577-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5156487","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Testing","Topology","Evolutionary computation","Information processing","Industrial engineering","Mathematics","Computer science","Robustness","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustering based fuzzy particle swarm optimization","topologically nearest particles","neighborhood size","CFPSO model","gbest","lbest"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Fuzzy Clustering","Neighborhood"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156487","abstract":"In local version (lbest) of particle swarm optimization (PSO), each particle has only the information of its own and its neighbors' best, rather than all the population.

This paper presents a new categorization for concept drift, separating drifts according to different criteria into mutually exclusive and nonheterogeneous categories. Moreover, although ensembles of learning machines have been used to learn in the presence of concept drift, there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for that and which of their features can contribute or not for that. As diversity is one of these features, we present a diversity analysis in the presence of different types of drifts. We show that, before the drift, ensembles with less diversity obtain lower test errors. On the other hand, it is a good strategy to maintain highly diverse ensembles to obtain lower test errors shortly after the drift independent on the type of drift, even though high diversity is more important for more severe drifts. Longer after the drift, high diversity becomes less important. Diversity by itself can help to reduce the initial increase in error caused by a drift, but does not provide the faster recovery from drifts in long-term.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5434317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5434317/05156502.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2009.156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2009.156","startPage":"730","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Diversity on Online Ensemble Learning in the Presence of Concept Drift","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156502/","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Diversity on Online Ensemble Learning in the Presence of Concept Drift","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156502/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"11180159","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Diversity on Online Ensemble Learning in the Presence of Concept Drift","sourcePdf":"ttk2010050730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048698S","chronDate":"May  2010","isNumber":"5434317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"266","articleId":"5156502","onlineDate":"06 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5156505,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Proen\u00e7a","affiliation":["Departmento de Inform\u00e9tica, Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilhaa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5487331/5156505/5156505-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hugo Proen\u00e7a received the BSc degree in mathematics/informatics from the University of Beira Interior (Portugal) in 2001.

The WSTM problem is a trade-off between maximizing the sum data rate, and balancing the users' queue lengths. It may therefore be seen as a cross-layer resource allocation objective suited for Best Effort users. A graph-based subcarrier allocation for WSTM, deduced from the pairwise capacity region, is determined. Joint transmission of two interfering links is allowed depending on the convexity of the capacity region, and on the relative links' weights. Subcarrier allocation may be followed by an iterative power control process. Numerical results show that graph-based subcarrier allocation is necessary to avoid interference-limited situations at medium to high load, and that this method followed by power control is more effective than binary allocation to maximize the weighted sum data rate and balance the queue lengths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-based weighted sum throughput maximization in OFDMA cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","doi":"10.1109/IWCLD.2009.5156509","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153335/5156507/05156509.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCLD.2009.5156509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156507","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based weighted sum throughput maximization in OFDMA cellular networks","conferenceDate":"11-12 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156509/","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10749988","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based weighted sum throughput maximization in OFDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06543S","chronDate":"11-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153335","isNumber":"5156507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5156507","articleId":"5156509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156522,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Casari","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Casari","id":"37296365200"},{"name":"Davide Chiarotto","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Chiarotto","id":"37395763900"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","affiliation":["California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi","id":"37278668800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3301-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3302-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5156522","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","MIMO","Ad hoc networks","Channel estimation","Physical layer","Complex networks","Channel state information","Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","channel estimation","MIMO communication","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC-level performance metrics","MIMO ad hoc networks","channel estimation","point-to-point links","multiuser transmissions","cross-layer MAC","PHY parameters","MAC protocols"]}],"abstract":"Classic approaches to channel estimation in MIMO ad hoc networks focus on the accuracy of the estimation techniques as applied to point-to-point links. However, when considering more complex networks, a number of further issues arise that have a significant impact on the performance of channel estimation. More specifically, ad hoc networks usually feature many simultaneous non-orthogonal communications whose impact on channel estimation as well as on higher layers of the protocol stack has not yet been thoroughly studied. In this paper we present some results on the effects of multiuser transmissions on channel state information accuracy in MIMO ad hoc networks, and evaluate the impact of imperfect channel estimation on the performance of MAC protocols. In particular, we consider a cross-layer MAC which accounts for the structure and behavior of the underlying PHY to make decisions on channel access; we then show the interplay between PHY parameters (such as the length of the training sequences used for channel estimation or the number of antennas) and MAC-level performance metrics such as throughput, efficiency, and success ratio. Our results show that relevant tradeoffs arise in this context and allow, e.g., to tune the MAC layer behavior by controlling the channel estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IWCLD.2009.5156522","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153335/5156507/05156522.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCLD.2009.5156522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the tradeoff between MAC-level performance metrics in MIMO ad hoc networks with imperfect channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156522/","displayDocTitle":"On the tradeoff between MAC-level performance metrics in MIMO ad hoc networks with imperfect channel estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750001","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156522/","conferenceDate":"11-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the tradeoff between MAC-level performance metrics in MIMO ad hoc networks with imperfect channel estimation","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05376S","chronDate":"11-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153335","isNumber":"5156507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153335","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5156507","articleId":"5156522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5156525,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Harnessing the power of Ireland's large indigenous wind resource will make the security of electricity supply more resilient against fluctuations in international energy markets. In order for customers and suppliers to fully exploit the potential benefits offered by large amounts of wind power it will be necessary to offer dynamic pricing tariffs such as time-of-use tariffs and real-time-pricing to the domestic market. These time based tariffs are becoming increasing feasible as Ireland embarks on the nationwide roll-out of smart metering. In conjunction with the aforementioned tariffs, smart metering could allow customers to self-regulate their electricity usage behaviour in a more favourable manner that ultimately promotes the increased penetration of wind generated electricity. The following analysis looks at the potential of these tariffs as our generation portfolio moves from 11% to 40% renewable energy supply.","doi":"10.1109/ISSST.2009.5156783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSST.2009.5156783","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5129253/5156678/05156783.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increased penetration of wind generated electricity using real time pricing & demand side management","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Increased penetration of wind generated electricity using real time pricing & demand side management","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5156783/","accessionNumber":"10749807","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156783/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased penetration of wind generated electricity using real time pricing & demand side management","confLoc":"Tempe, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"97_PDF_Manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039258S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5129253","isNumber":"5156678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5129253","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5156678","articleId":"5156783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5156820,"authors":[{"name":"Yasushi Matsumoto","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37331652700"},{"name":"Katsumi Fujii","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37328138800"},{"name":"Akira Sugiura","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Sugiura","id":"37340831100"},{"name":"Takahide Murakami","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan","KDD Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Japan"],"lastName":"Takahide Murakami","id":"37416591000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2976-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"}],"articleNumber":"5156820","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Personal communication networks","Bit error rate","Clocks","Degradation","Frequency estimation","OFDM","Ultra wideband technology","Electromagnetic analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","electromagnetic interference","error statistics","frequency modulation","harmonic analysis","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication channels","ultra wideband communication","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic noise","MB-OFDM UWB system","bit error rate","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra wideband communication","numerical simulation","PC noise","harmonic component","data-rate communication","frequency modulation","PC clock signal","spread spectrum clocking","BER degradation","power spectral density","interference mitigation","Viterbi decoding","channel state information","UWB receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EMI","interference mitigation","OFDM","platform interference","spread spectrum clock","UWB"]}],"abstract":"The impact of electromagnetic noises from a PC on the bit error rate (BER) performance of a multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra wideband (UWB) communication system equipped on the PC is analyzed. The results of numerical simulation indicate that the PC noise consisting of the harmonic components of the PC clock causes considerable bit error rate (BER) degradation in the UWB system particularly those systems operated in high data-rate communication modes. It is also found that the frequency modulation of a PC clock signal, the so-called spread spectrum clocking (SSC), has no effect on mitigating BER degradation, although SSC techniques are commonly used in PCs for reducing the power spectral density of radiated noise. An interference mitigation scheme using Viterbi decoding with channel state information (CSI) is proposed on the basis of a novel receiver structure in which a reference PC clock signal is fed into the UWB receiver by the PC in order to accurately estimate the instantaneous frequency of interfering clock harmonics.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156820","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05156820.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","startPage":"430","endPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of electromagnetic noises from PCs on the performance of MB-OFDM UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of electromagnetic noises from PCs on the performance of MB-OFDM UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156820/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749458","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156820/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of electromagnetic noises from PCs on the performance of MB-OFDM UWB systems","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569173303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045088S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5156820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156829,"authors":[{"name":"Harmoko Habibi Roni","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Harmoko Habibi Roni","id":"37568550600"},{"name":"Shyue-Win Wei","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyue-Win Wei","id":"37335467700"},{"name":"Yih-Haw Jan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yih-Haw Jan","id":"37570322800"},{"name":"Tung-Chou Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tung-Chou Chen","id":"37438604300"},{"name":"Jyh-Horng Wen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Horng Wen","id":"37278936100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2976-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"}],"articleNumber":"5156829","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Silicon carbide","Fading","Interference cancellation","Computational complexity","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Filters","OFDM modulation","Degradation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity equalizer","high-mobility OFDM system","successive interference cancellation technique","inter-carrier interference mitigation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","computational complexity","SIC detection performance","high-speed mobile communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","equalizer","SIC","multi-path fading channel"]}],"abstract":"A well-known interference cancellation technique called successive interference cancellation (SIC) has been proved to have an excellent performance for mitigating inter-carrier interference (ICI) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. However, since the complexity of SIC is proportional to the number of OFDM subcarriers N, the realization of this detector become impractical, especially when large number of subcarriers is considered.

The presented low complexity modified SIC algorithm is referred to as qSIC equalizer since only the dominant ICI term is considered.

The increasing number of these broadband services will require higher data rates that are not achievable in many of today's cable networks. The development of DVB-C2 has been finalized recently, providing an opportunity to upgrade these networks. One main reason for the increased spectral efficiency of DVB-C2 in comparison to DVB-C is the application of OFDM. Besides the higher spectral efficiency OFDM provides further advantages in terms of flexibility and robustness, which makes it an interesting choice for the second generation DVB cable transmission system.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156967","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05156967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","startPage":"312","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of OFDM in the second generation DVB digital cable standard (DVB-C2)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of OFDM in the second generation DVB digital cable standard (DVB-C2)","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156967/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749605","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of OFDM in the second generation DVB digital cable standard (DVB-C2)","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569181417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038986S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5156967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5156968,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In MIMO-OFDM systems, channel estimation and signal detection are important to distinguish transmit signals from multiple transmit antennas. Previously, we have proposed a parallel detection algorithm using multiple QR decompositions with permuted channel matrix (MQRDPCM) for MIMO-OFDM to reduce the system complexity. This method achieves a good BER performance with low system complexity. However, since MQRD-PCM is a kind of parallel detection method, the wrong detection probability is increased due to the bad channel SINR of the transmitted signals. As a result, the average BER performance is influenced by the wrong detection probability of the bad channel SINR. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a high time resolution carrier interferometry (HTRCI) with channel ranking based joint signal detection for MQRD-PCM/MIMO-OFDM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156977","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05156977.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"783","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HTRCI with channel ranking based joint signal detection for MQRD-PCM/MIMO-OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"HTRCI with channel ranking based joint signal detection for MQRD-PCM/MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156977/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749615","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156977/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HTRCI with channel ranking based joint signal detection for MQRD-PCM/MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569181501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049988S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5156977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5156980,"authors":[{"name":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","id":"37291209500"},{"name":"Fuh-Hsin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronic & Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fuh-Hsin Huang","id":"37576608000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2976-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"}],"articleNumber":"5156980","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Channel estimation","Detectors","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Time domain analysis","Computer simulation","TV interference","Communication standards","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference detector","OFDM systems","DFT","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Orothogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","channel estimation","strong interference","Discrete Fourier transform DFT"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a DFT-based channel estimation (CE) with an interference detector is proposed for OFDM systems.

The hardware can run at 97.276 MHz, and suffers from a slight implementation loss of less than 0.1 dB at 8% PLER, in comparison to the floating-point simulation.

In contrast to conventional communication systems, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) encoder which is composed of a selectable CRC bank is placed in front of the encryptor in the proposed design. After each incoming data packet, the calculated CRC codes together with the input data packet are sent to the encryptor. Since the selection line of CRC bank can extend the key length, the CRC code is used to both enhance data security and provide data error detection. The cryptanalyses on brute-force attack indicate that the proposed design is a strict cipher and has higher security than the conventional one. Moreover, the computer simulation shows that the proposed design has a good ability in error detection and the detection ability is enhanced when the longer length of CRC code is employed.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156995","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05156995.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrating channel coding and cryptography design for OFDM based WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5156995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An integrating channel coding and cryptography design for OFDM based WLANs","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5156995/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749633","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5156995/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrating channel coding and cryptography design for OFDM based WLANs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569181623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075794S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5156995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5156998,"authors":[{"name":"Juinn-Horng Deng","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Juinn-Horng Deng","id":"37406883600"},{"name":"Shu-Min Liao","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shu-Min Liao","id":"37396963100"},{"name":"Yu-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Wei Kuo","id":"37570965700"},{"name":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","id":"37280973600"},{"name":"Yu-Lun Chiu","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Lun Chiu","id":"37292303500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2976-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"}],"articleNumber":"5156998","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"A joint estimation and compensation algorithm of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling clock offset (SCO) is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under multipath fading channels.

Specially, power systems have more Distributed Generation, which installs near the consumer, increasingly. The resources of Distributed Generation are more clean and economical than conventional generation and fit into the variable power demand. Generally, Distributed Generator installs in consumer or near consumer for reducing transmission cost. The large-scale Distributed Generators connect with Power Company, and supplies electrical power energy to consumer via power grid. On the contrary, small-scale renewable energy resources in consumer side can supply the electrical power to the local consumer and other consumers, which connect with power system. The change of the power system configuration needs for development of the equipment that controls and/or monitoring the power system. There are too many efforts in development of the monitor and control the power system. From these results lead to develop the EMS (Energy Management System) and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system. Nevertheless, these systems are too huge and too expensive to install in consumer side that works with small-scale renewable energy source. From that reason, it is need that develop a small size and inexpensive equipment that role of EMS or SCADA. In this paper describes development process of the inexpensive monitoring equipment that works with Distributed Generator at consumer side, and shows validity of measuring data. The roles of developed equipment is measuring voltage/current and storing measured data into hard disk drives in the general PC via USB communication. Further, that is calculating active/reactive power and detecting abnormal conditions and communicates with a higher control system.","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5157013","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05157013.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5157013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of data acquisition and communication equipment for micro-grid system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157013/","displayDocTitle":"Study of data acquisition and communication equipment for micro-grid system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10749651","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5157013/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of data acquisition and communication equipment for micro-grid system","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569181711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046087S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5157013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5157018,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","id":"37280973600"},{"name":"Rih-Lung Chung","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rih-Lung Chung","id":"37279370700"},{"name":"Tsung-Hui Liao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsung-Hui Liao","id":"37570095400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2975-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2976-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0747-668X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1423"}],"articleNumber":"5157018","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM","Channel estimation","Polynomials","Hardware","Interference","Degradation","Frequency domain analysis","Consumer electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fast Fourier transforms","iterative methods","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint maximum likelihood estimation","carrier frequency offset","OFDM transmission channel","channel model","symbol timing error","linear least squares channel estimator","projection matrix","polynomial approach","iterative zoom-FFT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","carrier frequency offset (CFO)","OFDM","zoom-FFT","polynomial approach"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of joint estimation of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel response for OFDM systems. In deriving the solution of the joint maximum likelihood (JML) estimator, the channel model absorbs the effects of the unknown carrier phase offset and symbol timing error. It is shown that a highly efficient JML algorithm can be cleverly obtained in two steps, consisting of a nonlinear JML-CFO estimator and a linear least squares channel estimator. Especially, the complexity of the JML-CFO estimation can be greatly reduced by exploiting the idempotent property of the projection matrix and using a polynomial approach to transform a brute-force searching into a simple coarse FFT peak finding operation. Finer CFO resolution can then be obtained by iterative zoom-FFT.

In particular, in order to suppress the IBI in the power-line communication (PLC) channel, we introduce a novel technique called lifting-trailing-zeros (LTZ). The power line channel is time-varying due to the appliances connected to outlets since appliances often exhibit input impedance that is a function of the instantaneous amplitude of the mains voltage which results in a periodically time-varying channel response. We here propose a discrete time-varying block channel model in the time domain, which allows for more realistic evaluation of modulation and coding strategies as well as for the design of bit loading strategies that can be resilient to the peculiar type of distortion in this harsh medium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power line network simulator for bistatic channel capacity with water-filling which is compared with constant power bit-loading algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Algorithm design and analysis","Channel capacity","Home appliances","Intersymbol interference","Frequency","Costs","Impedance","Voltage","Time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","electric impedance","modulation coding","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLC network design","bit loading algorithm","bistatic channel capacity","block transmission","infer-symbol interference","frequency-selective time-dispersive channels","interblock interference","power-line communication channel","lifting trailing zeros","input impedance","discrete time-varying block channel model","time domain model","modulation","coding strategy","power line network simulator","water filling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block transmission","bistatic channel capacity","bit loading algorithm","lifting-trailing-zeros (LTZ)","interblock interference (IBI)","power-line communications (PLC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157065","doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5157065","startPage":"447","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5109426/5156791/05157065.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCE.2009.5157065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157065/","displayDocTitle":"Innovative PLC network design for bit loading algorithm and bistatic channel capacity","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 May 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10749703","htmlLink":"/document/5157065/","conferenceDate":"25-28 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Innovative PLC network design for bit loading algorithm and bistatic channel capacity","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569183831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040855S","chronDate":"25-28 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109426","isNumber":"5156791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109426","xplore-issue":"5156791","articleId":"5157065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5157404,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Fei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada","Key Lab of Power Electronics & Motion Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Maanshan, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yan-Fei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279410900"},{"name":"Xiaodong Liu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Power Electronics & Motion Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Maanshan, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539075200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157404","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent developments in digital control strategies for DC/DC switching power converters","abstract":"In this paper, an overview of recent advances in digital control of low to medium power DC/DC switching converters is presented.

By using SVM, the switching frequency is kept constant and it is easy to solve the problems such as neutral point balance, voltage jump, etc, and more accurate results are obtained. A novel speed adaptive flux observer is proposed in this paper, which can observe flux and rotor speed accurately over a wide speed range. FLC is employed in the outer speed loop to provide excellent dynamic performance and steady state accuracy, especially for variable load changes. Large starting current is one of the problems in application for indirect torque control. By using pre-excitation technique and a ramp function, the stator flux is firstly established smoothly before motor starts, thus starting current is decreased while maintaining enough starting torque. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the techniques proposed in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157455.pdf","startPage":"589","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless 3-level inverter-fed induction motor drive based on indirect torque control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motor drives","Torque control","Support vector machines","Inverters","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fuzzy logic","Sensorless control","Switching frequency","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","induction motor drives","PWM invertors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensorless 3-level inverter-fed induction motor drive","indirect torque control","space vector modulation","speed adaptive flux observer","fuzzy logic controller","switching frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless 3-level inverter-fed induction motor drive based on indirect torque control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5157455/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761197","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless 3-level inverter-fed induction motor drive based on indirect torque control","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3A0144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065642S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5157486,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Josifovic","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Conversion, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Josifovic","id":"37704409100"},{"name":"Jelena Popovic-Gerber","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Conversion, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jelena","lastName":"Popovic-Gerber","id":"38273396300"},{"name":"Jan Abraham Ferreira","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Conversion, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jan Abraham","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37274813000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157486","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157486","abstract":"Current passive components construction technologies and power converters manufacturing methods are the main barriers limiting the power density improvement.

Depending on the number of stack layers (x-layers) and the components loss density, various arrangements in the Power Sandwich converter is possible. A Power Sandwich demonstrator, 70W flyback converter, is designed and implemented using modified standard components representing the prototype of x-dimension components.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are two popular methods for their advantages such as gradient-free and ability to find global optima. Due to the fact that the machine design models are sometimes computationally intense, it is important for the optimization algorithms used in the design practice to have high computational efficiency. This paper uses the design of a Surface Mount Permanent Magnet (SMPM) machine with an analytical model as a benchmark and compares the performance of PSO and GA in terms of their accuracy, the robustness to population size and algorithm coefficients. The results show that PSO has advantages over GA on those aspects and is preferred over GA when time is a limiting factor.

The authors emphasized the necessity and capability of full DC power systems in the significance of technology and energy saving, so that safer, more reliable, stable, flexible and controllable DC power grids could serve the people better than that of the present AC power systems. Presented brief structure of full DC power system where DC power would be produced from multi-phase generator-rectifier group in power station, consumers take power from DC bus, which benefits motor control and energy flow between loads connected the same DC bus without 3 phase balance problems, and DC-DC converters based Duty-Cycle control implement commutations at two terminals of HVDC transmission lines, which reduce the technical difficulties than that in 3-phase AC commutation station. Non-crystal material with about 15 kHz of frequency could be selected for advanced isolators, so as to get smallest power consumption. Some new technology lifting DC voltage in geometrical progression was suggested to be available at the sent terminal of HVDC line. With the development of renewable power systems and their energy storages, DC interconnection grids could be a better choice than AC interconnection grids because no frequency and phase shift problems need to be considered. Bulky 3-phase transformer with industrial frequency and vary kinds of compensators for AC power qualities could be saved. The authors suggested scientific policy for economically implementing full DC power systems step by step. It could be predicted that people would see 3 kinds of power systems, full AC, full DC and hybrid AC-DC systems operating simultaneously by the middle of 21 century.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157564.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1195","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction on future DC power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Power system reliability","Power system analysis computing","Power system interconnection","Hybrid power systems","Frequency","Industrial power systems","Control systems","Power generation","Commutation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","power systems","rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC power system","power energy quality","power grids","multi-phase generator-rectifier group","DC-DC converters","duty-cycle control","HVDC line"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC converter","energy saving","full DC power system","multi-phase generator-rectifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Prediction on future DC power system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5157564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761306","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction on future DC power system","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"6D0185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053893S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5157602,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Rectangular (also named as phase-shifted) modulation method on DAB has been widely studied and but other two proposed modulations (trapezoidal and triangular methods) have much less applications. Due to the characteristics of the modulation principles, one of these three methods outperforms the other two in certain operating ranges from system efficiency point of view. This paper summarizes the properties of three modulation methods and optimizes the combined use of three modulations on a DAB converter (12 V/360 V, 1 kW and 25 kHz) in order to obtain the best system efficiencies over full converter operating range. A validated loss model is utilized as the analyzing platform, based on which the optimal operating ranges of three modulations are determined.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal operating ranges of three modulation methods in dual active bridge converters","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157602","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157602.pdf","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal operating ranges of three modulation methods in dual active bridge converters","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5157602/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761343","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal operating ranges of three modulation methods in dual active bridge converters","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"2D0152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071686S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5157608,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuki Sugahara","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki Daigaku, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Sugahara","id":"37576734900"},{"name":"Shinsuke Oida","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki Daigaku, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Oida","id":"37541476900"},{"name":"Tomoki Yokoyama","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki Daigaku, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37275594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157608","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital control","Field programmable gate arrays","Power electronics","Digital signal processing","Hardware","Multiplexing","Programmable logic devices","Microprocessors","Parallel processing","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","control engineering computing","control system synthesis","digital control","digital-analogue conversion","field programmable gate arrays","power electronics","programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA controller","digital control","power electronics applications","programmable logic device","parallel processing hardware circuit","controller board","DSP","CPU","Cyclone III","D-A converter","frequency 2 MHz","voltage 3.3 V","voltage 5 V"]}],"abstract":"Recently, progress of PLD (programmable logic device) like FPGA or CPLD makes it realize the digital control system of power electronics without microprocessor (CPU or DSP).

Compared to the traditional two-level inverter, the three-level inverter using SVM control has superior performance though bringing about much computational complexity. Therefore, the FPGA-based implementation could solve this problem well. The SVM algorithm for three-level inverter is described, including the approach to calculate the dwell times of each switching state using volt-second characteristic, the algorithm of determining the space vector location and the principle for selecting switching sequences to generate symmetrical PWM output waves.

As a result, the d- and q-axis currents of the synchronous reference frame have periodic ripples of the stator fundamental frequency in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drives.

The simulation results show the good performance for the system by using recurrent neural network to adjust the parameters of neural network on-line dynamically on the condition of variety of system parameter and the impact of external load.","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157692","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157692.pdf","startPage":"1832","endPage":"1835","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PMLSM recurrent neural network compensation simulation study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"PMLSM recurrent neural network compensation simulation study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10761433","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5157692/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PMLSM recurrent neural network compensation simulation study","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3B0613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042479S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5157694,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Sun","affiliation":["School of electrical and information engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Sun","id":"37576281000"},{"name":"Huangqiu Zhu","affiliation":["School of electrical and information engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"lastName":"Huangqiu Zhu","id":"37534141900"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["School of electrical and information engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"lastName":"Tao Zhang","id":"37399941300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157694","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157694","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnet motors","Magnetic levitation","Artificial neural networks","Rotors","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Force control","Torque control","Control systems","Mathematics","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","machine control","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear decoupling control","bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motor","rotor suspension","artificial neural networks inverse system","2-order linear displacement subsystems","linear 1-order speed subsystem","servo robust controller","linear closed-loop controller"]}],"abstract":"A innovative 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motor (BPMSM) is a multi-variable, nonlinear and strong-coupled system.

RNN which has self feed back of the hidden neurons ensures that the outputs of RNN contain the whole past information of the system even if the inputs of RNN are only the present states and inputs of the system. The RNABC system is comprised of a back stepping controller and a robust controller. The back stepping controller containing an RNN uncertainty observer is the principal controller, and the robust controller is designed to dispel the effect of approximation error introduced by the uncertainty observer.

Finite element method (FEM) can solve the above problems, but it has disadvantage of considering single coil type in one model. Therefore Uniform Field and Circuit Coupled FEM (UFCCFEM) is proposed in this article. It adds additional variable loop-current into external circuit equations to form systematic coupled equations, which can fully consider solid coil eddy current influence and stranded coil current linear distribution influence. This method has less simulation time than pure eddy FEM model and more accurate short-circuit current transient characteristic than pure transient FEM. Perform this method on a certain aeronautic AC power synchronous generator, eddy current and electric potential transient waveforms are obtained and compare with experimental values to verify the correctness of the method. Spatial flux linkage transient distribution plot also show that UFCCFEM can conveniently consider transient armature reactance towards magnetic field. This method has been successfully applied on synchronous generator short-circuit fault analysis of constant speed and frequency aeronautic AC power.","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157736","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","startPage":"2057","endPage":"2061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform Field and Circuit Coupled Finite Element Method for short-circuit transient eddy analysis on aeronautic AC power synchronous generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Uniform Field and Circuit Coupled Finite Element Method for short-circuit transient eddy analysis on aeronautic AC power synchronous generator","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157736/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761477","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5157736/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform Field and Circuit Coupled Finite Element Method for short-circuit transient eddy analysis on aeronautic AC power synchronous generator","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"5D0799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03873S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5157750,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xue","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, China"],"lastName":"Yong Xue","id":"37087816487"},{"name":"Jiamei Deng","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University, UK"],"lastName":"Jiamei Deng","id":"37087820137"},{"name":"Shuangbao Ma","affiliation":["College of Electronic Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, China"],"lastName":"Shuangbao Ma","id":"37087520045"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157750","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow control","Distributed control","Inverters","Switches","Control systems","Power control","Voltage control","Impedance","Automotive engineering","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","invertors","power grids","reactive power control","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive power flow control","distributed generation unit","micro-grid","utility grid","inverter control","static var compensation units"]}],"abstract":"Distributed generation units in micro-grid can be connected to utility grid as alternative energy sources besides providing power to their local loads.

In order to monitoring the PQ of distributed generators in real-time, an efficient method for tracking power harmonic parameters is presented in this paper. Firstly, a state-space model used for non-stationary harmonic analysis is constructed based on the definition of instantaneous frequency, in which, amplitudes and phases are taken as states and frequencies as time-varying parameters of a dynamic system. Thereafter, the harmonic tracking problem can be considered as estimating the states and parameters simultaneously. To solve this problem, a prediction error minimization (PEM) based algorithm was proposed and evaluated using computer simulations. The experimental results proved that the algorithm is not sensitive to frequency or amplitude variation and converges very fast.","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157816","startPage":"2459","endPage":"2463","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089256/5157395/05157816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5157395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient frequency and amplitude tracking method for real-time power quality monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient frequency and amplitude tracking method for real-time power quality monitoring","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5157816/","accessionNumber":"10761557","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5157816/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient frequency and amplitude tracking method for real-time power quality monitoring","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"5D0838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036358S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089256","isNumber":"5157395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089256","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5157395","articleId":"5157816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5157832,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Fujita","affiliation":["Core Technology Development Center,Home Appliances Company, Panasonic Corporation, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37405509900"},{"name":"Hideki Sadakata","affiliation":["Core Technology Development Center,Home Appliances Company, Panasonic Corporation, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Sadakata","id":"37330388100"},{"name":"Izuo Hirota","affiliation":["IH Cooking Equipment Business Unit,Home Appliances Company, Panasonic Corporation, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Izuo","lastName":"Hirota","id":"37284816700"},{"name":"Hideki Omori","affiliation":["Core Technology Development Center,Home Appliances Company, Panasonic Corporation, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Omori","id":"37284817400"},{"name":"Mutsuo Nakaoka","affiliation":["Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan","Kyungnam University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mutsuo","lastName":"Nakaoka","id":"37275124400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3556-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3557-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5157832","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1058},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant inverters","Home appliances","Hafnium","Switching frequency","Conductivity","Aluminum","Steel","Resonant frequency","Iron","Induction generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domestic appliances","induction heating","resonant invertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency series load resonant inverter","built-in cooktop","induction heated all metallic appliances","soft-switching high-frequency inverter","one-stage boost-half bridge inverter","lossless snubbing capacitor","dual SLR frequency selection strategy","low resistivity metallic pan-utensil","stainless steel","home energy utilization","electricity residential system","consumer power electronic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High frequency resonant inverter","Boost-half bridge topology","Triple series resonant frequency-operated mode","Induction-heated all metallic appliances","Consumer power electronics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5157832","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2009.5157832","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 6th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference","abstract":"This paper deals with the 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n generation prototype of one-stage boost-half bridge (B-HB) series load resonant (SLR) soft-switching high-frequency (HF) inverter with a lossless snubbing capacitor for a variety of induction heating (IH) appliances.

A current enhancement layer was adopted to reduce the forward voltage drop for each IGBTs. For the asymmetric IGBT, it was found that the frequency capability of the device was affected most by adjusting the buffer region parameters such as doping concentration, thickness, and lifetime. For the symmetric IGBT, the p+ substrate doping concentration and drift region lifetime were investigated to obtain maximum switching frequency capability. A comparison of frequency capabilities between power MOSFETs, asymmetric, and symmetric IGBTs has been made.

With future multi-core processors expected to require >1TB/s bandwidth and dramatically improved power efficiency, there has been some question as to whether electrical I/O will continue to satisfy chip-to-chip communication requirements over the next decade. In this paper, we show that electrical signaling has the power, performance, and density scaling potential to enable the next several generations of systems and applications. Circuit innovation is aggressively pushing link power efficiency toward 1-2mW/Gb/s while departures from legacy channels to include new topologies and materials can significantly improve the power/performance/density tradeoff. Statistical link-level design tools that allow designers to rapidly quantify high-level architecture tradeoffs will enable balanced link designs that co-optimize power, performance, and channel topology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158087/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10762133","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158087/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The future of electrical I/O for microprocessors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The future of electrical I/O for microprocessors","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"IS21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059814S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5128899","isNumber":"5158074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5128899","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5158074","articleId":"5158087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5158106,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Carrion Schafer","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation EDA R and D Center, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Benjamin Carrion","lastName":"Schafer","id":"37409945500"},{"name":"Takashi Takenaka","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation EDA R and D Center, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Takashi Takenaka","id":"37575046900"},{"name":"Kazutoshi Wakabayashi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation EDA R and D Center, Kawasaki, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazutoshi Wakabayashi","id":"37265562900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2781-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2782-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158106","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"abstract":"This paper presents a microarchitectural design space exploration tool called cwbexplorer based on an Adaptive Simulated Annealer Exploration Algorithm (ASA-ExpA) for behavioral descriptions written in untimed C or SystemC.

A commercial high level synthesis tool (Cy- berWorkBench) is used to synthesize each new architecture. The ASA-ExpA searches the design space based on the results of the previous synthesis, the global cost function and the given constraints. The global cost function weights are adaptively modified during the exploration to adjust the objective to minimize area or latency. Experimental results show that cwbexplorer successfully searches the design space fast and efficiently finding the smallest and fastest designs for most benchmarks, incurring in small penalties (5% in area and 8% in latency) for larger benchmarks while reducing the total runtime by an average of 66% compared to a brute force approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","pdfPath":"/iel5/5128899/5158074/05158106.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Simulated Annealer for high level synthesis design space exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","High level synthesis","Space exploration","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","High level languages","Delay","Cost function","Timing","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive simulated annealer","high level synthesis design space exploration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Simulated Annealer for high level synthesis design space exploration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158106/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10762149","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Simulated Annealer for high level synthesis design space exploration","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095448S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5128899","isNumber":"5158074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5128899","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5158074","articleId":"5158106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5158109,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Wu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wu Lin","id":"37309462800"},{"name":"Pin-Dai Sue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pin-Dai Sue","id":"37568140400"},{"name":"Ya-Ting Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ya-Ting Shyu","id":"37572714500"},{"name":"Soon-Jyh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Soon-Jyh Chang","id":"37281064400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2781-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2782-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158109","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Circuit simulation","Equations","Transistors","Voltage","Process design","System-on-a-chip","Analog circuits","Design optimization","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential amplifiers","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistor-level automation","fully-differential operational amplifier design","lookup-table-based scheme","layout generation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a transistor-level automation to perform component sizing, power optimization and layout generation for fully-differential operational amplifiers (op-amps).

multiplexing (OFDM) achieve high spectral efficiency high channel capacity, and many MIMO-OFDM systems use the spatial multiplexing technique to improve the system performance. The MIMO-OFDM systems require the singular values and the corresponding singular vectors of the channel matrix by exploiting singular value decomposition (SVD). The information of the right singular-vector matrix can be fed back to the transmitter for linear precoding to improve the error performance when facing the channel matrix with rank deficiency problem. This work proposes a SVD algorithm with fast convergence speed, which is suitable for the MIMO channels with short coherent time. The proposed SVD algorithm has the following features: (1) low total computational complexity, (2) fast convergence speed, (3) the ability of reconfigurable to different numbers of transmitter and receiver antennas, and (4) insensitive to the dynamic range problem, which is suitable for hardware implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-convergence-speed low-computation-complexity SVD algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158128","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test","pdfPath":"/iel5/5128899/5158074/05158128.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2009.5158128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-convergence-speed low-computation-complexity SVD algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158128/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10762169","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-convergence-speed low-computation-complexity SVD algorithm for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"T22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043487S","chronDate":"28-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5128899","isNumber":"5158074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5128899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5158074","articleId":"5158128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158134,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Yu Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Yu Chang","id":"37539046000"},{"name":"Che-Wei Fan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Che-Wei Fan","id":"37577215500"},{"name":"Shen-Iuan Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-Iuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280143000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2781-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2782-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158134","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"abstract":"A frequency synthesizer for Mode-1 MB-OFDM UWB applications is realized in 65 nm CMOS.

The prosthesis evolution had allowed people who lost an extremity to win back their normal life and live it with fewer limitations. Designing a myoelectric prosthetic arm that interacts with the amputee requires the integration of countless disciplines. Traditional commercial prosthesis has at least three degrees of freedom: open and close the hook, bend and straighten the elbow and rotate the wrist; but the human arm has 22 degrees of freedom. Thus, it is important to realize that the prosthetics have a long way to go. Furthermore, the higher the amputation level, the greater the demands on the fitting technique. Each prosthesis has different characteristics, advantages and drawbacks. Finally, four different kind of prosthesis will be presented: the Boston Elbow, the Utah Arm, the Kuiken's Prosthesis within DARPA's Project and the prosthesis under development in our laboratory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158375/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10762012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Upper limb prostheses for amputations above elbow: A review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Upper limb prostheses for amputations above elbow: A review","confLoc":"Mexico City","sourcePdf":"64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040912S","chronDate":"16-20 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5109423","isNumber":"5158333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5109423","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5158333","articleId":"5158375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5158386,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In a multi-hop cognitive network, this problem becomes even worse since multiple links are involved. Spectrum handoff of multiple links seriously affects the network connectivity and routing. In this paper, we describe a cross-layer optimization approach to solve the spectrum handoff problem with joint consideration of spectrum handoff scheduling and routing. We propose a protocol, called Joint Spectrum Handoff Scheduling and Routing Protocol (JSHRP). This paper makes the following major contributions. First, the concept \"spectrum handoff of single link\" is extended to \"spectrum handoff of multiple links\", termed as \"multi-link spectrum handoff\". Second, we define the problem of coordinating the spectrum handoff of multiple links to minimize the total spectrum handoff latency under the constraint of the network connectivity. This problem is proven to be NP-hard, and we propose both centralized and distributed greedy algorithms to minimize the total latency of spectrum handoff for multiple links in a multi-hop cognitive network. Moreover, we jointly design the rerouting mechanism with spectrum handoff scheduling algorithm to improve the network throughput. Different from previous works in which rerouting is performed after spectrum handoff, our rerouting mechanism is executed before the spectrum handoff really happens. Simulation results show that JSHRP improves the network performance by 50% and the higher degree of interference the cognitive network experiences, the more improvement our solution will bring to the network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158393","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158392/5158393/05158412.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Spectrum Handoff Scheduling and Routing in Multi-hop Multi-radio Cognitive Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158412/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Spectrum Handoff Scheduling and Routing in Multi-hop Multi-radio Cognitive Networks","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10762389","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization of Spectrum Handoff Scheduling and Routing in Multi-hop Multi-radio Cognitive Networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3659a085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064064S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158392","isNumber":"5158393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158392","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5158393","articleId":"5158412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5158435,"authors":[{"name":"Siyao Cheng","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Siyao","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37402283600"},{"name":"Jianzhong Li","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jianzhong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279856300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3659-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"5158435","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":545},"abstract":"Aggregation operations are important for users to get summarization information in WSN applications. As large numbers of applications only require approximate aggregation results rather than the exact ones, some approximate aggregation algorithms are proposed to save energy. However, the error bounds of these algorithms are fixed and it is impossible to adjust their error bounds automatically. Therefore, these algorithms cannot reach arbitrary precision requirement given by user. This paper proposes a sampling based approximate aggregation algorithm to satisfy the requirement of arbitrary precision. Besides, two sample data adaptive algorithms are also provided. One is to adapt the sample with the varying of precision requirement. The other is to adapt the sample with the varying of the sensed data in networks. The theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and energy cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wireless sensor networks","Costs","Monitoring","Filters","Inference algorithms","Distributed computing","Sensor systems and applications","Computer errors","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","aggregation","approximation theory","error statistics","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","sampling based-approximate aggregation","save energy","error bounds","arbitrary precision","data adaptive algorithms","energy cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor network","sampling","approximate aggregation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2009.8","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158392/5158393/05158435.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Based (epsilon, delta)-Approximate Aggregation Algorithm in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Based (epsilon, delta)-Approximate Aggregation Algorithm in Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158435/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158435/","accessionNumber":"10750680","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Based (epsilon, delta)-Approximate Aggregation Algorithm in Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3659a273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062153S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158392","isNumber":"5158393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158392","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5158393","articleId":"5158435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5158439,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291623900"},{"name":"Yan Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37404900300"},{"name":"Klara Nahrstedt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Klara","lastName":"Nahrstedt","id":"37280846400"},{"name":"Wenbo He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"He","id":"37288549600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3659-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"5158439","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Content based retrieval","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","file servers","optimisation","telecommunication network topology","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-tolerant content distribution community","WiFi-based content distribution community infrastructure","file servers","mean file retrieval probability","storage capacity constraints","optimal caching strategy","mobility patterns","access point topology","file popularity","content management problem","mixed integer optimization problem","NPhardness","MobaSsign","file blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay Tolerant Network","Content Distribution","Optimization","Mobility Pattern"]}],"abstract":"In WiFi-based content distribution community infrastructure (CDCI), file servers are deployed in diverse locations around cities, caching popular files interesting to a community.

They are able to provide the same reliability as replication requiring much less storage space. Erasure coding breaks the data into pieces that are encoded and then stored on different nodes. However, when storage nodes permanently abandon the system, new redundant pieces must be created. For erasure codes, generating a new piece requires the transmission of k pieces over the network, resulting in a k times higher reconstruction traffic as compared to replication. Dimakis proposed a new class of codes, called regenerating codes, which are able to provide both the storage efficiency of erasure codes and the communication efficiency of replication. However, Dimakis gave only a theoretical description of the codes without discussing implementation issues or computational costs. We have done a real implementation of random linear regenerating codes that allows us to measure their computational cost, which can be significant if the parameters are not chosen properly. However, we also find that there exist parameter values that result in a significant reduction of the communication overhead at the expense of a small increase in storage cost and computation, which makes these codes very attractive for distributed storage systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2009.14","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158392/5158393/05158447.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Study of Regenerating Codes for Peer-to-Peer Backup Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158447/","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Study of Regenerating Codes for Peer-to-Peer Backup Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158447/","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Study of Regenerating Codes for Peer-to-Peer Backup Systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3659a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053774S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158392","isNumber":"5158393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158392","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5158393","articleId":"5158447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158464,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Li","id":"37307494900"},{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279156600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3659-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"5158464","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Disruption tolerant networking","Costs","Bridges","Network topology","Delay","Protocols","Subscriptions","Distributed computing","Computer science","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","middleware","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOPS","content-based service","disruption-tolerant networks","network services","content-based protocols","static networks","unaffordable maintenance costs","mobile environment","publish/subscribe scheme","social network property","subscription interests","broker-to-broker communication scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs)","localized algorithms","publish/subscribe","social network analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158464","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2009.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158393","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158392/5158393/05158464.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOPS: Providing Content-Based Service in Disruption-Tolerant Networks","abstract":"Content-based service, which dynamically routes and delivers events from sources to interested users, is extremely important to network services. However, existing content-based protocols for static networks will incur unaffordable maintenance costs if they are applied directly to the highly mobile environment that is featured in disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs). In this paper, we propose a unique publish/subscribe scheme that utilizes the long-term social network properties, which are observed in many DTNs, to facilitate content-based services in DTNs. We distributively construct communities based on the neighboring relationships from nodes' encounter histories. Brokers are deployed to bridge the communities, and they adopt a locally prioritized pub/sub scheme which combines the structural importance with subscription interests, to decide what events they should collect, store, and propagate. Different trade-offs for content-based service can be achieved by tuning the closeness threshold in community formation or by adjusting the broker-to-broker communication scheme. Extensive real-trace and synthetic-trace driven simulation results are presented to support the effectiveness of our scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158464/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10762418","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MOPS: Providing Content-Based Service in Disruption-Tolerant Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOPS: Providing Content-Based Service in Disruption-Tolerant Networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3659a526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060409S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158392","isNumber":"5158393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158392","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5158393","articleId":"5158464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5158468,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Werner Frey","affiliation":["Systems Department, IBM Research GmbH, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Philip Werner","lastName":"Frey","id":"37409955200"},{"name":"Gustavo Alonso","affiliation":["Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Alonso","id":"37279222700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3659-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"5158468","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":634},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","TCPIP","Application software","Distributed computing","Operating systems","Ethernet networks","Hardware","Performance analysis","Switches","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","local area networks","magnetic disc storage","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote direct memory access","CPU cost","large data transfers","buffers","distributed applications","Ethernet","iWARP","TCP/IP based communication","buffer management","optimizations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RDMA","iWARP","Buffer Management","Application Suitability","Performance"]}],"abstract":"Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a mechanism whereby data is moved directly between the application memory of the local and remote computer. In bypassing the operating system, RDMA significantly reduces the CPU cost of large data transfers and eliminates intermediate copying across buffers, thereby making it very attractive for implementing distributed applications. With the advent of hardware implementations of RDMA over Ethernet (iWARP), its advantages have become even more obvious. In this paper we analyze the applicability of RDMA and identify hidden costs in the setup of its interactions that, if not handled carefully, remove any performance advantage, especially in hardware implementations. From an application point of view, the major difference to TCP/IP based communication is that the buffer management has to be done explicitly by the application. Without the proper optimizations, RDMA loses all its advantages. We discuss the problem in detail, analyze what applications can profit from RDMA, present a number of optimization strategies, and show through extensive performance experiments that these optimizations make a substantial difference in the overall performance of RDMA based applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2009.32","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158392/5158393/05158468.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158393","startPage":"553","endPage":"560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing the Hidden Cost of RDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the Hidden Cost of RDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158468/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750692","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158468/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the Hidden Cost of RDMA","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3659a553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060041S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158392","isNumber":"5158393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158392","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5158393","articleId":"5158468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5158497,"authors":[{"name":"Bhasker Jakka","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhasker","lastName":"Jakka","id":"37573172300"},{"name":"Dillip Dash","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dillip","lastName":"Dash","id":"37573180900"},{"name":"Caner Yalcin","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Caner","lastName":"Yalcin","id":"37573172700"},{"name":"Ly Dang","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ly","lastName":"Dang","id":"37583031800"},{"name":"Omar Mire","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Mire","id":"37573181800"},{"name":"Aldo Cometti","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"Cometti","id":"37573181300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3690-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"5158497","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Mathematical model","Application software","Software tools","Magnetic properties","Magnetic recording","Software prototyping","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","disc drives","field programmable gate arrays","hard discs","information retrieval","information storage","magnetic storage","optimisation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible high throughput FPGA","RW channel development","read/write channel","magnetic recording systems","hard disk drive","digital architecture","performance evaluation","HDD","information storage","information retrieval","ASIC Channel front-end","optimization","channel back-end","Matlab/C models"]}],"abstract":"It is difficult to model all effects of magnetic channel for performance simulations.

One significant problem that arises when mapping applications onto such embedded multiprocessors is the memory wall problem, which is becoming increasingly dominant in multiprocessor environments. In this paper, to help alleviate the memory wall problem, we propose a novel, high-performance buffer mapping policy for SDF-represented DSP applications on multiprocessor systems that support the shared-memory programming model. The proposed policy exploits the bank concurrency of a DRAM main memory system according to the analysis of the major forms of parallelism. The throughput is measured on both synthetic and real benchmarks. The simulation results show that the pro-posed buffer mapping policy is very useful, especially in memory-intensive applications where the total execution time of computational tasks is relatively small compared to that of memory operations. The performance improvement produced by our method is generally attained at the cost of additional banks and decreased bank utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Buffer Mapping to Exploit DRAM Concurrency in Multiprocessor DSP Systems","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2009.34","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2009.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158482","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158481/5158482/05158511.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Buffer Mapping to Exploit DRAM Concurrency in Multiprocessor DSP Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158511/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750708","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Buffer Mapping to Exploit DRAM Concurrency in Multiprocessor DSP Systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"3690a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059385S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158481","isNumber":"5158482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158481","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5158482","articleId":"5158511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158512,"authors":[{"name":"Lieu My Chuong","affiliation":["PixelMetrix Corporation Kaki Bukit Road 3, SINGAPORE"],"firstName":"Lieu My","lastName":"Chuong","id":"37872423000"},{"name":"Siew-Kei Lam","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Drive, SINGAPORE"],"firstName":"Siew-Kei","lastName":"Lam","id":"37332707100"},{"name":"Thambipillai Srikanthan","affiliation":["Centre for High Performance Embedded Systems Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Drive, SINGAPORE"],"firstName":"Thambipillai","lastName":"Srikanthan","id":"37266928200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3690-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"5158512","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Mathematical model","High level synthesis","Prototypes","Embedded system","Space technology","Space exploration","Decoding","High level languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","delay estimation","encoding","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-time estimation","controller","C-based function porting","one-hot encoding","signal decoding logic","Xilinx Spartan FPGA device","maximum delay estimation error","FSM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area-time estimation","controller","FPGA","FSM"]}],"abstract":"Rapid area-time estimation is an essential step for efficient design exploration of FPGA-based implementations. In this paper, we focus on area-time estimation of the controller for porting C-based functions onto commercial FPGA devices.

Experimental results for the Xilinx Spartan FPGA device show that the proposed model and techniques can lead to reliable area-time estimation. In particular, when compared to results from the commercial tool, the proposed area estimation strategy leads to an average absolute error of only about 10%. In addition, the maximum delay estimation error for the FSM is less than 1ns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-Time Estimation of Controller for Porting C-Based Functions onto FPGA","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2009.15","startPage":"145","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2009.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158482","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/IFIP International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158481/5158482/05158512.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Area-Time Estimation of Controller for Porting C-Based Functions onto FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158512/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750709","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-Time Estimation of Controller for Porting C-Based Functions onto FPGA","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"3690a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058898S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158481","isNumber":"5158482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158481","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5158482","articleId":"5158512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158514,"authors":[{"name":"Zahir Larabi","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM; TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Zahir","lastName":"Larabi","id":"37546041400"},{"name":"Yves Mathieu","affiliation":["Institut TELECOM; TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Mathieu","id":"37543286500"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Mancini","affiliation":["GIPSA-Lab;, INPG, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Mancini","id":"37296327800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3690-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"5158514","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Prefetching","Field programmable gate arrays","Signal processing","Random access memory","Signal processing algorithms","Cache memory","Hardware","Computer architecture","Pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","information retrieval","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data access management","FPGA","image processing","SoC","low-cost n-dimensional cache architecture","signal processing","systems on chip","structured data access","jumping snake","2D backprojection","associative caches","tracking algorithm","spacial locality","temporal locality","run-time performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA SoC","cache memory","structured data caching","Adaptative Predictive Cache","image processing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a low-cost n-dimensional cache (nD-Cache) architecture for FPGA-based image and signal processing systems on chip (SoCs).

This network is a generalization of the well known bidirectional relay channel, where we have only one pair of users. We examine this problem in the context of the deterministic channel interaction model, which eliminates the channel noise and allows us to focus on the interaction between signals. We characterize the capacity region of this network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode (with non adaptive listen-transmit scheduling). In both cases we show that the cut-set upper bound is tight and, quite interestingly, the capacity region is achieved by a simple equation-forwarding strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158541","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158541.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity region of the deterministic multi-pair bi-directional relay network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158541/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity region of the deterministic multi-pair bi-directional relay network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761626","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158541/","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity region of the deterministic multi-pair bi-directional relay network","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053969S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158547,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Saeedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37294647900"},{"name":"Hossein Pishro-Nik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Pishro-Nik","id":"38278138700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4536-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158547","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Upper bound","Belief propagation","Optimization methods","Performance analysis","Convergence of numerical methods","H infinity control","Stability analysis","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","numerical analysis","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","symmetric channel","low-density parity-check code","belief propagation decoding","binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channel","binary erasure channel","numerical method","optimization","average check node degree","channel coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158547","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158547.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On LDPC codes over symmetric channels","abstract":"In the past decade, there has been tremendous amount of research on the analysis and design of the Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with belief propagation decoding over different types of Binary-Input Output-Symmetric Memoryless (BIOSM) channels. However, with the exception of the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), analytical results on LDPC codes over such channels are limited and most results are based on numerical methods and optimization. In particular, systematic design of provably capacity achieving sequences of LDPC code ensembles over general class of BIOSM channels has remained a fundamental open problem. Such sequences have been designed only for the binary erasure channel (BEC). In this paper, we first prove some novel analytical properties of the LDPC code ensembles over BIOSM channels. In particular, we prove a result that generalizes the previously known stability condition over symmetric channels. This suggests that a modified version of the flatness condition, a property which has been shown to be critical for capacity achieving sequences over the BEC, can be used to devise capacity achieving sequences for general class of BIOSM channels. Based on this assumption, we propose a method which could result in the systematic design of such sequences over BIOSM channels. Numerical evidence is promising and provides a consistent convergence behavior to capacity over the considered BIOSM channels as the average check node degree increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158547/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761631","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On LDPC codes over symmetric channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On LDPC codes over symmetric channels","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045978S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158548,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Samuel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Samuel","id":"37394142100"},{"name":"Michael Fitz","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fitz","id":"37269771600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4536-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158548","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158548","abstract":"Two efficient iterative sphere detectors based on the Schnorr-Euchner enumeration are the topic of this manuscript.

A two-stage operation is considered where all terminals operate in half-duplex mode and where the source first transmits to a pool of N relays, each of which decides independently whether to relay the source's information to the destination or not, by comparing its own instantaneous received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to a threshold zeta. The K les N transmitting relays do so with constant transmit power per relay, and cooperate through linearly dispersed full-rate-full-diversity DSTBCs. The system concept is interesting in which no coordination amongst relays is required, and only backward channel state information (CSI) is assumed. We derive the mutual information (MI) achieved by such a scheme with Rayleigh fading at each channel branch and assuming perfect interleaving (ergodic channel). Then, we study the effect of the selected threshold onto achievableMI in the case where the source and each relay transmits with the same power. It is found that the maximal MI is not achieved under full-time-all-relay cooperation (K = N), despite the fact that the total receive power at the receiver increases with K. The maximum MI in this case can also be fitted to a simple function of N. Next, we investigate the effect of different power balances between the two transmission stages while fixing the total average transmit power. It is shown that the optimum power allocation depends on the threshold, such that the MI is maximized not with equal power allocation (and K = N), but rather with a power balance of around 2-to-3 and K < N, again, despite the fact that the total receive power at the receiver increases with K. Finally, we compare the maximum MI against the MI achieved with QPSK and QAM modulations, which reveals that the envelope behavior of the latter follows the same trend observed with the former.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Relays","Power system relaying","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Wireless communication","Information analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Channel state information","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel allocation","channel coding","diversity reception","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual information","amplify-and-forward DSTBC","random set relay channel","distributed space-time block coded system","cooperative relaying system","half-duplex mode","backward channel state information","Rayleigh fading","ergodic channel","optimum power allocation","QPSK","QAM modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158570","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158570.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual information of amplify-and-forward DSTBCs over the random set relay channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mutual information of amplify-and-forward DSTBCs over the random set relay channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158570/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158570/","accessionNumber":"10750185","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual information of amplify-and-forward DSTBCs over the random set relay channel","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050444S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5158571,"authors":[{"name":"Sibi Raj Bhaskaran","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Sibi Raj","lastName":"Bhaskaran","id":"37320703400"},{"name":"Linda Davis","affiliation":["University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, AU"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Davis","id":"37271076600"},{"name":"Alex Grant","affiliation":["University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, AU"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Grant","id":"37272161100"},{"name":"Stephen Hanly","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Hanly","id":"37269071600"},{"name":"Paul Tune","affiliation":["University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Tune","id":"37545926100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4536-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158571","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Compressed sensing","Feedback","Base stations","Australia","Broadcasting","Delay","Resource management","Performance analysis","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","cellular radio","resource allocation","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink scheduling","cellular downlink resource sharing","compressed sensing","distributed self-selection procedure","broadcast channel","access mechanism"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel access technique for cellular downlink resource sharing.

The feedback channel (the corresponding uplink) is modeled as an AWGN channel, orthogonal across users. The total bandwidth consumed is the sum of the bandwidth/resources used for downlink training, channel feedback, and data transmission. Assuming that the channel follows a block fading model and that zero-forcing beamforming is used, we optimize the net achievable rate for unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel feedback. The optimal number of downlink training pilots is seen to be essentially the same for both feedback techniques, but digital feedback is shown to provide a larger net rate than analog feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158576.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"230","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized training and feedback for MIMO downlink channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Fading","Channel state information","Bandwidth","Broadcasting","State feedback","Transmitters","Base stations","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","broadcast channels","fading channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training optimization","feedback optimization","MIMO fading broadcast channel","channel state information","AWGN channel","downlink training","channel feedback","data transmission","block fading model","zero-forcing beamforming","unquantized channel feedback","quantized channel feedback","digital feedback","analog feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimized training and feedback for MIMO downlink channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158576/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10761646","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized training and feedback for MIMO downlink channels","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063889S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158583,"authors":[{"name":"Dino Sejdinovic","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Dino","lastName":"Sejdinovic","id":"37572841600"},{"name":"Robert J.

The relaying function is memoryless, in contrast to the conventional schemes based on coding with long codewords. That is, we model the operation of the relay as a two-to-one deterministic mapping, which combines the two received analog signals from the sources. This procedure resembles the concept of network coding where information combining is applied in the intermediate nodes. However, as our mapping directly combines the received analog signals without decoding, we coin the term (memoryless) analog network coding mapping. In this paper, both linear and non-linear mappings are studied. In particular, the Archimedean spiral is used for the non-linear 2:1 mapping, inspired by similar work in the context of joint source-channel coding. We discuss both the achievable rate regions and sum rates and demonstrate significant gains of applying the proposed analog mappings in the relay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog network coding mappings in Gaussian multiple-access two-hop channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158586","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158586.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analog network coding mappings in Gaussian multiple-access two-hop channels","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158586/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog network coding mappings in Gaussian multiple-access two-hop channels","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047498S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158588,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Krikidis","id":"37275149300"},{"name":"J.

In contrast to previous methods that only focused to the distribution close to its most probable value, thus obtaining an asymptotically Gaussian distribution, we calculate the full distribution including its tails, which behave quite differently from the bulk of the distribution. Our resulting probability distribution seamlessly interpolates between the Gaussian approximation for rates R close to the ergodic value of the mutual information and the approach of Zheng and Tse [1], valid for large signal to noise ratios rho. This provides us with a tool to analytically calculate outage probabilities at any point in the (R, rho,N) parameter space, as long as the number of antennas N is not too small. In addition, this method also yields the probability distribution of eigenvalues constrained in the subspace where the mutual information per antenna is fixed to R for a given rho. Quite remarkably, this eigenvalue density is of the form of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution with square-root singularities.","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158592","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158592.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution of MIMO mutual information: A large deviations approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158592/","displayDocTitle":"Distribution of MIMO mutual information: A large deviations approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750197","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158592/","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution of MIMO mutual information: A large deviations approach","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051468S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158594,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiao","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus center School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37274412700"},{"name":"Mikael Skoglund","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus center School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Skoglund","id":"37265042800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4536-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158594","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Network coding","Relays","Fading","Decoding","Network topology","Wireless networks","Base stations","Galois fields","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","decoding","diversity reception","error detection codes","fading channels","minimisation","multiuser channels","probability","radio networks","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-user cooperative wireless communication network topology","nonbinary dynamic network code design","common base station","relay information","transmission block fading channel","finite field","channel code","error detection","channel decoder","deterministic code","min-cut scheme","outage probability","multiple-user network","diversity order"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158594","abstract":"We propose a new method of applying network coding for cooperative wireless networks. The network consists of multiple (M ges 2) users having independent information to be transmitted to a common base station (BS). These users form partners and relay information for each other. The transmission blocks are subject to block-fading with independent fading coefficients for each block. Designed non-binary network codes over finite fields are used on top of channel codes. Assuming perfect error detection, erroneous blocks out from channel decoders are discarded (erasure). Thus, relaying nodes may not have information messages of some partners (erasure in inter-user channels), and the BS may not decode some blocks correctly either. The network topology from the point of view of network coding is dynamic. To improve performance, we propose dynamic-network codes (deterministic codes for dynamic networks) for the cooperative networks. The codes are designed such that the BS can rebuild user information from a minimum possible set of coding blocks. In this sense, dynamic-network codes achieve the min-cut for cooperative networks with a dynamic topology. For block fading channels, the proposed scheme obtains high asymptotic performance. For two-user networks, we calculate the resulting outage probabilities. We also present simulations with specific channel codes. Numerical results show substantial improvement over previous schemes. Then, we generalize the results to multiple-user (M > 2) networks. We investigate the existence of deterministic dynamic-network codes for multiple-user networks, and show that the diversity order of the proposed scheme can achieve 2M - 1.","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158594","startPage":"316","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158594.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-user cooperative wireless communications based on nonbinary network codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158594/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"M-user cooperative wireless communications based on nonbinary network codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158594/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10761656","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-user cooperative wireless communications based on nonbinary network codes","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050192S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5158599,"authors":[{"name":"Masih Nilchian","affiliation":["Information Systems and Security Lab(ISSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Masih","lastName":"Nilchian","id":"37572888100"},{"name":"Vahid Aref","affiliation":["Information Systems and Security Lab(ISSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Aref","id":"37573402400"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Aref","affiliation":["Information Systems and Security Lab(ISSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Aref","id":"37300306900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4535-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4536-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158599","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"abstract":"We define partial cognitive relay channel as a two-transmitter, two-receiver interference channel with a relay node such that one of the transmitters is a cognitive transmitter. As a more feasible assumption we assume that the cognitive transmitter has non-causally access to a part of the other transmitter's encoded message. The cognitive radio transmitter transmits simultaneously over the same channel instead of waiting for an idle channel which is traditional for a cognitive radio. We calculate the achievable rate region for partial cognitive relay channel based on the combination of partial decode-compress and forward for the relay, rate-splitting and Gel'fand and Pinsker coding. Numerical evaluation of the region in the practical Gaussian case is performed. We show that by defining a proper cooperation strategy among the transmitters, equipping some of them with the cognition capability and exploiting the relay nodes, the effective bandwidth of each transmitter will enhance greatly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089338/5158522/05158599.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Networking and Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWNIT.2009.5158599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial cognitive relay channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Radio transmitters","Bandwidth","Cognitive radio","Interference channels","Decoding","Cognition","Channel capacity","Gaussian channels","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cognitive radio","Gaussian channels","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial cognitive relay channel","two-transmitter interference channel","two-receiver interference channel","cognitive transmitter","cognitive radio","partial decode-compress","Gel'fand-and Pinsker coding","numerical evaluation","Gaussian case"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Partial cognitive relay channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158599/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750198","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"12-10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial cognitive relay channel","confLoc":"Volos, Greece","sourcePdf":"0000341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084395S","chronDate":"12-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089338","isNumber":"5158522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089338","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5158522","articleId":"5158599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158610,"authors":[{"name":"Hikmet Sari","affiliation":["Sup\u00e9lec, Plateau du Moulon, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Hikmet","lastName":"Sari","id":"37269615900"},{"name":"Serdar Sezginer","affiliation":["Sequans Communications, Paris-La-Defense, France"],"firstName":"Serdar","lastName":"Sezginer","id":"37391818800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2936-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2937-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158610","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"abstract":"We first review recent developments in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques for mobile WiMAX systems and discuss full-rate and high-rate space-time codes of low decoder complexity.

Sparsity of the channel is a criterion which can highly improve the channel estimation task in mobile applications. In sparse signal processing, many efficient algorithms have been developed for finding the sparsest solution to linear equations (basis pursuit, matching pursuit) in the presence of noise. In current OFDM standards, a number of the ending subcarriers at both positive and negative frequencies are left unoccupied (for ease of analog filtering at the receiver) which results in an ill-conditioned frequency to time transformation matrix. This means that the initial estimate for the impulse response of the channel (in time) easily varies as the noise vector changes. Thus in this case we cannot use most of the proposed algorithms in sparse signal processing. In this paper, we propose iteration with adaptive thresholding and MMSE methods to overcome this difficulty. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is almost perfect for stationary channels and only minor performance degradation is observed with increase of Doppler frequency.","doi":"10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158647","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089941/5158601/05158647.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical sparse channel estimation for current OFDM standards","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158647/","displayDocTitle":"A practical sparse channel estimation for current OFDM standards","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750219","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158647/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical sparse channel estimation for current OFDM standards","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morroco","sourcePdf":"1569176398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063335S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089941","isNumber":"5158601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089941","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5158601","articleId":"5158647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158654,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Stasiak","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Stasiak","id":"37320909300"},{"name":"Piotr Zwierzykowski","affiliation":["Communication and Computer Networks, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Zwierzykowski","id":"37320910200"},{"name":"Janusz Wiewiora","affiliation":["Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa Sp. z o.o., BSS Optimization Section, Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Wiewiora","id":"37320908800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2936-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2937-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158654","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","3G mobile communication","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Resource management","Packet switching","GSM","Communications technology","Mobile communication","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UMTS network","WCDMA interface","multirate traffic","mobile operator","user differentiation","WCDMA resource management","3G mobile networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analytical modelling","WCDMA","UMTS"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents an approximate method for modeling of the WCDMA interface in the UMTS network in which the mobile operator introduces priorities and user differentiation.

The proposed scheme is applicable for cost-effective WCDMA resource management in 3G mobile networks and can be easily applied to network capacity calculations.","doi":"10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158654","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089941/5158601/05158654.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WCDMA interface in UMTS network carrying a mixture of multi-rate traffic with different priorities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158654/","displayDocTitle":"WCDMA interface in UMTS network carrying a mixture of multi-rate traffic with different priorities","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158654/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WCDMA interface in UMTS network carrying a mixture of multi-rate traffic with different priorities","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morroco","sourcePdf":"1569176547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081269S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089941","isNumber":"5158601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089941","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5158601","articleId":"5158654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158657,"authors":[{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["The State Key Lab. of ISN, Xidian University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Chungang Yang","affiliation":["The State Key Lab. of ISN, Xidian University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chungang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404777500"},{"name":"Weiying Li","affiliation":["The State Key Lab. of ISN, Xidian University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Weiying","lastName":"Li","id":"37577674100"},{"name":"Dong Chen","affiliation":["The State Key Lab. of ISN, Xidian University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37288964700"},{"name":"Dan Chen","affiliation":["The State Key Lab. of ISN, Xidian University Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37400197300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2936-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2937-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158657","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Power control","Cognitive radio","Iterative algorithms","Power system modeling","Signal to noise ratio","System performance","Nash equilibrium","Robustness","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Pareto optimisation","power control","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","noncooperative power control game","pricing","spectrum utilization","signal-to-interference","noise ratio","Pareto optimality","Nash equilibrium","iterative power allocation","punishment factor","constant factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Non-cooperative Power Control Game","Utility function","Nash Equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158657","doi":"10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158657","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","abstract":"Cognitive radio has been recently been proposed as a promising technology to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency by intelligently sensing and opportunely spectrum accessing some vacant bands of the primary users. In this paper, the power control problem in secondary system is modeled as a non-cooperative game model. To improve the secondary system's performance, a pricing function based on signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) is incorporated into the non-cooperative power control game model, which referred as NPCGP in this paper. The existence, uniqueness and Pareto optimality of Nash equilibrium (NE) for the proposed NPCGP model are proved. An iterative power allocation algorithm based on NPCGP mode is proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that the algorithm is robust and it converges rapidly. By setting appropriate parameters, our algorithm will converge to a NE after about 3~5 iterative operations which can satisfy the real-time requirement. The effect of the parameters (e.g. punishment factor, the constant factor c ) on the performance is discussed. It is shown that the network throughput with our algorithm is 1~4 times greater than the traditional algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158601","startPage":"270","endPage":"275","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089941/5158601/05158657.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pricing based power control game for Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158657/","displayDocTitle":"Pricing based power control game for Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750227","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pricing based power control game for Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morroco","sourcePdf":"1569176521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070655S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089941","isNumber":"5158601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089941","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5158601","articleId":"5158657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158659,"authors":[{"name":"Fahad Syed Muhammad","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Fahad Syed","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37397440500"},{"name":"Antoine Stephan","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Stephan","id":"37572031500"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Baudais","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Baudais","id":"37269847800"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Helard","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269844900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2936-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2937-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158659","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Bit error rate","Error analysis","OFDM modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Throughput","Peak to average power ratio","Interference","Bandwidth","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoded OFDM","bit rate maximization loading algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","mean bit error rate constraints","peak error rate constraint","power spectral density constraint","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"The bit loading algorithms are proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and linear pre- coded OFDM under power spectral density and mean bit error rate (BER) constraints.

A closed-form solution of this generalized eigenvalue problem using the MP method is solved by Rank Revealing QR factorization (RRQR). The RRQR reveals information about numerical rank and efficiently divides the space into signal and noise subspaces. Our algorithm is proficient to estimate CFO by not involving Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the spectral data matrix.

The system throughput is severely degraded by inter-cell interference (ICI), especially at cell edge. To satisfy the performance requirement, ICI must be mitigated effectively. Several schemes have been proposed to handle this problem by coordinating the way to allocate spectrum resource to each cell. Since the allocation of spectrum has effects on ICI mitigation and the spectral efficiency, a wise strategy to consider those two factors is required. In this paper, we propose a new scheme named as power division reuse partitioning scheme with successive interference cancellation (PDICS). PDICS balances ICI mitigation and spectral efficiency by appropriate frequency allocation and power distribution. To improve frequency efficiency, the frequency reuse factor is chosen as 0.5, so INCI exists. To minimize INCI, successive interference cancellation is suggested. The simulation results show that PDICS has better performance of throughput and symbol error rate (SER) than the conventional schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089941/5158601/05158678.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"381","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency reuse partitioning scheme with successive interference cancellation for OFDM downlink transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDM","Downlink","Throughput","Radio spectrum management","Resource management","Error analysis","Bandwidth","Frequency division multiplexing","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation","radio links","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency reuse partitioning scheme","successive interference cancellation","OFDM downlink transmission","multicell OFDMA systems","intercell interference","spectrum resource allocation","spectral efficiency","power division reuse partitioning scheme","appropriate frequency allocation","power distribution","symbol error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDMA","inter cell interference","inner cell interference","reuse partitioning scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A frequency reuse partitioning scheme with successive interference cancellation for OFDM downlink transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158678/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750240","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency reuse partitioning scheme with successive interference cancellation for OFDM downlink transmission","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morroco","sourcePdf":"1569177092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080611S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089941","isNumber":"5158601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089941","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5158601","articleId":"5158678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158679,"authors":[{"name":"LiMing Hou","affiliation":["Department of electronics and engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"LiMing Hou","id":"37573900900"},{"name":"Zengli Wang","affiliation":["The School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zengli Wang","id":"37577868400"},{"name":"Xiaokang Lin","affiliation":["Graduate school at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Xiaokang Lin","id":"37274732000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2936-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2937-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158679","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"An efficient partial feedback scheme is proposed for the subchannel allocation in the multiuser OFDM systems to minimize the system power consumption under the constraints of the overall target throughput and bit error rate. The conventional feedback schemes only send back the minor subchannels' information or compress the channel information to few bits. There is a large margin left corresponding to the full feedback scheme. In this paper, we propose a method to derive the channel state information (CSI) for the null feedback subchannels from the best-n and lowest-1 feedback information. For the flat fading Rayleigh channel, the pretreatment of the feedback CSI can provide the approximate full knowledge of the channel state. And then the power and subchannels are allocated to the users adaptively. The simulation results show that the pretreatment method greatly enhances the performance than the conventional best-n scheme, and comparing with the other pretreatment method, the proposed scheme provides an efficient and less complexity solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089941/5158601/05158679.pdf","startPage":"382","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTEL.2009.5158679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial CSI feedback scheme for subchannel allocation in multiuser OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Energy consumption","Rayleigh channels","State feedback","Throughput","Bit error rate","Channel state information","Resource management","Wireless networks","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","feedback","frequency division multiplexing","multiuser channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial CSI feedback","subchannel allocation","multiuser OFDM systems","system power consumption","target throughput","bit error rate","channel information","channel state information","null feedback subchannels","flat fading Rayleigh channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","subchannel allocation","best-n+lowest-1 feedback","CSI pretreament"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Partial CSI feedback scheme for subchannel allocation in multiuser OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158679/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10750241","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial CSI feedback scheme for subchannel allocation in multiuser OFDM systems","confLoc":"Marrakech, Morroco","sourcePdf":"1569176285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042865S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089941","isNumber":"5158601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089941","xplore-issue":"5158601","articleId":"5158679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5158718,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In the final phase of this operation a small amount of vitreous is replaced with a bubble of expansive gas or oil to push on recovering parts of the retina. Correct position of the head during recovery time is therefore important. The presented device provides periodical monitoring and logging the posture of the patient head. The patient is warned by sound alarm when his head position is incorrect. The digital three-axis MEMS accelerometer has been used for tilt sensing. Digital signal processing provided by microcontroller is used for noise reduction, tilt angle calculation and calibrating the sensor. Measured data are stored into flash memory. Data can be downloaded from the device using wireless communication interface. The developed computer software makes it possible to set up the device before treatment. It is also designed for measured data analyzing. The clinical specialist can assess the efficiency of the treatment. The described system helps the patient to keep a correct head posture. It is also a powerful diagnostic tool for clinical specialists. Therefore it will improve results of vitreoretinal surgery procedures.","doi":"10.1109/RADIOELEK.2009.5158718","publicationTitle":"2009 19th International Conference Radioelektronika","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 19th International Conference Radioelektronika","pdfPath":"/iel5/5153152/5158702/05158718.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADIOELEK.2009.5158718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software for automatic head position monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158718/","displayDocTitle":"Software for automatic head position monitoring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10778960","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158718/","conferenceDate":"22-23 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software for automatic head position monitoring","confLoc":"Bratislava, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"circuits_02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053585S","chronDate":"22-23 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5153152","isNumber":"5158702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5153152","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5158702","articleId":"5158718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5158719,"authors":[{"name":"Juraj Gazda","affiliation":["Slovakia"],"firstName":"Juraj","lastName":"Gazda","id":"37391894100"},{"name":"Peter Drotar","affiliation":["Slovakia"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Drotar","id":"37391896800"},{"name":"Dusan Kocur","affiliation":["Slovakia"],"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Kocur","id":"37282283900"},{"name":"Pavol Galajda","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Multimedia Communications, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Technical University of Ko\u0161ice, Kosice, Slovakia"],"firstName":"Pavol","lastName":"Galajda","id":"37391896300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3537-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3538-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5158719","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","System performance","High power amplifiers","Transmitters","Fading","Gold","Detectors","Power system modeling","Frequency conversion","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","Golay codes","multiuser detection","power amplifiers","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-CDMA transmission system performance","nonlinear high power amplifier","frequency selective fading channel","correct joint selection","spreading codes","uplink multi-carrier code division multiple access transmission system model","Walsh code","orthogonal Gold code","Golay code","Zadoff-Chu code","minimum mean-square error receiver","microstatistic multi-user receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","HPA","Ghorbani model","PAPR","multi-user receivers"]}],"abstract":"The study in this paper underlines the importance of correct joint selection of the spreading codes at the transmitter side and detector at the receiver side in the uplink multi-carrier code division multiple access transmission system model (MC-CDMA) in the presence of frequency selective fading environment and nonlinear distortion due to high power amplifier (HPA).

The input-output relationship of our model is equivalent to the Rakhmatov-Vrudhula-Wallach (RVW) model that has been verified by high fidelity simulations and experiments. The major improvement of our model is that it allows online prediction of battery life. This improvement is significant since for cyber-physical systems, control laws and online scheduling algorithms draw current from batteries according to the state of the plant and the processor, which cannot be determined at the design stage. Using our model, the optimal discharge profile for a square wave current are determined and simulation results are provided to compare battery life for different discharge profiles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5158833/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10762456","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Battery Model for Co-design in Cyber-Physical Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Battery Model for Co-design in Cyber-Physical Systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3660a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063399S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158800","isNumber":"5158801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158800","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5158801","articleId":"5158833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5158835,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279467200"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37276957800"},{"name":"Xue Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292951400"},{"name":"Wenbo He","affiliation":["Computer Science, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"He","id":"37288549600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3660-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-0678"}],"articleNumber":"5158835","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":768},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Internet","Resource management","Energy consumption","Cloud computing","Network servers","Cooling","Costs","Energy efficiency","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval systems","Internet","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet data centers","elastic power management","energy consuming facilities","cloud computing platforms","Internet services","resource managements"]}],"abstract":"Data Centers are energy consuming facilities that host Internet services such as cloud computing platforms.

We give some future research directions and the potential solutions to jointly optimize computing and environmental resources in data centers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Challenges Towards Elastic Power Management in Internet Data Centers","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2009.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158800/5158801/05158835.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Challenges Towards Elastic Power Management in Internet Data Centers","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158835/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750713","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Challenges Towards Elastic Power Management in Internet Data Centers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3660a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059755S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158800","isNumber":"5158801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158800","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5158801","articleId":"5158835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5158859,"authors":[{"name":"John McGlone","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McGlone","id":"37573088900"},{"name":"Alan Marshall","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Marshall","id":"37278176400"},{"name":"Roger Woods","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Woods","id":"37271861100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3660-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-0678"}],"articleNumber":"5158859","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"abstract":"This paper introduces an adaptive packet sampling mechanism for IP flow monitors that are incorporated into network elements. Such monitors have limited resources that can be rapidly exhausted by network attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and port scanning. The mechanism provides resilience against these types of network attacks by adapting its packet sampling rate according to the available resources in the monitor, and on the flow statistics. Results are presented that show how the sampling mechanism is able to constrain the number of flow entries to available memory resources and how it meets a key criterion of IP flow monitoring systems under duress, whereby the monitoring performance degrades gracefully during attack periods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Monitoring","Telecommunication traffic","Field programmable gate arrays","Statistics","Video on demand","Bandwidth","Communication system traffic control","Distributed computing","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","sampling methods","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attack-resilent sampling mechanism","IP flow monitoring system","adaptive packet sampling mechanism","distributed denial-of-service","port scanning","flow statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP flow monitoring","adaptive packet sampling","DoS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDCSW.2009.28","publicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158800/5158801/05158859.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSW.2009.28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Attack-Resilent Sampling Mechanism for Integrated IP Flow Monitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5158859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Attack-Resilent Sampling Mechanism for Integrated IP Flow Monitors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5158859/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5158859/","accessionNumber":"10762477","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Attack-Resilent Sampling Mechanism for Integrated IP Flow Monitors","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"3660a233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057708S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158800","isNumber":"5158801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158800","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5158801","articleId":"5158859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5158957,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Wang","affiliation":["Electro-Inf.

It is significant in increasing the capacity of the system and the efficiency of the frequency spectrum. The traditional channel estimation algorithms have the disadvantages of performance worsening and they are all hard to obtain good performance in the transmission efficiency and operational precision, so a new method based on insertion pilot method and regression least square support vector machine (RLS-SVM) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the frequency responses of the positions of pilot frequencies and the frequency responses between the carriers are obtained, then the frequency responses of the positions of the subsequent subcarriers are predicted by applying RLS-SVM algorithm. The simulation result shows that increasing with SNR, performance of this method is better than all the traditional methods when applied to OFDM system. At the same transmission rate, the number of pilot frequencies in RLS-SVM algorithm is less than that in traditional algorithms, so the transmission efficiency of the system is improved. In a word, the performance of RLS-SVM is far and away better than that of traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/JCAI.2009.173","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/5158913/5158914/05159117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCAI.2009.173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5158914","startPage":"773","endPage":"776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on Channel Estimation Technology in OFDM System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study on Channel Estimation Technology in OFDM System","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159117/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10762722","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on Channel Estimation Technology in OFDM System","confLoc":"Hainan, China","sourcePdf":"3615a773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063184S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5158913","isNumber":"5158914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5158913","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5158914","articleId":"5159117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5159168,"authors":[{"name":"Shannon Steinfadt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent University, Kent, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Shannon","lastName":"Steinfadt","id":"37569873300"},{"name":"Kevin Schaffer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kent University, Kent, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Schaffer","id":"37569873400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3685-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5159168","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159168","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Sequences","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Field programmable gate arrays","Bioinformatics","Parallel algorithms","Graphics","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SWAMP sequence alignment","local sequence alignment algorithm","Smith-Waterman style","associative computing","parallel algorithm","hardware architecture","ASC model realization","ClearSpeed CSX processor","NVIDIA","GPGPU graphics processor","IBM cell processor","FPGA","bioinformatics sequence alignment","SWAMP+"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sequence alignment","parallel computing","associative SIMD","GPGPUs","Cell Processor","FPGAs"]}],"abstract":"This document is a summary and overview of several approaches to implement the local sequence alignment algorithms known as SWAMP and SWAMP+ on commercially available hardware.

The authors see a parallel between the state of the data centers today and the evolution of the Intelligent Network (IN) infrastructure in telecommunication. The telecommunications networks have for many years, demonstrated their ability to reliably enable network (voice) services creation, assurance and delivery on a massive scale. Based on an analysis of the Intelligent Networks in telecommunications to identify proven concepts and key lessons that can be applied to enable next generation IT datacenters experience this paper asserts that: (1) In order to scale cloud services reliably to millions of service developers and billions of end users the next generation cloud computing and datacenter infrastructure will have to follow an evolution similar to the one that led to the creation of scalable telecommunication networks. (2) In the future network-based cloud service providers will leverage virtualization technologies to be able to allocate just the right levels of virtualized compute, network and storage resources to individual applications based on real-time business demand while also providing full service level assurance of availability, performance and security at a reasonable cost. (3) A key component - identified in this paper as the Virtual Resource Mediation Layer (VRML), must be developed through industry collaboration to enable interoperability of various public and private clouds. This layer will form the basis for ensuring massive scalability of cloud infrastructure by enabling distributed service creation, service delivery and service assurance without any single vendor domination. (4) The next generation virtualization technologies must allow applications to dynamically access CPU, memory, bandwidth and storage (capacity, I/O and throughput) in a manner similar to that of the telecommunications 800 Service Call Model with one level of indirection and mediation. The authors believe that the next generation cloud evolution is a fundamental transformation - and not just an evolutionary stack of XaaS implementations, which will enable global service collaboration networks utilizing optimally distributed and managed computing, network and storage resources driven in real-time by business priorities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing and the Lessons from the Past","publicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2009.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159182/5159183/05159214.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing and the Lessons from the Past","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159214/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10762798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing and the Lessons from the Past","confLoc":"Groningen, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3683a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042434S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159182","isNumber":"5159183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159182","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5159183","articleId":"5159214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5159218,"authors":[{"name":"Borje Ohlman","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["B\u00f6rje Ohlman is a Senior Research Engineer at Ericsson he received his M.Sc. degree in Computer Science and History of Ideas and Sciences from Uppsala University, Sweden.

Today, such infrastructures are normally provided in large data centres and the applications are executed remotely from the users. One reason for this is that cloud computing requires a reasonably stable infrastructure and networking environment, largely due to management reasons. Networking of Information (NetInf) is an information centric networking paradigm that can support cloud computing by providing new possibilities for network transport and storage. It offers direct access to information objects through a simple API, independent of their location in the network. This abstraction can hide much of the complexity of storage and network transport systems that cloud computing today has to deal with. In this paper we analyze how cloud computing and NetInf can be combined to make cloud computing infrastructures easier to manage, and potentially enable deployment in smaller and more dynamic networking environments. NetInf should thus be understood as an enhancement to the infrastructure for cloud computing rather than a change to cloud computing technology as such. To illustrate the approach taken by NetInf, we also describe how it can be implemented by introducing a specific name resolution and routing mechanism.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Networking of Information Can Do for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2009.27","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159182/5159183/05159218.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2009.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"What Networking of Information Can Do for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159218/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10750735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Networking of Information Can Do for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Groningen, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3683a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042587S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159182","isNumber":"5159183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159182","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5159183","articleId":"5159218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5159239,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Tusa","affiliation":["Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria Contrada di Dio, S.

The use of Grid technology, in fact, allows business companies to achieve an higher productivity, to decrease maintenance costs and to adapt to market demands with an increased customer satisfaction. To meet these challenges, Grid computing needs to address several issues in term of Quality of Service, Service accountability and Security.Our work, built on Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), provides new capabilities (i.e. a strong security data storage) to be used on top of different Grid middlewares. The solution is specifically implemented on gLite and accomplishes the access to data storage Grid resources in a uniform and transparent way. The proposed approach is based on XML data encapsulation to store encrypted data and metadata as well as data owners, X509v3 certificates, AES keys, data size, and file format.","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2009.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2009.31","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th IEEE International Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises","pdfPath":"/iel5/5159182/5159183/05159239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an XML-Based Grid File Storage System with Security Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159239/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an XML-Based Grid File Storage System with Security Features","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10750748","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159239/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an XML-Based Grid File Storage System with Security Features","confLoc":"Groningen, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"3683a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107194S","chronDate":"June 29 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5159182","isNumber":"5159183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5159182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5159183","articleId":"5159239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5159242,"authors":[{"name":"Emilio P.

Contemporary fast intersection algorithms, which use SIMD instructions, focus on the intersection of ray packets against triangles. For intersection between single rays and triangles, operations such as horizontal addition or dot product are required. The SSE4 instruction set adds the dot product instruction which can be used for this purpose. This paper presents a new modification of the fast ray-triangle intersection algorithms commonly used, which-when implemented on SSE4-outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms. It also allows both a single ray and ray packet intersection calculation with the same precomputed data.

The proposed methodology examines the interdependency of electricity and natural gas in a highly complex transmission system. The natural gas transmission system is modeled as a set of nonlinear equations. The proposed solution applies a decomposition method to separate the natural gas transmission feasibility check subproblem and the power transmission feasibility check subproblem from the hourly unit commitment (UC) in the master problem. Gas contracts are modeled and incorporated in the master UC problem. The natural gas transmission subproblem checks the feasibility of natural gas transmission as well as natural gas transmission security constraints for the commitment and dispatch of gas-fired generating units. If any natural gas transmission violations arise, corresponding energy constraints will be formed and added to the master problem for solving the next iteration of UC. The iterative process will continue until a converged feasible gas transmission solution is found. A six-bus power system with seven-node gas transmission system and the IEEE 118-bus power system with 14-node gas transmission system are analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility or the ISO for the short-term commitment and dispatch of generating units with natural gas transmission constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2023262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5170200/05159358.pdf","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2023262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security-Constrained Unit Commitment With Natural Gas Transmission Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159358/","displayDocTitle":"Security-Constrained Unit Commitment With Natural Gas Transmission Constraints","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793380","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159358/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security-Constrained Unit Commitment With Natural Gas Transmission Constraints","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs03-mshahidehpour-2023262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181912S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5170200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"265","xplore-issue":"5170200","articleId":"5159358","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5159360,"authors":[{"name":"Fangyue Chen","affiliation":["School of Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5191259/5159360/5159360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fangyue Chen received the graduate courses diploma in applied mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree in operations research and control theory from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.","Currently, he is Full Professor at the School of Science, Hangzhou Dianzi Uniersity, Zhejiang, China.

The inspection policy, which includes the sequence in which sensors are applied and the threshold levels used at the inspection stations, affects the probability of misclassifying a container as well as the cost and time spent in inspection. This work is an extension of a paper by Elsayed et al., which considers an inspection system operating with a Boolean decision function combining station results. In this paper, we present a multiobjective optimization approach to determine the optimal sensor arrangement and threshold levels, while considering cost and time. The total cost includes cost incurred by misclassification errors and the total expected cost of inspection, while the time represents the total expected time a container spends in the inspection system. Examples which apply the approach in various systems are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2009.2022172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5443442/05159365.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2009.2022172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Port-of-Entry Inspection Policy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Port-of-Entry Inspection Policy","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159365/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208216","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of a Port-of-Entry Inspection Policy","sourcePdf":"tase-eelsayed-2022172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112398S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5443442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5443442","articleId":"5159365","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159367,"authors":[{"name":"Shiva Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Shiva Kumar (M'03) received the B.E. degree in electronics and communications from Mysore University, India, in 1988, the M.S. degree in 1990, the Ph.D. degree in 1994 in electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and the Ph.D. degree in 1997 in communications engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Jena, Germany, supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from 1997\u20131998.

The amplifier noise excites higher order Gauss-Hermite noise modes and the nonlinear mixing of a signal pulse and higher order Gauss-Hermite noise mode leads to new noise fields which enhance the nonlinear phase noise. The higher order noise modes propagate linearly and enhance the linear phase noise if the matched filter is not used at the receiver.

Taking advantage of an ensemble approach, multiple type-1 fuzzy filters are combined to reach a decision. The fuzzy logic concept for linguistic variables and possibility theory is discussed with regard to knowledge representation and inference procedures. To improve conventional deinterlacing issues, we adopt type-1 fuzzy set concepts to design a weight-measuring approach. We demonstrate that the fuzzy ensemble approach model is well suited to image processing and provide case studies in the video-deinterlacing field. In our proposed method, five fuzzy membership functions (MFs) of linguistic variable-based fuzzy logic filters are derived from the type-1 (a.k.a. ordinary or primary) fuzzy MF. The weight-measuring process of our proposed model is used to assign weights to six candidate deinterlaced pixels (CDPs) that are interpolated according to edge direction. The use of a different MF for each direction allows the filter to characterize each pixel variation influence independently, according to its direction. The weights from all MFs are multiplied with the CDPs. The results of the empirical trials clearly show that the proposed system can successfully deal with several image types containing motion or detail elements.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2026638","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5338640/05159369.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2026638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concept of Linguistic Variable-Based Fuzzy Ensemble Approach: Application to Interlaced HDTV Sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Concept of Linguistic Variable-Based Fuzzy Ensemble Approach: Application to Interlaced HDTV Sequences","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11000135","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159369/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept of Linguistic Variable-Based Fuzzy Ensemble Approach: Application to Interlaced HDTV Sequences","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-jeon-2026638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093735S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5338640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5338640","articleId":"5159369","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5159376,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Kedzierski","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5185350/5159376/5159376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jakub Kedzierski received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001.","After his graduation, he was with the IBM T.

Another contribution of this paper is to estimate the rotor speed and position. For low-speed estimation, we have to eliminate the current and voltage sensors' dc offsets, detect the stator resistance, and take into account the voltage drop of the inverter power switches. We solve these problems by using a simple technique for eliminating the voltage sensors and a simple method for online estimation of the stator resistance and modeling the voltage drop of the inverter power switches. It is worthwhile to mention that the current sensors' dc offsets, seen on the measured currents, are negligible. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2026379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026379","startPage":"375","endPage":"384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05159380.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Input\u2013Output Feedback-Linearization-Based Torque Control of Synchronous Reluctance Motor Without Mechanical Sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Input\u2013Output Feedback-Linearization-Based Torque Control of Synchronous Reluctance Motor Without Mechanical Sensor","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","volume":"57","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159380/","accessionNumber":"11019824","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159380/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Input\u2013Output Feedback-Linearization-Based Torque Control of Synchronous Reluctance Motor Without Mechanical Sensor","sourcePdf":"tie-abootorabizarchi-2026379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065277S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5159380","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5159383,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5230335/5159383/5159383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Fu (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.","In the summer of 2007, he worked as an Intern at Synaptics and was involved in mixed-signal design and verification.

An algebraic identifier, which is known to be of unstable nature, is provided with an automatic disconnection strategy. The automatic disconnection is achieved by assessing an extra auxiliary parameter, called the ldquosentinelrdquo parameter that monitors the convergence of the rest of the estimated system parameters. The estimated values of mass, stiffness, and damping are realized via an algebraic estimator, with great rapidity and robustness to noise process signals present in the input and output signals. A generalized proportional integral controller was designed for a trajectory tracking task and the rejection of a constant disturbance input. The switched implementation of the average input in the form of a bounded discontinuous control signal is based on the use of a Sigma- Delta modulator. In an average sense, this modulation allows us to preserve the desirable features of the dynamic output feedback controller and to be close to a real implementation. The efficiency of the complete procedure is demonstrated via digital computer simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2026383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200775","startPage":"3665","endPage":"3674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5200775/05159385.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Identification and Discontinuous Control for Trajectory Tracking in a Perturbed 1-DOF Suspension System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159385/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Identification and Discontinuous Control for Trajectory Tracking in a Perturbed 1-DOF Suspension System","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816630","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Identification and Discontinuous Control for Trajectory Tracking in a Perturbed 1-DOF Suspension System","sourcePdf":"tie-cortesromero-2026383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152984S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5200775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5200775","articleId":"5159385","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5159389,"authors":[{"name":"Malek Ghanes","affiliation":["Equipe Commande des Syst\u00e8mes, Ecole Nationale Superieure d''Electronique et de ses Applications, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/5159389/5159389-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Malek Ghanes received the Dip.Ing. degree from University of M.

We define an optimization problem that corresponds to the minimization of both the power consumption and video distortion of a video encoder. A joint rate-complexity-distortion(R-C-D) model is developed to capture and control the general R-C-D behavior of video coding. Based on the analysis of the proposed model, optimization strategies are developed to achieve good video quality while maximizing the battery service life. We demonstrate how the observations and optimization strategies can be utilized in a practical parameterized encoder under various preferences of quality and power. We perform simulations on an instruction set simulator to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10917718","htmlLink":"/document/5159405/","displayDocTitle":"Power and Distortion Optimization for Pervasive Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Distortion Optimization for Pervasive Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-iahmad-2026810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10263S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5280597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5280597","articleId":"5159405","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5159417,"authors":[{"name":"Qi-Feng Liu","affiliation":["Center of Microwave and RF Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5191308/5159417/5159417-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi-Feng Liu was born in Anhui province, China, in 1981.

However, the computational complexity and large amount of data access make real-time processing of stereo vision challenging because of the inherent instruction cycle delay within conventional computers.

This paper proposes a fully pipelined stereo vision system providing a dense disparity image with additional sub-pixel accuracy in real-time. The entire stereo vision process, such as rectification, stereo matching, and post-processing, is realized using a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) without the necessity of any external devices.

Video compression is computationally intensive and energy-demanding. Therefore, one critical issue in portable video communication system design is to minimize the energy consumption of video encoding so as to prolong the operational lifetime of portable video devices. In this paper, we explore advanced methods in adaptive system control and develop an online complexity control and energy minimization scheme for real-time video encoding. More specifically, we introduce a set of parameters to control the computational complexity and energy consumption of the video encoder. We consider this video encoder as a nonlinear control system. Based on adaptive critic design, an advanced adaptive control method recently developed in control science, we design an online control scheme which is able to select the best configuration of complexity control parameters to minimize the energy consumption under rate-distortion constraints, or equivalently maximize video quality under rate and energy constraints. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme approaches the true optimum performance. The proposed online complexity control and energy minimization scheme will provide an important tool for energy minimization of portable video devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2026835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5373981/05159428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2026835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5373981","startPage":"27","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Critic Design for Energy Minimization of Portable Video Communication Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Critic Design for Energy Minimization of Portable Video Communication Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11084031","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5159428/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Critic Design for Energy Minimization of Portable Video Communication Devices","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhe-2026835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0849S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5373981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5373981","articleId":"5159428","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159436,"authors":[{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5314168/5159436/5159436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengxiang Yang (M'00) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in automatic control and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1993, 1996, and 1999, respectively.","From October 1999 to October 2000, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Algorithm Design Group, Department of Computer Science, King's College London, London, U.K. He is currently a Lecturer with the Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, U.K. He is the author or coauthor of more than 90 publications.

Therefore, the SP routing problem in MANETs turns out to be a dynamic optimization problem. In this paper, we propose to use GAs with immigrants and memory schemes to solve the dynamic SP routing problem in MANETs. We consider MANETs as target systems because they represent new-generation wireless networks. The experimental results show that these immigrants and memory-based GAs can quickly adapt to environmental changes (i.e., the network topology changes) and produce high-quality solutions after each change.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10959199","htmlLink":"/document/5159436/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms With Immigrants and Memory Schemes for Dynamic Shortest Path Routing Problems in Mobile <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms With Immigrants and Memory Schemes for Dynamic Shortest Path Routing Problems in Mobile <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-yang-2023676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079036S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5314168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5314168","articleId":"5159436","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159445,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5204506/5159445/5159445-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Xiao (S'09) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering in 2000 from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 from Tsinghua University, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University, NJ, in 2009.","From 2003 and 2004, she was with North Carolina State University, N.C.

We propose an enhanced physical-layer authentication scheme to detect Sybil attacks, exploiting the spatial variability of radio channels in environments with rich scattering, as is typical in indoor and urban environments. We build a hypothesis test to detect Sybil clients for both wideband and narrowband wireless systems, such as WiFi and WiMax systems. Based on the existing channel estimation mechanisms, our method can be easily implemented with low overhead, either independently or combined with other physical-layer security methods, e.g., \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">spoofing</i>\n attack detection. The performance of our Sybil detector is verified, via both a propagation modeling software and field measurements using a vector network analyzer, for typical indoor environments. Our evaluation examines numerous combinations of system parameters, including bandwidth, signal power, number of channel estimates, number of total clients, number of Sybil clients, and number of access points. For instance, both the false alarm rate and the miss rate of Sybil attacks are usually below 0.01, with three tones, pilot power of 10 mW, and a system bandwidth of 20 MHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5204506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5204506/05159445.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"503","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Based Detection of Sybil Attacks in Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel-Based Detection of Sybil Attacks in Wireless Networks","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5159445/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828726","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Based Detection of Sybil Attacks in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"04tifs03-lxiao-2026454.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070185S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5204506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5204506","articleId":"5159445","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5159447,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiu-Cheng Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5344167/5159447/5159447-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiu-Cheng Chang was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1981.

Fundamental studies on blanket wafers and the device characteristics of product wafers showed positive results. These proved that MLFA has good potential for DRAM application. The periphery NMOS off current was reduced by 36%. This off-current improvement reduced the standby current by 5% in a DRAM functional test. The GIDL reductions for an NMOS array and periphery N- and PMOSs were 14.5%, 15%, and 39%, respectively. A model for GIDL improvement by MFLA application to DRAM production was proposed. It is believed that the main GIDL-impacted factor was the high electric field caused by defect-assisted tunneling and junction profile abruptness under the gate edge. Bright field and weak-beam dark-field TEM images showed perfect dislocation loops and fault dislocation loops staying in the {113} plane with a size of around 17 x 20 nm in the junction area.

Key characteristics of the antennas are found through electromagnetic simulation and physical measurements.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2009.2026663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/05159465.pdf","startPage":"767","endPage":"770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2009.2026663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Compact 6-Port Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159465/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Compact 6-Port Antenna","volume":"8","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"10812273","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159465/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Compact 6-Port Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-chiu-2026663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042944S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4808186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4808186","articleId":"5159465","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159471,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Tang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37416991000"},{"name":"Honglin Hu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Research Centre for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Honglin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37292019200"},{"name":"Hsiao-Hwa Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Hwa","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281172400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5159471","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Frequency division multiplexing","Lagrangian functions","Closed-form solution","Turbo codes","Constraint optimization","Frequency-selective fading channels","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","encoding","multiplexing","OFDM modulation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet-access OFDM system","wireless application","packet-access orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","Lagrange multiplier power-loading algorithm","power-loading optimization problem","adaptive modulation","channel inversion power-loading scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lagrange multiplier","modulation and coding","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","power loading","throughput"]}],"abstract":"Numerous power-loading techniques for wireless applications have been proposed in the literature. However, most of the existing power-loading schemes may not always be suitable for packet-access orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this paper, we propose a Lagrange multiplier power-loading (LMPL) algorithm for packet-access OFDM systems with fixed modulation and coding transmission. The proposed LMPL algorithm offers a closed-form solution for the power-loading optimization problem under a total transmit power constraint. As a closed-form solution may not be available for adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) transmission, we use a low-complexity joint LMPL algorithm to enhance the system throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed LMPL algorithms outperform the traditional channel inversion power-loading (CIPL) scheme. It is also shown that the theoretically derived throughput very well matches the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2026757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05159471.pdf","startPage":"5324","endPage":"5330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2026757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Power-Loading Algorithms for Packet-Access OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159471/","displayDocTitle":"On Power-Loading Algorithms for Packet-Access OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966618","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159471/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Power-Loading Algorithms for Packet-Access OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2026757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055146S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5159471","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159472,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["School Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5383378/5159472/5159472-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christos Masouros (M'06) received the Diploma degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree by research and Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Microwave and Communication Systems Group, School Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester.

The utilization of part of the interference is achieved by selectively orthogonalizing the desired symbols to destructive interference by means of precoding while allowing interference that constructively contributes to the useful signal's energy. The existence and exploitation of constructive interference effectively spreads the signal constellation and enhances the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver. SINR improvement is attained with no need for additional power-per-user investment at the transmitter since energy that is inherent in the CDMA system is utilized. The scheme introduced in this paper applies to the downlink of cellular phase-shift keying (PSK)-based CDMA systems. Theoretical analysis and comparative simulations show that significant performance improvement can be attained with the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2026906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05159472.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2026906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Linear Precoding for the Downlink of DS/CDMA Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Soft Linear Precoding for the Downlink of DS/CDMA Communication Systems","volume":"59","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11070298","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159472/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159472/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Linear Precoding for the Downlink of DS/CDMA Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-masouros-2026906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09625S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5159472","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5159476,"authors":[{"name":"Arnau Cabedo","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Department, Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5230340/5159476/5159476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arnau Cabedo was born in Barcelona, Spain.

Cross-polarized antenna systems resolve this problem by using perpendicular antennas. Correlation is reduced while keeping antennas co-located. Inter-antenna correlation and cross-polar discrimination(XPD) are two fundamental parameters of these polarized antenna systems. This paper proposes an analytical channel model, from which closed-form solutions for the correlation coefficient and the XPD are deduced. The environment is supposed to have a truncated Laplacian power azimuth spectrum that is widely used in standardization bodies. The receiving di- or tri-pole antenna can have random orientation. The correlation and the XPD show to be highly sensitive to receiver orientation, azimuth spread and environment depolarization behavior. Measurements have been conducted at 3.5 GHz to validate the solution obtained. Good agreement is achieved when comparing theoretical curves and experimental results for different receiver orientations, both for the correlation coefficient and the XPD.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5230340/05159478.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230340","startPage":"2739","endPage":"2745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipolarized MIMO Channel Characteristics: Analytical Study and Experimental Results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multipolarized MIMO Channel Characteristics: Analytical Study and Experimental Results","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847288","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159478/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipolarized MIMO Channel Characteristics: Analytical Study and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"57tap09-fquitin-2027041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069925S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5230340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5230340","articleId":"5159478","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159481,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad J.

By phase shifting each element correctly, the desired amplitude and phase of each symbol in a digital modulation scheme can be produced in a given direction with data rates determined by the switching speed of the phase shifters. Because this signal is direction-dependent, the technique offers security, as the signal can be purposely distorted in other directions. DM also enables an array to send independent data in multiple directions. When using an array with driven elements, the phase shifts can be determined from simple calculations rather than time-consuming simulations or measurements.

As a consequence, compression performance is notably improved with respect to the Recommendation for a large variety of remote sensing images, both monoband and multi-/hyper-/ultraspectral images.

In preparation for the SMAP mission, an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) and field experimental campaigns using the Passive and Active L- and S-band Airborne Sensor (PALS) have been conducted. We use the PALS airborne observations and OSSE data to test the algorithm and develop an error budget table. When applied to four-month OSSE data, the change detection method is shown to perform better than direct inversion of the radiometer brightness temperatures alone, improving the root mean square error by 2% volumetric soil moisture content. The main assumptions of the algorithm are verified using PALS data from the soil moisture experiments held during June-July 2002 (Soil Moisture Experiment 2002) in Iowa.

Finally, we predicted the effects of LFN in sub-70-nm NAND flash memories.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5170230/05159497.pdf","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The - Noise and Random Telegraph Noise Characteristics in Floating-Gate <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2022700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2022700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"The <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{1}/f$</tex></formula> Noise and Random Telegraph Noise Characteristics in Floating-Gate <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10791370","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5159497/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\hbox{1}/f$</tex></formula> Noise and Random Telegraph Noise Characteristics in Floating-Gate <emphasis emphasistype=\"smcaps\">nand</emphasis> Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"ted-lee-2022700.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096466S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5170230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5159497","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159503,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Garzelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Siena, Sienna, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Garzelli","id":"37272262300"},{"name":"Filippo Nencini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Siena, Sienna, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Nencini","id":"37272257900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5159503","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":705},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality assessment","Hyperspectral imaging","Image quality","Distortion measurement","Testing","Data mining","Switches","Hyperspectral sensors","Computational modeling","Infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multispectral images","hyperspectral images","universal image quality index","monochrome images","hypercomplex number","hypercomplex correlation coefficient","spaceborne imagery","airborne imagery","interband distortion","intraband distortion","anomalous pixel values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hypercomplex correlation coefficient (CC)","hypercomplex number","image quality assessment","spectral distortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159503","abstract":"This letter presents a novel image quality index which extends the Universal Image Quality Index for monochrome images to multispectral and hyperspectral images through hypercomplex numbers.

In addition to reduced radiation efficiency by smaller antennas in smaller phones, the head and in particular the hand may further impair radiation performance. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the various parameters of the hand upon the OTA performance criteria to support the standardization process of the hand phantom and to provide the tools for optimization of handheld transmitters. The results reveal the following order of significance for small variations in hand parameters: 1) position of index finger; 2) distance between phone case and palm; 3) position of the other fingers; 4) size of the hand; 5) dielectric parameters; 6) wrist length and tilt. Some configurations may lead to a slight increase of the peak spatial SAR in the head. OTA assessment without the hand does not provide a good measure of phone performance in real life. However, good reproducibility of evaluations requires a precise definition of the hand, in particular its geometry and the phone position within the hand.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5230340/05159505.pdf","startPage":"2763","endPage":"2770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2027081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2027081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Hand Phantom on Mobile Phone Antenna Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging phantoms","Mobile handsets","Mobile antennas","Fingers","Standardization","Transmitters","Wrist","Dielectric measurements","Reproducibility of results","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","phantoms","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand phantom effect","mobile phone antenna performance","over-the-air radiation performance","standardization process","handheld transmitter optimization","spatial SAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna design","computer aided analysis","computer aided engineering","FDTD methods","hand phantom","mobile communication","mobile device antennas","numerical simulation","optimization","over-the-air (OTA) performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Hand Phantom on Mobile Phone Antenna Performance","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5159505/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847320","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Hand Phantom on Mobile Phone Antenna Performance","sourcePdf":"57tap09-cli-2027081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081487S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5230340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5230340","articleId":"5159505","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5159506,"authors":[{"name":"Yongcan Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5431005/5159506/5159506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongcan Cao (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.

A general fractional-order coordination model is introduced by summarizing three different cases: 1) fractional-order agent dynamics with integer-order coordination algorithms; 2) fractional-order agent dynamics with fractional-order coordination algorithms; and 3) integer-order agent dynamics with fractional-order coordination algorithms. We show sufficient conditions on the interaction graph and the fractional order such that coordination can be achieved using the general model. The coordination equilibrium is also explicitly given. In addition, we characterize the relationship between the number of agents and the fractional order to ensure coordination. Furthermore, we compare the convergence speed of coordination for fractional-order systems with that for integer-order systems. It is shown that the convergence speed of the fractional-order coordination algorithms can be improved by varying the fractional orders with time.

By means of 3-D TCAD simulations, the slope is shown to be the result of cell geometry, atomistic substrate doping, and random placement of traps over the cell active area. Finally, the slope dependence on cell geometry (width, length, and oxide thickness), doping, and bias conditions is summarized in a powerful formula that is able to predict the RTN instabilities in deca-nanometer Flash memories.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","volume":"56","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10791361","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159507/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive Analysis of Random Telegraph Noise Instability and Its Scaling in Deca\u2013Nanometer Flash Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Random Telegraph Noise Instability and Its Scaling in Deca\u2013Nanometer Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"ted-ghetti-2024031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080795S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5170230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5170230","articleId":"5159507","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5159518,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Kung","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Colombus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Christopher Kung (S'02\u2013M'09) received the B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 2009.","Since 2004, he has been a Graduate Research Associate with the Electroscience Lab at The Ohio State University.

After miniaturization, the vertical height of the antenna was reduced by over 60% while maintaining electrical performance. Prototype antennas were manufactured using low cost plastic injection molding and dipping processes to facilitate transition to mass production and to enhance the durability of the antenna. The simulated and measured reflection coefficient of the antenna show good agreement. Measured antenna gain patterns verify that the manufacturing process employed is capable of producing low loss antenna structures.

The technique is tailored herein to the case where the scatterer is a general slab and the technique is implemented with the FDTD method of the scattered field formulation. Since the technique relies on the use of a Maxwellian beam of dominant polarization as the excitation within the FDTD simulation, this paper presents also an improved scheme for synthesizing such a beam. Window averaging is also presented as a new scheme for mitigating the effects of aperture truncation. Validation of the technique revealed that the use of a non-Maxwellian Gaussian beam of uniform polarization produced erroneous values of the plane wave scattering coefficients. When used with a Maxwellian beam excitation, however, the technique showed to be trustworthy, stable and accurate, even for lossy media. Convergence test results revealed that the accuracy of the values of plane wave scattering coefficients decreased much faster as the conductivity of the medium increased than what would be expected from numerical anisotropy. Finally, poor accuracy results are reported when the scattered field illuminates strongly the edges or corners of the integration box around a finite-size slab.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2026919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5338646/05159525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2026919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338646","startPage":"3868","endPage":"3881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Numerical Technique for Computing the Values of Plane Wave Scattering Coefficients of a General Scatterer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Numerical Technique for Computing the Values of Plane Wave Scattering Coefficients of a General Scatterer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998787","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159525/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Numerical Technique for Computing the Values of Plane Wave Scattering Coefficients of a General Scatterer","sourcePdf":"tap-jroy-2026919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050153S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5338646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5338646","articleId":"5159525","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159527,"authors":[{"name":"Britton T.

The method numerically constructs the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator for the scenario subject to constraints on the radiated power and allowable level of supergain. The discussion also focuses on how the resulting radiation characteristics approximately optimize average capacity for multiple-input multiple-output communications. Computational results reveal that optimal antenna characteristics can provide significantly more diversity gain than that offered by the characteristics of a simple design. An example computation using genetic algorithm optimization demonstrates that a numerically optimized practical design can be designed whose performance is relatively close to that of the optimal array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Antenna Radiation Characteristics for Diversity and MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2026922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5308576/05159527.pdf","startPage":"3474","endPage":"3481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2026922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5308576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Antenna Radiation Characteristics for Diversity and MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5159527/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10958101","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Antenna Radiation Characteristics for Diversity and MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-mjensen-2026922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07285S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5308576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5308576","articleId":"5159527","onlineDate":"07 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159530,"authors":[{"name":"Min Choul Kim","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, College of Applied Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min Choul","lastName":"Kim","id":"38189371300"},{"name":"Sung Kim","affiliation":["Electronic Materials Engineering Department, Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183923600"},{"name":"Suk-Ho Choi","affiliation":["Department of Applied Physics, College of Applied Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suk-Ho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37310417800"},{"name":"K.

The structure employs only two microring resonators in order to implement the bar and cross states of the switch. These states are toggled using an optical pump at 1.5-mum wavelengths inplane with the waveguide devices, though electronic, rather than optical, control schemes are envisioned for more complex systems built from these devices. Experiments characterize bit-error-rate performance in the bar and cross states during static and dynamic operation. The all-optical demonstration exhibits the ability of the switch to implement ultra-short transition times (<2 ns), high extinction ratios (>10 dB), and low power penalties (~1 dB) at a data rate of 10 Gb/s. Further performance improvements are expected by using electronic carrier injection via p-i-n diodes surrounding the ring waveguides. The 2 times 2 switching functionality facilitates the design of more complex routing structures, allowing the implementation of high-functionality integrated optical networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed 2-2 Switch for Multiwavelength Silicon-Photonic Networks\u2013On-Chip","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2019256","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5153550/05159540.pdf","startPage":"2900","endPage":"2907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2019256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159540/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2009","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed 2<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\, \\times \\,$</tex></formula>2 Switch for Multiwavelength Silicon-Photonic Networks\u2013On-Chip","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"14","htmlLink":"/document/5159540/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"July15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10788069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed 2<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\, \\times \\,$</tex></formula>2 Switch for Multiwavelength Silicon-Photonic Networks\u2013On-Chip","sourcePdf":"jlt-blee-2019256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070475S","chronDate":"July15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5153550","articleId":"5159540","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159541,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Felipe Cardenas Lopez","affiliation":["Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Quito, Ecuador","Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5153550/5159541/5159541-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Felipe C\u00e1rdenas Lopez graduated in telecommunications engineering from the Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional, Ecuador, in 2003.

The focus is on the spatio-polar characterization of antennas, channels and their interactions. We provide closed form expressions for the covariance of the field multimodes as function of the power angle spectrum (PAS) and the channel cross-polarization ratio (XPR). A new interpretation of the mean effective gains (MEG) of antennas is also provided. The maximum MEG is obtained by conjugate mode matching between the antennas and the channel; we also prove the (intuitive) results that the optimum decorrelation of the antenna signals is obtained by the excitation of orthogonal spherical vector modes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical Vector Wave Expansion of Gaussian Electromagnetic Fields for Antenna-Channel Interaction Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2016686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/05159555.pdf","startPage":"2055","endPage":"2067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2016686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Spherical Vector Wave Expansion of Gaussian Electromagnetic Fields for Antenna-Channel Interaction Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5159555/","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774657","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical Vector Wave Expansion of Gaussian Electromagnetic Fields for Antenna-Channel Interaction Analysis","sourcePdf":"57tap05-aglazunov-2016686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107433S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"5159555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5159559,"authors":[{"name":"Dikshitulu K.

These class of problems exhibit multiple length/frequency scales and arise when analyzing scattering/radiation from realistic structures where dense discretization is necessary to accurately capture geometric features. Solutions to the discretized integral equations due to these structures is challenging, due to their high computational cost and ill-conditioning of the resulting matrix system. The focus of this paper is on ameliorating the computational cost. Our approach will rely on exploiting the recently developed accelerated Cartesian expansion (ACE) algorithm to arrive at a method that is stable and efficient at low frequencies. These will then be integrated with the well known fast multipole method, thus forming a scheme that is wideband. Rigorous convergence estimates of this method are derived, and convergence and efficiency of the overall fast method is demonstrated. These are then integrated into an existing integral equation solver, whose efficiency is demonstrated for some practical problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5159551/05159562.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2019926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2019926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Wideband FMM for Fast Integral Equation Solution of Multiscale Problems in Electromagnetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Integral equations","Frequency","Electromagnetic scattering","Costs","Acceleration","Computational efficiency","Convergence","Computational electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","convergence","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband FMM","integral equation solution","multiscale problems","electromagnetics","accelerated Cartesian expansion","multipole method","convergence","fast multipole method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerated Cartesian expansion (ACE)","Cartesian expansions","fast multipole method (FMM)","fast solvers","integral equation (IE)","multipole methods","multiscale","scattering","wideband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Wideband FMM for Fast Integral Equation Solution of Multiscale Problems in Electromagnetics","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5159562/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10774661","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Wideband FMM for Fast Integral Equation Solution of Multiscale Problems in Electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"57tap06-mvikram-2019926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066896S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5159551","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5159551","articleId":"5159562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5159604,"authors":[{"name":"Bradford Roberts","affiliation":["S&C Electric Company"],"bio":{"p":["Bradford Roberts is the power quality systems director for S&C Electric Company and chair of the Electricity Storage Association."]},"firstName":"Bradford","lastName":"Roberts","id":"37326403800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1540-7977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4216"}],"articleNumber":"5159604","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1855},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/pes/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Application software","Power systems","Batteries","Hybrid electric vehicles","Secure storage","Power grids","Renewable energy resources","Regulators","Power industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity supply industry","energy storage","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart electricity grid","renewable energy resources","electric power industry","energy storage","utility grids","plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","electric vehicles","electricity storage devices"]}],"abstract":"Making electricity grids \"smarter\" and modernizing them so that they can accept large amounts of renewable energy resources are fairly universally accepted as steps necessary to achieve a clean and secure electric power industry.

T-S fuzzy systems are used to approximate the unknown system uncertainties. Combining ldquodynamic surface control(DSC)rdquoapproach with ldquominimal learning parameters(MLP)rdquo algorithm, a systematic procedure for controller design is developed. The key features of the proposed scheme are that, firstly, the problem of ldquoexplosion of complexityrdquo inherent in the conventional backstepping method is circumvented, secondly, the number of parameters updated on line for each subsystem is reduced dramatically to 2, one for T-S fuzzy system and the other for the bound of disturbances, and, thirdly, the possible controller singularity problem in some of the existing adaptive control schemes with feedback linearization techniques is removed. These features result in a much simpler algorithm, which is easy to be implemented in application. It is shown that all the closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded(SGUUB) based on Lyapunov theory.

To improve the global vehicle dynamics, comfort and handling, coordination between traditionally stand-alone active systems is required. This demands for a global chassis controller. Thanks to the use of tyre force sensors, the controller proposed in this paper is structured on two layers which simplify the implementation and the computation. The top layer deals with the global control and the force allocation. Thanks to the structure, the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the tyre do not appear in this layer and the allocation can be treated as a convex optimization problem.

The PldrSPRldrD control is constructed by introducing a SPR (strict positive real) element instead of the I element in PID control. The purpose is to design a PldrSPRldrD controller for asymptotic stabilization and to adjust P, SPR, D parameter matrices for improving convergence speed of responses under guaranteeing the stability. In our method, we consider a certain hypothetical system derived from the closed-loop system with PldrSPRldrD control in order to apply high gain output feedback. Then the P, SPR, D parameter matrices are adjusted by making zero dynamics of the hypothetical system asymptotically stable and performing the high gain output feedback. The proposed method is fundamentally based on the high gain output feedback theorem. The PldrSPRldrD control is extended to PldrSPRldrDldrI control for improving steady state performance. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by simulation results for unstable MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5159855","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05159855.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5159855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","startPage":"4666","endPage":"4672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D and P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D\u22c5I control for linear multi-variable systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D and P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D\u22c5I control for linear multi-variable systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159855/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10775110","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159855/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D and P\u22c5SPR\u22c5D\u22c5I control for linear multi-variable systems \u2014Stabilization based on high gain output feedback\u2014","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145962S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5159855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5159889,"authors":[{"name":"Li Sheng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37532699500"},{"name":"Huizhong Yang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"firstName":"Huizhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5159889","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159889","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Stability analysis","Hopfield neural networks","Fuzzy control","Linear matrix inequalities","Neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Stability criteria","Delay effects","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","Hopfield neural nets","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","Newton method","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-dependent exponential stability analysis","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy delayed Hopfield neural network","fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach","time-varying delay","Leibniz-Newton formula","LMI","linear matrix inequality","free weighting matrix approach","numerical analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5159889","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05159889.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","startPage":"4296","endPage":"4301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5159889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-dependent exponential stability analysis of fuzzy delayed Hopfield neural networks: A fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach","abstract":"This paper investigates the delay-dependent exponential stability problem of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy Hopfield neural networks (HNNs) with time-varying delay.

The penalty on sensor induced positioning noise is minimal. For the Scanning Probe Microscope considered in this paper, the noise is marginally increased from 0.30 nm RMS to 0.39 nm RMS. Open- and closed-loop experimental images of a calibration standard are reported at speeds of 1 and 10 lines per second (with a scanner resonance frequency of 290 Hz). Compared to traditional integral or PID controllers, the proposed controller provides a bandwidth improvement of approximately ten times. This allows faster imaging and less tracking lag at low speeds.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Damping","Scanning probe microscopy","Bandwidth","Digital control","Operational amplifiers","Circuit noise","Calibration","Resonance","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","position control","robust control","scanning probe microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust damping","robust tracking controller","positioning stages","second-order controller","integral tracking action","scanning probe microscope","position sensors","digital controller","op-amp circuit","calibration standard"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5159934","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05159934.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5159934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new robust damping and tracking controller for SPM positioning stages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new robust damping and tracking controller for SPM positioning stages","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159934/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159934/","accessionNumber":"10775412","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new robust damping and tracking controller for SPM positioning stages","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094476S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5159934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council)","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5159948,"authors":[{"name":"Renato A.

Numerical examples illustrate the results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Lyapunov method","Control systems","Robustness","Time varying systems","Sampling methods","Filtering","Communication system control","Chaotic communication","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","filtering theory","Hinfin control","Lyapunov methods","minimisation","robust control","signal sampling","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hinfin filtering","networked control system","time-varying sampling rate","robust filter design","Finsler Lemma","optimization problem","path-dependent Lyapunov function","affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov function","minimisation","estimation error"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5159948","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05159948.pdf","startPage":"3372","endPage":"3377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5159948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> filtering of networked systems with time-varying sampling rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> filtering of networked systems with time-varying sampling rates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159948/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5159948/","accessionNumber":"10775459","conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H<inf>\u221e</inf> filtering of networked systems with time-varying sampling rates","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062756S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5159948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5159978,"authors":[{"name":"Yunjun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Materials and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Yunjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37403525700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4523-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4524-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"5159978","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5159978","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Stochastic processes","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Noise robustness","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Stochastic resonance","Uncertainty","Sensor systems","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","Fokker-Planck equation","integration","method of moments","minimisation","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","nonlinear programming","probability","remotely operated vehicles","robust control","statistical analysis","stochastic systems","tracking","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear robust stochastic control","unmanned aerial vehicle","dynamical system","uncertain system","environmental disturbance","sensor noise","state variable","statistical analysis","asymptotic stability","output tracking controller design","undetermined control parameter","closed-loop system","nonlinear programming","constrained optimization","minimization","Fokker-Planck equation","direct quadrature method-of-moment","probability density function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2009.5159978","publicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5089257/5159764/05159978.pdf","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2009.5159978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5159764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear robust stochastic control for unmanned aerial vehicles","abstract":"Almost all dynamical systems experience inherent uncertainties such as environmental disturbance and sensor noise. This paper describes a new robust stochastic control methodology, which is capable of controlling the statistical nature of state variables of a nonlinear system to designed (attainable) statistical properties. First, an asymptotically stable and robust output tracking controller is designed in which discontinuous functions are not involved. Second, undetermined control parameters in the closed-loop system are optimized through nonlinear programming. In this constrained optimization, the error between the desired and actual moments of state variables is minimized subject to constraints on statistical moments. As the key point to overcome the difficulties in solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation, a direct quadrature method of moments is proposed. The advantages of the proposed method are: (1) ability to control any specified stationary moments of the states or output probability density function; (2) no need for the state process to be a Gaussian; (3) robustness with respect to parametric and functional uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5159978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5159978/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10775405","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear robust stochastic control for unmanned aerial vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear robust stochastic control for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070829S","chronDate":"10-12 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5089257","isNumber":"5159764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5089257","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5159764","articleId":"5159978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AACC American Automatic Control Council","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
