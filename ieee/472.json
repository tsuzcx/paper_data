This paper addresses lessons learned from the creation and use of online homework generation modules in an electrical engineering signals and systems course. The nine modules address complex number calculations, complex conversions, signal graphing, zero input response, unit impulse response, Fourier series, and fast Fourier transforms. The primary goal was to create an innovative and engaging set of online learning experiences that would allow faculty to assess the transfer of mathematical knowledge from calculus and differential equations courses to subsequent electrical engineering courses. These modules offer student specific problem generation and automatic grading, where the latter accelerates the feedback cycle and provides tool scalability to large numbers of students. The tools are easily upgradable and offer the opportunity to track, through a database, elements of the student learning process that often go unrecorded but yield a rich data set for correlating performance on related subjects in current, previous, or subsequent semesters. The modules have been employed nine semesters to date, and student survey data from these experiences supplement data stored in the database files and data recorded from written examinations. Student reactions to these tools have been generally positive, where the ease of answer entry plays a large role in the experience. Quantitative correlations between module scores, grades on written examinations, and performance in previous mathematics courses have demonstrated variable clarity, but qualitative assessments of the technology-facilitated environment point to a clear increase in student learning and engagement. Instructor benefits are apparent with regard to grading time saved, grading consistency, confidence in student accountability for work submitted, and information regarding when/where students work that is difficult to obtain any other way.","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2008.4720500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2008.4720500","startPage":"T4B-17","endPage":"T4B-22","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4703377/4720249/04720500.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lessons learned from the application of online homework generation modules in a signals and systems course","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Lessons learned from the application of online homework generation modules in a signals and systems course","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720500/","accessionNumber":"10453829","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720500/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lessons learned from the application of online homework generation modules in a signals and systems course","confLoc":"Saratoga Springs, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132008-00251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070675S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4703377","isNumber":"4720249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4703377","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4720249","articleId":"4720500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4720536,"authors":[{"name":"James L.

This simplifies the development of remote labs by providing reusable components for common lab administration functions. The initial focus of the iLab project was on hatched labs, which require no interactive control. Following the projectpsilas success in supporting these labs, it has expanded its efforts to include those requiring interactive control. Interactive labs require that the user have active control of lab instruments during the course of an experiment and can generate a large amount of data. In order to accommodate these requirements, the iLab shared architecture has been extended with a highly configurable lab resource scheduling service, a robust data storage system and support for high bandwidth communication between the lab client and server. By integrating these services into the iLab shared architecture, a more diverse set of educationally valuable labs can now be easily deployed online and shared around the world.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720249","publicationTitle":"2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4703377/4720249/04720536.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2008.4720536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2008.4720536","startPage":"S2A-1","endPage":"S2A-6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deploying interactive remote labs using the iLab Shared Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720536/","displayDocTitle":"Deploying interactive remote labs using the iLab Shared Architecture","htmlLink":"/document/4720536/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10453863","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deploying interactive remote labs using the iLab Shared Architecture","confLoc":"Saratoga Springs, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12132008-00287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0762S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4703377","isNumber":"4720249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4703377","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4720249","articleId":"4720536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4720730,"authors":[{"name":"Ric Romero","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ric","lastName":"Romero","id":"37649091400"},{"name":"Nathan A.

Traditionally, pulsed and wideband chirp transmit waveforms are used. Our focus here is on the design of waveforms matched to extended targets. In the literature, optimum transmit waveform design in additive receiver noise has been investigated both from SNR maximization and information-theoretic approaches. In this paper, we extend the information-based approach to the signal-dependent interference problem. In particular, we investigate the use of information theory to generate the optimum waveform matched to a Gaussian distributed target ensemble with known spectral variance in the presence of signal-dependent clutter. Several waveform design examples are shown. We also apply this waveform technique to a cognitive radar application.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720730","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720730.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-theoretic matched waveform in signal dependent interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720730/","displayDocTitle":"Information-theoretic matched waveform in signal dependent interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425788","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720730/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-theoretic matched waveform in signal dependent interference","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085707S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720734,"authors":[{"name":"Rao M.

Barker code of length 13 was invariably used for the performance comparison of these methods. Present day pulse compression radars with large time-bandwidth products use binary code lengths much greater than 13. Very few results of mismatched filter performance were shown for binary codes of length greater than 100. One of the reasons why the results were limited to shorter code lengths was the computational complexity involved in mismatched filter optimization. For example, to apply one of the earlier methods to reduce peak sidelobes, repeated inversion of 1000-by-1000 matrix would be needed for 1000-tap mismatched filter. In this paper, a simple iterative processing algorithm coupled with minimax optimization to reduce peak sidelobe level is proposed that demonstrates mismatched filter performance for code lengths far greater than 1000. The performance of the proposed mismatched filters approaches that of Wiener filtering techniques but with much less complexity and therefore could be applied for designing longer mismatched filters. Furthermore, with this approach mismatched filter iteration could be stopped to stay within the mismatch loss budget.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720734/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720734/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425792","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of mismatched filters for long binary codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of mismatched filters for long binary codes","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07258S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720734","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4720749,"authors":[{"name":"Shubha Elizabeth Avirah","affiliation":["Electronics and Radar Development Establishment, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Shubha Elizabeth","lastName":"Avirah","id":"38258581900"},{"name":"Anil Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Electronics and Radar Development Establishment, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37555915300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4720749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720749","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directional antennas","Antenna arrays","Surveillance","Radar antennas","Genetic algorithms","Linear antenna arrays","Phased arrays","Transmission line measurements","Antenna feeds","Beam steering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","genetic algorithms","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure mitigation","semi active multibeam antenna array","portable surveillance radar","genetic algorithm","3D surveillance radar","elevation beams","multiple beams","linear arrays","phase alone synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","TR module failure","Multi beam antenna"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720749","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720749.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure mitigation of semi active multi beam antenna array for portable surveillance radar using genetic algorithm","abstract":"Multi beam antenna arrays are extensively used for 3D surveillance radar, providing a shaped beam in elevation and multiple beams in receive. Semi active multibeam antenna system employs 18 TR modules in elevation, feeding 18 linear arrays. The TR modules feed the 18 linear arrays in uniform amplitude and with required phase distribution in elevation to form the shaped beam and also steers the stack of beams in elevation. The required coverage pattern in transmit is attained through the phase alone synthesis. As the number of TR modules is very low and there is no amplitude control using the TR modules in transmit, failure of one TRM will prove catastrophic as far as radar coverage is concerned. Using genetic algorithm, phase only synthesis is used to mitigate the failure of the TRM, by loading the new synthesized phase values using beam steering computer while the radar is in operation. This paper details how genetic algorithm has been effectively utilized to mitigate the TR module failure of electronically steered portable surveillance radar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720749/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10425807","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720749/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Failure mitigation of semi active multi beam antenna array for portable surveillance radar using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure mitigation of semi active multi beam antenna array for portable surveillance radar using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045572S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720771,"authors":[{"name":"Eli Brookner","affiliation":["Raytheon Company, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4696625/4720717/4720771/4720771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dr. Eli Brookner received his BEE from The City College of the City of New York, '53, MEE and DrSc from Columbia University '55 and '62.","He has been at the Raytheon Company since 1962, where he is a Principal Engineering Fellow.

This is exemplified by the development of GaAs integrated microwave circuits called monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). This integration has reached the point where it is possible to now build a low cost 35 GHz phased array for a missile seeker costing $30/element (total cost of array including all electronics divided by number of elements). This is made possible here because integration allows the whole T/R module to be put on a single chip. For some application it will be possible in the near future to put multiple receivers or transmitters on a single chip now. The advances provided by Moorepsilas Law has now made it is feasible to do digital beam forming (DBF) with all its numerous advantages. It is now possible to do DBF for a 2,500 element array at the element level, a major breakthrough. Also covered will be: the potential for GaN and SiC chips which have the capability of a factor of ten or more higher peak power than GaAs chips; arrays with instantaneous bandwidths of up to 33:1; SiGe low cost T/R modules; low cost MEMS passive arrays; a real radar application for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) as opposed to fantasy has been demonstrated by Lincoln Lab MIT which allows coherent combining of two radars to achieve a 9 dB increase in sensitivity; MIMO also makes possible the optimum removal of clutter in OTH and airborne radars by permitting adaptive control of the transmit antenna pattern in the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10425829","htmlLink":"/document/4720771/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Phased-array and radar astounding breakthroughs - An update","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased-array and radar astounding breakthroughs - An update","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058127S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4720793,"authors":[{"name":"Lee K.

Algorithms of this kind have been the subject of renewed research interest as a consequence of the relatively recent advances in linear RF power amplifiers, arbitrary waveform generators, and computational capability. In this paper, we use hardware considerations to argue that constraints on the maximum waveform modulus will generally supersede the total energy constraint commonly found in the literature. In order to illustrate the deleterious effects on system performance that can arise when these modulus constraints are not accounted for, we subjected recently published waveform design algorithms to maximum modulus limitations in simulation, and we present the results here. We also propose a novel arbitrary waveform design algorithm that accounts for both maximum modulus constraints and constraints on the waveformpsilas autocorrelation function. Simulation results that demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm are presented.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720793","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulus constraints in adaptive radar waveform design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulus constraints in adaptive radar waveform design","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720793/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425851","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4720793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulus constraints in adaptive radar waveform design","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083069S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720797,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Bo Liu","id":"37291889300"},{"name":"Zishu He","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zishu He","id":"37278355000"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jun Li","id":"37656910400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4720797","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Frequency","MIMO","Radar","Application specific processors","Gratings","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","FM radar","genetic algorithms","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autocorrelation sidelobe peak levels","orthogonal discrete frequency-coding waveform","fixed frequency pulses","MIMO radar","arbitrary frequency firing order","genetic algorithm","search orthogonal DFCW-LFM","linear FM pulses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","genetic algorithm","discrete frequency-coding waveforms"]}],"abstract":"The autocorrelation sidelobe peak (ASP) levels of discrete frequency-coding waveform with fixed frequency pulses (DFCW_FF) is very large. It is about 0.21 or -13.2dB. Replacing the fixed frequency pulses with linear FM pulses (LFM) can lower the ASP. We investigate theambiguity function (AF) and cross-AF for DFCW with arbitrary frequency firing order. It shows that DFCW_LFM have different AF expression with the DFCW_FF. By setting the relationships between the Deltaf, B and T, we can reduce the ASP, as well as nullify the grating lobes. A modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to numerically search orthogonal DFCW_LFM with optimal correlation properties. Some of the designed results are presented. Their correlation properties are effectively improved. Both simulation results and comparisons show that the method of mitigating ASP and proposed search algorithm are effective for the design of DFCWs with superior aperiodic correlation.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720797","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of autocorrelation sidelobe peaks of orthogonal discrete frequency-coding waveform for MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of autocorrelation sidelobe peaks of orthogonal discrete frequency-coding waveform for MIMO radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720797/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425855","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4720797/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of autocorrelation sidelobe peaks of orthogonal discrete frequency-coding waveform for MIMO radar","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061143S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4720798,"authors":[{"name":"G.

With the development of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform in the communications, the opportunity for a new generation of digital agile radar rises. Old and expensive multi-channel analog agile front ends could be replaced by simpler and cost effective single channel transceivers where the coherent switches in frequency are done digitally. The novelty of the paper is to investigate an agile OFDM waveform so that Doppler can be solved despite the apparent frequency agility. The OFDM performance is assessed from the radar point of view, using the ambiguity function as a tool. Our approach considers a pulse burst, each pulse being implemented with OFDM chips. Three patterns for frequency agility from pulse-to-pulse are studied. Preliminary suggestions to accomplish coherent processing in an agile context are derived.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM waveforms for frequency agility and opportunities for Doppler processing in radar","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720798","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720798.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"OFDM waveforms for frequency agility and opportunities for Doppler processing in radar","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720798/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425856","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM waveforms for frequency agility and opportunities for Doppler processing in radar","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073524S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720800,"authors":[{"name":"R.

But the large amplitude fluctuations of the OFDM signals makes it susceptible to system nonlinearities. This paper proposes a new concept of radar coding using OFDM signals which combines orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and phase modulation (OFDM-PM) or frequency modulation (OFDM-FM). The PM or FM creates a constant envelope signal which allows high power amplifiers to operate near saturation levels thus maximizing power efficiency and OFDM increases the robustness to multi-path fading and also range resolution capability. The feasibility of this signalling as a radar pulse compression technique is also studied, and some codes for constant envelope OFDM signals (CE-OFDM) with favourable autocorrelation functions are introduced.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720802","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720802.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant envelope OFDM signals for radar applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720802/","displayDocTitle":"Constant envelope OFDM signals for radar applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425860","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720802/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant envelope OFDM signals for radar applications","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063874S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720804,"authors":[{"name":"James D.

In this work we have carried out a detailed study on the use of IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) transmissions in a passive radar system. The WiFi transmission sequence has been found to be complex and dependent on the user environment but is dominated by direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. An ambiguity function analysis of the DSSS based WiFi beacon signal has been carried out followed by field measurements using a wireless based passive radar system. Range and Doppler characterization of this system is reported and compared with the theoretical predictions. Detection of moving human targets has been achieved for the first time using 802.11 transmissions. This work shows that this technique has considerable promise for a low cost and widely deployable detection and tracking system.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720810","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of WiFi beacon transmissions for wireless based passive radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of WiFi beacon transmissions for wireless based passive radar","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425868","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720810/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of WiFi beacon transmissions for wireless based passive radar","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036988S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720811,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xia","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Wei Xia","id":"37528934100"},{"name":"Zishu He","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Zishu He","id":"37278355000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4720811","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Phase estimation","Amplitude estimation","Radar antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Directive antennas","Proposals","Maximum likelihood estimation","Multiple signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","estimation theory","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","radar","radar antennas","target tracking","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-target localization","MIMO radar estimation","Capon techniques","APES estimation","multiple-input multiple-output radar","statistical MIMO radar configuration","transmit array antennas","spatial diversity","uniform linear array","direction finding","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["APES","Capon","estimation","localization","MIMO radars"]}],"abstract":"The concept of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is recently proposed inspired by recent advances in MIMO communications.

The second approach is wavefront adaptive sensing (WAS) which uses a horizontally stratified ionospheric model to motivate a new application of blind source separation (BSS) methods for discriminating targets of interest from spatially distributed Doppler spread clutter. Comparison of these two approaches suggests they each may offer significant performance gains under different ionospheric propagation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720844","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720844.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath spread-Doppler clutter mitigation for over-the-horizon radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720844/","displayDocTitle":"Multipath spread-Doppler clutter mitigation for over-the-horizon radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425902","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720844/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath spread-Doppler clutter mitigation for over-the-horizon radar","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062118S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4720848,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Transmitter signal beam- forming on a multi-element array has been created, not conventionally before transmission at the transmitter facility, but, after radar signal transmission, skywave propagation, target scattering, return signal propagation, and reception using an over-the-horizon radar receiver. Transmitter beam-patterns have been created simultaneously from the signal received at two widely separated locations. The first is within line-of-sight propagation of the end-point of the one-hop ionospheric transmitter to target path, and the second from the signal received at the end-point of the two-hop ionospheric transmitter to target to receiver propagation path. These beampatterns are shown to be practically identical. They reveal the target radar return signal direction-of-departure at the transmitter. This example of a-posteriori transmitter beamforming suggests that it will be possible to create multiple simultaneous adaptive range dependent transmitter beams with an appropriately designed over-the-horizon radar. This has several applications including for the mitigation of Doppler-spread clutter.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720867","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720867.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent results in MIMO over-the-horizon radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720867/","displayDocTitle":"Recent results in MIMO over-the-horizon radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425925","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720867/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent results in MIMO over-the-horizon radar","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069213S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720868,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Vouras","affiliation":["Radar Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Vouras","id":"37294569400"},{"name":"Brian Freburger","affiliation":["Radar Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Freburger","id":"37661755100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4720868","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Hafnium","Radar applications","Adaptive arrays","Interference cancellation","Transmitters","Radar tracking","Phased arrays","Frequency","Radar measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming techniques","HF radar","high frequency radar","interference cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","HF radar","self-interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper evaluates the performance of several adaptive beamforming techniques applied to the problem of cancelling interference in a high frequency (HF) radar with transmitter and receiver physically separated by large distances.

The more advanced concepts employ a multidimensional encoding of the transmitted waveforms to further improve the performance and to enable a new class of hybrid SAR imaging modes that are well suited to satisfy hitherto incompatible user requirements for frequent monitoring and detailed mapping.

In summary we propose the shrunken estimator as an improvement over the least squares estimator for range difference smoothing.

SAR transmits chirp signals and the received echoes are sampled into In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) components, generally referred to as raw SAR data. Raw data compression is an essential future requirement for high resolution space borne SAR sensor in order to reduce the volume of data that is stored onboard and later transmitted to ground station. Due to the low computational resources available onboard satellite a simple encoding algorithm based on compressed sensing framework to compress SAR raw data with real wavelets is proposed in this paper. The decoding of the data on ground is then based on convex optimization through projections on convex sets (POCS) or uses greedy algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The option of converting the complex SAR signal to real data by shifting the frequency spectrum by half bandwidth and then using real wavelets as a sparsifying transform to compress the SAR signal is studied and compared with using the wavelets with the complex signal in the CS framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720896.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthetic Aperture Radar raw data encoding using Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Encoding","Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","High-resolution imaging","Chirp","Data compression","Signal resolution","Space stations","Satellite ground stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","greedy algorithms","radar imaging","set theory","synthetic aperture radar","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","raw data encoding","microwave high resolution imaging system","chirp signals","raw data compression","high resolution space borne SAR sensor","wavelets","convex optimization","projections on convex sets","greedy algorithms","orthogonal matching pursuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR","Encoding","Compressed Sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Synthetic Aperture Radar raw data encoding using Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425954","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthetic Aperture Radar raw data encoding using Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074706S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4720919,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri I.

Recently, an instrumental variables (IV) approach to MIMO radar receive filter design was proposed and shown to outperform the conventional matched filter approach.

This paper describes how MIMO techniques can be used to improve radar performance, especially in airborne GMTI applications. A previous analysis of the clutter-to-noise-ratio (CNR) for stationary, surface-based MIMO radar is extended to the airborne radar scenario. Our analysis shows that MIMO airborne radars will have lower CNRs, resulting in smaller losses when observing stationary and low-velocity targets. We also address the implementation of MIMO radar modes using Electronically Scanned Arrays (ESAs). Herein, we show that implementing MIMO techniques within a subarrayed antenna can result in high sidelobes and/or reduced search rates. To address this problem, we describe how space-time waveform coding can be used to improve performance. Two space-time waveform encoding approaches are proposed: (1) an overlapped virtual transmit subarray approach, and (2) a beamspace MIMO processing approach. A third approach, involving conventional MIMO waveforms and irregular subarrays, is also briefly considered.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonadaptive MIMO radar techniques for reducing clutter","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720929","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720929.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonadaptive MIMO radar techniques for reducing clutter","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4720929/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10425987","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonadaptive MIMO radar techniques for reducing clutter","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152131S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4720937,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To date, the theoretical literature on MIMO radar has focused largely on the use of ldquoorthogonal waveforms.rdquo Practical approaches to approximate orthogonality (e.g., via waveforms characterized by low cross-correlation and low autocorrelation sidelobe levels) have also started to emerge. We show, however, that such waveforms can still perform poorly in adaptive systems. For adaptive MIMO radar systems, another factor is equally important; we call it ldquoMIMO Cancellation Ratio (CR).rdquo In this paper, we introduce MIMO CR and assess the performance of standard waveform classes (e.g., CDMA, TDMA and FDMA) with regard to this new metric. Then, we describe how to create new waveforms that facilitate higher performance adaptive cancellation. Finally, we apply our waveform design methodology to the problem of airborne MTI radar, in which STAP techniques are used to mitigate clutter.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720965","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04720965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4720965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO radar waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4720965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO radar waveforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4720965/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10426023","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4720965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO radar waveforms","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06037S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4720965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4720967,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tang","affiliation":["E&E Department, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jun Tang","id":"37290457800"},{"name":"Yong Wu","affiliation":["E&E Department, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yong Wu","id":"37293504900"},{"name":"Yingning Peng","affiliation":["E&E Department, Tsinghua university, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yingning Peng","id":"37279371100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4720967","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","MIMO","Entropy","Transmitters","Spaceborne radar","Detectors","Radar measurements","Phase noise","Object detection","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","entropy","MIMO communication","phased array radar","probability","radar detection","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity order","bistatic MIMO radar","multiple-input-multiple-output radar","error exponent","Neyman Pearson detector","phased-array radar","probability","radar receiver","Stein lemma","relative entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Radar","Relative Entropy","Diversity order"]}],"abstract":"Based on Steinpsilas lemma, we use relative entropy as an error exponent measure to study the detection performance of Neyman Pearson (NP) detectors.

In order to properly capitalize on this spatial diversity, precise knowledge of the sensor positions is required to sub-wavelength accuracy. While GPS can provide good estimates for these locations, remaining uncertainties distort the images produced and limit their utility. In this paper, an autofocusing approach is proposed to compensate for these uncertainties. A cost function is established for the image by evaluating the sharpness of image sub-regions in the neighborhood of known point-like targets. These targets can be identified either from a knowledge base or by examining preliminary imaging results. The cost function is then minimized by adjusting the estimated sensor positions using particle swarm optimization. The algorithm is shown to significantly improve the quality of RF tomographic images, allowing the separation of closely spaced targets that were severely distorted in uncorrected images. Results are provided for both simulated and measured data. A discussion of potential enhancements and wider applications of the algorithm is also included.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721018","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04721018.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autofocusing for RF tomography using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Tomography","Particle swarm optimization","Uncertainty","Cost function","Spatial resolution","Image resolution","Narrowband","Global Positioning System","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focusing","image resolution","particle swarm optimisation","sensor fusion","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF tomography autofocusing","particle swarm optimization","geometric diversity","high resolution images","narrow band waveforms","GPS","cost function","sensor position estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tomography","autofocusing","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Autofocusing for RF tomography using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10426076","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autofocusing for RF tomography using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045169S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4721018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721026,"authors":[{"name":"Cagatay Candan","affiliation":["Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cagatay","lastName":"Candan","id":"37449269100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1538-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1539-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4721026","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":317},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Frequency estimation","Chirp modulation","Delay estimation","Doppler radar","Signal detection","Matched filters","Frequency modulation","Radar detection","Filter bank"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FM radar","Fourier transforms","parameter estimation","radar detection","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal radar receiver","linear frequency modulated signal waveform","fractional Fourier transform","radar detection","parameter estimation","ambiguity function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse-Doppler coupling","LFM signals","Radar receivers"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel receiver structure for the detection and parameter estimation of linear frequency modulated signals.

Several clutter models are proposed in the literature, although the commonly used for sea and land clutter returns is the Weibull one. Our case of study involves that the target is known a priori, the clutter is Weibull-distributed and a white Gaussian noise is present. In this case, obtaining analytical expressions for the optimum detector is very difficult, so suboptimum solutions are taken as reference. One of this solutions is the target sequence known a priori (TSKAP) detector. This detector has several problems because it is designed for specific target and clutter parameters. So, in order to reduce these problems, a new solution is proposed, which is based in neural networks (NNs). The NNs selected are the MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs), which are able to learn from different environments. But, what does it happen if the radar (target or clutter) testing conditions are different of the design ones? In this case, a robustness study with respect to the target Doppler frequency is done for different radar conditions, which shows that the behavior of the proposed solution against this changes is better than the detector taken as reference, the TSKAP detector.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721037","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04721037.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of known targets in Weibull clutter based on Neural Networks.

The data analysis is supported by extending the theory of micro-Doppler into the multistatic domain, and a simplified model of human locomotion is developed.

The amplitude pdf is in the form of an infinite sum of modified Bessel functions while the phase pdf is expressed in terms of the error function. Results show that the amplitude and phase pdfs vary with wind speed, observation angle, and polarization. TM wave has a wider amplitude distribution than the TE wave. The phase of scattered field from sea surface is not uniformly distributed, especially at low wind speed.

We examine waveform and position considerations for a distributed radar system to satisfy these constraints and show their impact on waveform design and image reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721070","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04721070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed RADAR waveform design based on compressive sensing considerations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721070/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed RADAR waveform design based on compressive sensing considerations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10426128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721070/","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed RADAR waveform design based on compressive sensing considerations","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108484S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4721070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721071,"authors":[{"name":"Earnest Lock","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Earnest","lastName":"Lock","id":"37661111700"},{"name":"Raviraj S.

Frequency diversity allows for each transmission to be isolated and processed independently of other frequencies. This paper presents an efficient implementation of a frequency diverse distributed radars, based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), a concept borrowed from wireless communications. OFDM allows for frequency diversity to be implemented using only a single modulator/demodulator with the transformation, using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to move between time and frequency domains as required. The resulting system is significantly simpler, but, as we will show, OFDM places a stringent constraint on the allowed sampling rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04721071.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in distributed radar apertures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Frequency diversity","Demodulation","Transmitters","Neodymium","OFDM modulation","Delay effects","Clutter","Apertures","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","modems","OFDM modulation","radar signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","distributed radar apertures","frequency diversity","OFDM","modulator-demodulator","FFT","sampling rate","fast Fourier transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in distributed radar apertures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10426129","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in distributed radar apertures","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048853S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4721071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4721072,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

Pulse-to-pulse diversity may also be desired as a countermeasure against coherent repeater jammers. Using the multicarrier nature of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing to encode wide instantaneous bandwidth pulses we propose a novel digital phased array architecture which mitigates dispersion effects experienced when the array main beam is electronically steered off broadside. The result is the ability to transmit and receive wideband pseudo-random phase coded pulses with a phased array antenna. Simulation results are used to quantify the benefit of the architecture.

In surveillance operations requiring re-imaging of the same scene, small displacements in array element locations may cause large phase and amplitude offsets. Subsequently, clutter will not cancel out, but will rather persist when subtracting two images, one without the target and the other with the target present. We propose a correlation-based robust technique that mitigates image offsets and rotations and is applicable to synthetic aperture radar urban sensing where the statistics are highly non-Gaussian.

This waveform diversity offered by the MIMO radar is the main reason for its superiority over the standard phased-array radar. An interesting current research topic in MIMO radar is the optimal synthesis of the transmitted waveforms. Recently proposed techniques for MIMO radar waveform synthesis have focused on the optimization of the covariance matrix R of the waveforms, as optimizing a performance metric directly with respect to the waveform matrix is a more complicated operation. Given an R, the problem becomes that of determining a signal waveform matrix X whose covariance matrix is equal or close to R, and which also satisfies some practically motivated constraints. We propose a cyclic optimization algorithm for the synthesis of such an X, which (approximately) realizes a given optimal covariance matrix R under various practical constraints, and which also has good auto- and cross- correlation properties in time, if desired. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar waveform synthesis","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721118","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4696625/4720717/04721118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2008.4721118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4720717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar waveform synthesis","conferenceDate":"26-30 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721118/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10426175","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar waveform synthesis","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049721S","chronDate":"26-30 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4696625","isNumber":"4720717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4696625","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4720717","articleId":"4721118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721122,"authors":[{"name":"J.

There is considerable recent interest in using the Cell Broadband Engine, a heterogeneous multicore chip that provides high performance, for biological applications. However, work in genomic alignments so far has been limited to computing optimal alignment scores using quadratic space for the basic global/local alignment problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of developing alignment algorithms on the Cell, exploiting its thread and data level parallelism features. First, we develop a parallel implementation on the Cell that computes optimal alignments and adopts Hirschberg's linear space technique. The former is essential, as merely computing optimal alignment scores is not useful, while the latter is needed to permit alignments of longer sequences. We then present Cell implementations of two advanced alignment techniques-spliced alignments and syntenic alignments. Spliced alignments are useful in aligning mRNA sequences with corresponding genomic sequences to uncover the gene structure. Syntenic alignments are used to discover conserved exons and other sequences between long genomic sequences from different organisms. We present experimental results for these three types of alignments on 16 Synergistic Processing Elements of the IBM QS20 dual-Cell blade system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5271849","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1610","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5271849/04721368.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Genomic Alignments on the Cell Broadband Engine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4721368/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel Genomic Alignments on the Cell Broadband Engine","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10893801","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Genomic Alignments on the Cell Broadband Engine","sourcePdf":"ttd2009111600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097893S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5271849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5271849","articleId":"4721368","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721384,"authors":[{"name":"R.

With linking and activation potential optimization are better possibilities for PCNN application because four parameters were eliminated.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCYB.2008.4721384","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712633/4721369/04721384.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCYB.2008.4721384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linking and Activation Potential Optimization in the Pulse Coupled Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joining processes","Neural networks","Neurons","Mathematical model","Image recognition","Biological system modeling","Brain modeling","Pixel","Pulse generation","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linking potential optimization","activation potential optimization","pulse coupled neural network","neuron internal activity","pulse response mode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linking and Activation Potential Optimization in the Pulse Coupled Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721384/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"27-29 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10437606","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linking and Activation Potential Optimization in the Pulse Coupled Neural Network","confLoc":"Stara Lesna, Slovakia","sourcePdf":"ICCCYB-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066144S","chronDate":"27-29 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4712633","isNumber":"4721369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712633","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4721369","articleId":"4721384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4721401,"authors":[{"name":"Hesam Sagha","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hesam","lastName":"Sagha","id":"37529521800"},{"name":"Mehdi Dehghani","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Dehghani","id":"37660871800"},{"name":"Elham Enayati","affiliation":["Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Enayati","id":"37659861100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2874-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2875-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4721401","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Face detection","Genetic algorithms","Computational efficiency","Detectors","Image processing","Gray-scale","Filtering","Boosting","Classification tree analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse features","face detection","genetic algorithms","image processing","multiview faces","grayscale images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721401","abstract":"Although Face detection is not a recent activity in the field of image processing, it is still an open area for research.

In this paper, we summarize the existing improved algorithms and propose a novel Bayes model: hidden naive Bayes (HNB). In HNB, a hidden parent is created for each attribute which combines the influences from all other attributes. We experimentally test HNB in terms of classification accuracy, using the 36 UCI data sets selected by Weka, and compare it to naive Bayes (NB), selective Bayesian classifiers (SBC), naive Bayes tree (NBTree), tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN), and averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE). The experimental results show that HNB significantly outperforms NB, SBC, NBTree, TAN, and AODE. In many data mining applications, an accurate class probability estimation and ranking are also desirable. We study the class probability estimation and ranking performance, measured by conditional log likelihood (CLL) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), respectively, of naive Bayes and its improved models, such as SBC, NBTree, TAN, and AODE, and then compare HNB to them in terms of CLL and AUC. Our experiments show that HNB also significantly outperforms all of them.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.234","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5210266/04721435.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Bayes Model: Hidden Naive Bayes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Bayes Model: Hidden Naive Bayes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721435/","volume":"21","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4721435/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840462","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Bayes Model: Hidden Naive Bayes","sourcePdf":"ttk2009101361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112551S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5210266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"5210266","articleId":"4721435","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4721545,"authors":[{"name":"William Enck","affiliation":["Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Enck","id":"37563436500"},{"name":"Kevin Butler","affiliation":["Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Butler","id":"37298235800"},{"name":"Thomas Richardson","affiliation":["Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Richardson","id":"37089136340"},{"name":"Patrick McDaniel","affiliation":["Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"McDaniel","id":"37267790800"},{"name":"Adam Smith","affiliation":["Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security (SIIS) Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Smith","id":"37536440200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3447-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4721545","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":426},"abstract":"Main memory contains transient information for all resident applications. However, if memory chip contents survives power-off, e.g., via freezing DRAM chips, sensitive data such as passwords and keys can be extracted. Main memory persistence will soon be the norm as recent advancements in MRAM and FeRAM position non-volatile memory technologies for widespread deployment in laptop, desktop, and embedded system main memory. Unfortunately, the same properties that provide energy efficiency, tolerance against power failure, and \"instant-on'' power-up also subject systems to offline memory scanning. In this paper, we propose a memory encryption control unit (MECU) that provides memory confidentiality during system suspend and across reboots. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the processor-local level 2 cache and main memory to ensure plaintext data is never written to the persistent medium. The MECU design is outlined and performance and security trade-offs considered. We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. This analysis shows the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with higher access latencies (caused by resume state reconstruction) subsiding within 0.25 seconds of a system resume. In effect, the MECU provides zero-cost steady state memory confidentiality for non-volatile main memory.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Cryptography","Hardware","Delay","Resumes","Data mining","Random access memory","Ferroelectric films","Portable computers","Embedded system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory chip","main memory persistence","memory encryption control unit","memory confidentiality","SimpleScalar hardware simulation","DRAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-volatile memory","main memory encryption"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2008.45","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721525/4721526/04721545.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2008.45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defending Against Attacks on Main Memory Persistence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Defending Against Attacks on Main Memory Persistence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721545/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721545/","accessionNumber":"10425738","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defending Against Attacks on Main Memory Persistence","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3447a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.283454S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721525","isNumber":"4721526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721525","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4721526","articleId":"4721545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4721573,"authors":[{"name":"Vanessa Frias-Martinez","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Vanessa","lastName":"Frias-Martinez","id":"38274504500"},{"name":"Salvatore J.

The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts. Our experimental results based on wireless behavior profiles from users in the CRAWDAD dataset show that the volume of false alerts generated by cluster-based AD sensors is reduced by at least 50% compared to single-profile AD sensors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior-Profile Clustering for False Alert Reduction in Anomaly Detection Sensors","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2008.30","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721525/4721526/04721573.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2008.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Behavior-Profile Clustering for False Alert Reduction in Anomaly Detection Sensors","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721573/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10425766","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior-Profile Clustering for False Alert Reduction in Anomaly Detection Sensors","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3447a367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066892S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721525","isNumber":"4721526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721525","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4721526","articleId":"4721573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721575,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37653917900"},{"name":"Hyundo Park","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyundo","lastName":"Park","id":"37654102800"},{"name":"Debin Gao","affiliation":["Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Debin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37653368000"},{"name":"Jianming Fu","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Fu","id":"37595792400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3447-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4721575","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Monitoring","Control systems","Detectors","Intrusion detection","Counting circuits","Information analysis","Control system analysis","Performance analysis","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-flow analysis","control-flow analysis","anomaly detection","intrusion detection","control-flow-based detectors","system calls","data-flow-based detectors","data propagation","false-alarm rates","production server"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["system call argument","data-flow","control-flow","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Host-based anomaly detectors monitor the control-flow and data-flow behavior of system calls to detect intrusions. Control-flow-based detectors monitor the sequence of system calls, while data-flow-based detectors monitor the data propagation among arguments of system calls. Besides pointing out that data-flow-based detectors can be layered on top of control-flow-based ones (or vice versa) to improve accuracy, there is a large gap between the two research directions in that research along one direction had been fairly isolated and had not made good use of results from the other direction. In this paper, we show how data-flow analysis can leverage results from control-flow analysis to learn more accurate and useful rules for anomaly detection. Our results show that the proposed control-flow-analysis-aided data-flow analysis reveals some accurate and useful rules that cannot be learned in prior data-flow analysis techniques. These relations among system call arguments and return values are useful in detecting many real attacks. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed technique enjoys low false-alarm rates and overhead when implemented on a production server.","doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721525/4721526/04721575.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the Gap between Data-Flow and Control-Flow Analysis for Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721575/","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the Gap between Data-Flow and Control-Flow Analysis for Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10425768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721575/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging the Gap between Data-Flow and Control-Flow Analysis for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3447a392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075678S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721525","isNumber":"4721526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721525","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4721526","articleId":"4721575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721577,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Forrest","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Forrest","id":"37288742600"},{"name":"Steven Hofmeyr","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Hofmeyr","id":"37355644600"},{"name":"Anil Somayaji","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Somayaji","id":"37282366600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3447-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4721577","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":688},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computerized monitoring","Computer security","Protection","Intrusion detection","Evolution (biology)","Computer networks","Immune system","Prototypes","Yarn","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-call monitoring","computer security systems","anomaly intrusion detection"]}],"abstract":"Computer security systems protect computers and networks from unauthorized use by external agents and insiders. The similarities between computer security and the problem of protecting a body against damage from externally and internally generated threats are compelling and were recognized as early as 1972 when the term computer virus was coined. The connection to immunology was made explicit in the mid 1990s, leading to a variety of prototypes, commercial products, attacks, and analyses. The paper reviews one thread of this active research area, focusing on system-call monitoring and its application to anomaly intrusion detection and response. The paper discusses the biological principles illustrated by the method, followed by a brief review of how system call monitoring was used in anomaly intrusion detection and the results that were obtained. Proposed attacks against the method are discussed, along with several important branches of research that have arisen since the original papers were published. These include other data modeling methods, extensions to the original system call method, and rate limiting responses. Finally, the significance of this body of work and areas of possible future investigation are outlined in the conclusion.","doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2008.54","publicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721525/4721526/04721577.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Evolution of System-Call Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721577/","displayDocTitle":"The Evolution of System-Call Monitoring","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10425769","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721577/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Evolution of System-Call Monitoring","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3447a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107161S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721525","isNumber":"4721526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721525","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4721526","articleId":"4721577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721592,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Zhai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Department of Radio Engineering, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4747395/4721592/4721592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianfeng Zhai received the B.S. degree in radio engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Southeast University.","He is currently with the School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University.

The distinct time delay caused by system flexibility leads to the phase lag phenomenon and low system bandwidth. Therefore, the tracking problem of such systems is very difficult and challenging. To improve the tracking performance of such systems, an iterative learning control scheme using the Fourier neural network (FNN) is presented in this paper. This scheme uses only local output information for feedback. FNN employs orthogonal complex Fourier exponentials as its activation functions and the physical meaning of its hidden-layer neurons is clear. The FNN-based learning controller introduced here relies on the frequency-domain method, which converts the tracking problem in the time domain into a number of regulation problems in the frequency domain. A novel phase compensation method is introduced to deal with the phase lag phenomenon, so that the bandwidth of the closed-loop system is increased. Experiments on a belt-driven positioning table are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2006496","startPage":"139","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4740185/04721594.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2006496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier-Neural-Network-Based Learning Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Flexible Components","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy control","Output feedback","Bandwidth","Delay effects","Neural networks","Neurofeedback","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","delays","feedback","Fourier analysis","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","learning systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","time-domain analysis","tracking","transfer functions","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output feedback","uncertain nonlinear system","flexible component","time delay","phase lag phenomenon","low system bandwidth","tracking problem","iterative learning control","Fourier neural network","orthogonal complex Fourier exponential","activation function","frequency-domain method","time domain analysis","phase compensation method","closed-loop system","belt-driven positioning table"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier neural network (FNN)","iterative learning control","orthogonal activation function","output feedback","phase compensation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Feedback","Fourier Analysis","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Physical Processes","Time Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fourier-Neural-Network-Based Learning Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Flexible Components","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4721594/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10370363","pubMedId":"19109089","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier-Neural-Network-Based Learning Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Flexible Components","sourcePdf":"tnn-zuo-2006496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.237244S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4740185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4740185","articleId":"4721594","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4721600,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

Addition is the most complex operation in a floating-point unit and can cause major delay while requiring a significant area. Over the years, the VLSI community has developed many floating-point adder algorithms aimed primarily at reducing the overall latency. An efficient design of the floating-point adder offers major area and performance improvements for FPGAs. Given recent advances in FPGA architecture and area density, latency has become the main focus in attempts to improve performance. This paper studies the implementation of standard; leading-one predictor (LOP); and far and close datapath (2-path) floating-point addition algorithms in FPGAs. Each algorithm has complex sub-operations which contribute significantly to the overall latency of the design. Each of the sub-operations is researched for different implementations and is then synthesized onto a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA device. Standard and LOP algorithms are also pipelined into five stages and compared with the Xilinx IP. According to the results, the standard algorithm is the best implementation with respect to area, but has a large overall latency of 27.059 ns while occupying 541 slices. The LOP algorithm reduces latency by 6.5% at the cost of a 38% increase in area compared to the standard algorithm. The 2-path implementation shows a 19% reduction in latency with an added expense of 88% in area compared to the standard algorithm. The five-stage standard pipeline implementation shows a 6.4% improvement in clock speed compared to the Xilinx IP with a 23% smaller area requirement. The five-stage pipelined LOP implementation shows a 22% improvement in clock speed compared to the Xilinx IP at a cost of 15% more area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer-Fall  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721634/","volume":"33","issue":"3/4","htmlLink":"/document/4721634/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10362619","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer-Fall 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design tradeoff analysis of floating-point adders in FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design tradeoff analysis of floating-point adders in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"7-1108-malik-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.2107S","chronDate":"Summer-Fall  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"4721623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4721623","articleId":"4721634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721635,"authors":[{"name":"Kelsey Muma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/4721623/4721635/4721635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kelsey Muma graduated from the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2003 with bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.

The proposed method, ExorBDD, uses a stage of exclusive-sum-of-product (ESOP) minimization, followed by a stage of decomposition using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). For exclusive OR (XOR)-intensive circuits, experiments were conducted on 19 MCNC benchmark parity circuits (ranging from 5 to 25 inputs), as they are the most representative case of XOR-intensive circuits. The results using the proposed approach show significant improvements over Exorcism4, BDS, and commercial tools. On average, the new approach uses only 30.3% as many look-up tables as are used by Xilinx tools (and only 16.4% in comparison to Altera). On average, the new approach has a maximum combinational path delay of 89.2% compared to the delay with Xilinx tools (80.3% compared to Altera). Experiments were also conducted on non-XOR-intensive circuits. These results show that ExorBDD also performs well for arbitrary circuits.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2008.4721635","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/4721623/04721635.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2008.4721635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining ESOP minimization with BDD-based decomposition for improved FPGA synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer-Fall  2008","displayDocTitle":"Combining ESOP minimization with BDD-based decomposition for improved FPGA synthesis","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721635/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Summer-Fall 2008","accessionNumber":"10362620","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3/4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining ESOP minimization with BDD-based decomposition for improved FPGA synthesis","sourcePdf":"8-1109-muma-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078607S","chronDate":"Summer-Fall  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"4721623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4721623","articleId":"4721635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4721654,"authors":[{"name":"Frank C.

The most fundamental difference between this application and highly successful astrophysical and upper atmospheric remote sensing is the line width associated with atmospheric pressure broadening, ~ 5 GHz in all spectral regions. In this paper, we discuss quantitatively a new approach that would use a short pulse infrared laser to modulate the submillimeter/terahertz (SMM/THz) spectral absorptions on the time scale of atmospheric relaxation.

Coal-fired power generating plants are major sources of sulfur dioxide, so the limestone-gypsum wet flues gas desulphurization (WFGD) technology has been widely used in thermal power plant in China nowadays to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and protect the environment. The absorber slurry pH value control is very important for limestone-gypsum WFGD technique since it directly determine the desulphurization performance and the quality of product. However, it is hard to achieve the satisfactory adjustment performance for the traditional PID controller because of the complexity of the absorber slurry pH control. To tackle this problem, a novel probability-based binary particle swarm optimization (PBPSO) is proposed to tuning the PID parameters. The simulation results show PBPSO is valid and outperform the traditional binary PSO algorithm in terms of easy implementation and global optimal search ability. And it also presents that the proposed PBPSO algorithm can search the optimal PID parameters and achieves the expected control performance with PID controller by constructing the proper fitness function of PID tuning.","doi":"10.1109/CSSE.2008.1154","startPage":"443","endPage":"446","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721667/4721668/04721782.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSE.2008.1154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability-Based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Application to WFGD Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Three-term control","Optimal control","Slurries","Industrial control","Air pollution","Rain","Power generation","Influenza","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution control","flue gas desulphurisation","particle swarm optimisation","pH control","power generation control","probability","search problems","slurries","thermal power stations","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability-based binary particle swarm optimization algorithm","WFGD control","limestone-gypsum wet flues gas desulphurization","thermal power plant","sulfur dioxide emission reduction","absorber slurry pH control","PID controller","global optimal search problem","PID parameter tuning","air pollutant","acid rain precursor","coal-fired power generation plant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary PSO","parameter tuning","probability-based optimization algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Probability-Based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Application to WFGD Control","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4721782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10426774","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability-Based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Application to WFGD Control","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336a443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05104S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4721668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4721668","articleId":"4721782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4721788,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The placement of SVCs in a power system has been posed as a multi-objective optimization in terms of maximum worst-case reactive margin, highest load voltages at the critical operating points, minimum real power losses and lowest device costs. During the genetic algorithm search for the optimal solution, the most critical disturbance scenario is estimated with the configuration of the original power system and each candidate SVC placement. By using this estimation, the SVC placement can be greatly simplified. With a fuzzy performance index, the multi-objective optimization can be further transformed into a constrained problem with a single non-differentiable objective function containing both continuous and discrete variables.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721788/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10426780","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4721788/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Messy Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization Scheme for SVC Placement of Power Systems under Critical Operation Contingence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Messy Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization Scheme for SVC Placement of Power Systems under Critical Operation Contingence","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336a467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075198S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4721668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4721668","articleId":"4721788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4721868,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Li Ji","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Li","lastName":"Ji","id":"37410764500"},{"name":"Xiao-Ming Ni","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ming","lastName":"Ni","id":"37647065200"},{"name":"Hae-Young Bae","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hae-Young","lastName":"Bae","id":"37437823300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4721868","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"abstract":"This paper proposes a new objective full-reference (FR) image quality assessment method with discrete Haar wavelet transform (HWSSIM).

However, the most of existing improved PSO algorithms work well only for small-scale problems on low-dimensional space. In this new self-adaptive PSO, a special function, which is defined in terms of the particle fitness, swarm size and the dimension size of solution space, is introduced to adjust the inertia weight adaptively. In a given generation, the inertia weight for particles with good fitness is decreased to accelerate the convergence rate, whereas the inertia weight for particles with inferior fitness is increased to enhance the global exploration abilities. When the swarm size is large, a smaller inertia weight is utilized to enhance the local search capability for fast convergence rate. If the swarm size is small, a larger inertia weight is employed to improve the global search capability for finding the global optimum. For an optimization problem on multi-dimension complex solution space, a larger inertia weight is employed to strengthen the ability to escape from local optima. In case of small dimension size of solution space, a smaller inertia weight is used for reinforcing the local search capability. This novel self-adaptive PSO can greatly accelerate the convergence rate and improve the capability to reach the global minimum for large-scale problems. Moreover, this new self-adaptive PSO exhibits a consistent methodology: a larger swarm size leads to a better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721967/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"10426958","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4721967/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Method of Self-Adaptive Inertia Weight for PSO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of Self-Adaptive Inertia Weight for PSO","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336b195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060305S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4721668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4721668","articleId":"4721967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4721968,"authors":[{"name":"Jize Li","affiliation":["Electromechanical and Automation Department, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China","School of Aerospace Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jize","lastName":"Li","id":"37656124800"},{"name":"Ping Song","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Song","id":"37307416700"},{"name":"Kejie Li","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kejie","lastName":"Li","id":"37277619400"},{"name":"Jize Li","affiliation":["Electromechanical and Automation Department, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jize","lastName":"Li","id":"37085977946"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4721968","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Birds","Convergence","Genetic algorithms","Space technology","Computer science","Software engineering","Aerospace engineering","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","adaptive selection operator","local optimization","adaptive mutation operator","genetic algorithms","searching ability","searching scope","premature convergence","global best particle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modified PSO","adaptive mutation operator","selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSSE.2008.892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSE.2008.892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721668","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721667/4721668/04721968.pdf","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Selection Operator and Mutation Operator","abstract":"In order to overcome the drawback of classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) such as being subject to being poor in performance of precision and falling into local optimization, a modified PSO is proposed by inducing adaptive mutation operator and selection operator of in PSO.

By means of this approach, you can use a specific particle swarm coding representation and appropriate fitness functions to transform particle swarms within a route planning space into different unique niche sub-populations by introducing a RCS (restricted competition selection) niche generation strategy on condition that all kinds of route constraints are met. During the evolutionary process, all individual particles only evolve within their each own niche sub-populations, thus different extreme value points are tracked out. At the end of evolution, each niche sub-population will generate their own optimal route respectively, so as to produce multiple optional routes for air vehicles. The simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/CSSE.2008.435","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1214","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSE.2008.435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4721668","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721667/4721668/04721971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Planning Multiple Routes for Air Vehicles Based on Niche Particle Swarm Optimization Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4721971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Research on Planning Multiple Routes for Air Vehicles Based on Niche Particle Swarm Optimization Technology","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4721971/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10426962","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Planning Multiple Routes for Air Vehicles Based on Niche Particle Swarm Optimization Technology","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336b211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040763S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4721668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4721668","articleId":"4721971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4721972,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hubei University of Education, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jian","id":"37397004500"},{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hubei University of Education, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37654974600"},{"name":"Liu Zhiming","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering & Information, Technology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Zhiming","id":"37650302300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4721972","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Stochastic processes","Computer science","Genetic mutations","Synchronous generators","Software engineering","Computer science education","Educational institutions","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained optimization","dual particle swarm optimization","genetic particle swarm optimization","genetic reproduction mechanisms","stochastic ranking algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","constrained optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4721972","abstract":"The genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO) was derived from the original particle swarm optimization (OPSO), which was incorporated with the genetic reproduction mechanisms, namely crossover and mutation.

and high processing speed with their parallel process-unit array architecture. The key problems in ASIP system designing are: the design of the programmable processing element (PE) and inter-PE communication mechanisms. A design of ASIP processing element which is suitable for FPGA implementation with RISC like architecture is introduced in the paper. The primary goal of this design is for digital image processing, but it is also suitable for the applications such as radar and communication signal processing. The carefully designed circuit structure and specific instruction set of proposed processing element make it universal, and thus can be tailored easily for many particular applications. The design of the ASIPpsilas functional units and the circuit utilization within the FPGA are presented with great detail and the correctness of the design is verified by some application results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4722379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4722379/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10427349","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Research on an ASIP Processing Element Architecture Suitable for FPGA Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Research on an ASIP Processing Element Architecture Suitable for FPGA Implementation","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336e441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049141S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4722268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4722268","articleId":"4722379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4722409,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xinguang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xinguang","id":"37427896700"},{"name":"Zhang Yanyan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yanyan","id":"37543122600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4722409","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"abstract":"Current operating systems become greater and complex increasingly and a great lot of vulnerabilities and hidden risks are in existence. Host-based intrusion detector is subject to attack relative to network-based intrusion detection because operating systems provide poor isolation. An alterative architecture and method used for host anomaly detector are proposed by making use of the SKAS mode of User Mode Linux Virtual Machine Monitor to enhance the survivability and robustness of anomaly detector on system calls. Even if attackers have gained unauthorized access to system services it is impossible for them to gain access chance to the anomaly detector because of strong space isolation.

Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach to tampered images undergone some attacks like Gaussian blur filtering, Gaussian white noise contamination, lossy JPEG compression, etc.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4722268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSE.2008.876","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721667/4722268/04722494.pdf","startPage":"926","endPage":"930","doi":"10.1109/CSSE.2008.876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Tampered Regions Using Singular Value Decomposition in Digital Image Forensics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Tampered Regions Using Singular Value Decomposition in Digital Image Forensics","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4722494/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10427464","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4722494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Tampered Regions Using Singular Value Decomposition in Digital Image Forensics","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336e926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065747S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4722268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4722268","articleId":"4722494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4722508,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Ren","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37663397800"},{"name":"Liang Hu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37291674800"},{"name":"Hao Liang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China","Department of Information Science and Technology, Changchun Taxation College, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37650690500"},{"name":"Xiaobo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37656790400"},{"name":"Weiwu Ren","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Weiwu","lastName":"Ren","id":"37650746000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4722508","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Intrusion detection","Computer science","Educational institutions","Spatial databases","Shape","Software engineering","Information science","Detection algorithms","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern clustering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["density-based incremental clustering","anomaly detection algorithm","system usage pattern","program behavior","re-clustering updating","1998 DARPA BSM audit data","noise data objects","analogous incremental algorithm","ADWICE","incremental detection quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","program behavior","normal profile","incremental clustering"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed a new anomaly detection algorithm that can update normal profile of system usage pattern dynamically.

Experiments with 1998 DARPA BSM audit data, shows that normal profiles generated by our algorithm is less sensitive to noise data objects than profile generated by analogous incremental algorithm ADWICE.

The first subproblem is the optimal power allocation to every hop of subsignal, when the power of each subsignal is fixed, an algorithm with low computing complexity is expressed to get optimal solution. The second subproblem is the power allocation to every subsignal, a suboptimal greedy algorithm is proposed based on the solution from the first subproblem.

It has some important features compared with conventional method. Firstly, the anti-interference ability of ANN demodulator is better than that in traditional way. In traditional receiver, there must be a band-pass filter (BPF) to filter out-of-band noise; however, in ANN demodulator, the signal is never processed by any filter beforehand. Secondly, the ANN demodulator has necessary function modules for FSK demodulation, including BPF, pulse former, and decoder; however these modules neednpsilat be designed separately but are acquired by ANN demodulatorpsilas self-learning. Thirdly, its process of demodulating signal is concurrent, so the operating speed is rapider than that in conventional way. Finally, ANN demodulator is all-purpose system, that means the same system can demodulate different signals including ASK signal, FSK signal, etc. The effectiveness is proved by the simulation result of MATLAB.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721667/4722542/04722750.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"846","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4722542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSSE.2008.1440","doi":"10.1109/CSSE.2008.1440","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4722750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Demodulation","Frequency shift keying","Artificial neural networks","Band pass filters","Signal processing","Partial response channels","Signal detection","Envelope detectors","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","band-pass filters","demodulators","filtering theory","frequency shift keying","interference suppression","neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","artificial neural network demodulator","FSK signal","antiinterference ability","band-pass filter","out-of-band noise filtering","FSK demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["demodulation","ANN","communication","FSK","SNR","Matlab simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4722750/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Demodulator for Frequency Shift Keying","accessionNumber":"10427707","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4722750/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","volume":"4","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Demodulator for Frequency Shift Keying","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3336g843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033658S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721667","isNumber":"4722542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721667","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4722542","articleId":"4722750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4722751,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China","Institute of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598594800"},{"name":"Yukun Bian","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yukun","lastName":"Bian","id":"37603240300"},{"name":"Xijian Ping","affiliation":["Institute of Information Engineering, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xijian","lastName":"Ping","id":"37299961200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3336-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4722751","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forensics","Artificial neural networks","Splicing","Digital images","Image quality","Mathematical model","Testing","Forgery","Pattern recognition","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image blind forensics","artificial neural network","digital technology","digital image forgery","image splicing blind detection model","pattern recognition","moment features","image quality metrics extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4722751","abstract":"With the advent of digital technology, digital image has gradually taken the place of the original analog photograph, and the forgery of digital image has become increasingly easy and indiscoverable.

Both the channel quality and the spectrum substitutability are discussed. A utility function is built, for the secondary user to obtain the spectrum demand function. Also, in terms of spectrum access opportunities, an equilibrium pricing scheme is presented to show that it is close to optimal in most scenarios. The proposed game-theoretic CR spectrum sharing algorithm (GCSS) highlights the trend of spectrum pricing design that it is not necessarily bad for the network users to behave selfishly.

In a multi-hop MAC protocol, a node uses the common control channel to perform channel negotiation before data transmission. Recent research findings indicate that insecure transmission of control channels open vulnerable holes for the Denial of Service attacks. This paper makes a security analysis for CR network MAC protocols. There are two types of attacks against CR network MAC protocols. Firstly, we study how denial of service (DoS) attack is launched in multi-hop CR network MAC protocols. Then, we explore MAC layer greedy behaviors in CR networks. Our analysis and simulations indicate that such attacks can greatly affect the performance of CR networks.

vertical handover for unlicensed multi-standard spectrum access with cognitive radios","abstract":"In this letter, packet-by-packet vertical handover is investigated as a means to improve the performance of unlicensed spectrum access. The analysis focuses on the optimization of a channel access strategy for a cognitive multi-standard radio node that has the capability to switch between two orthogonal uplink radio interfaces, based on long-term channel state information. The radio interfaces differ for coverage and quality of service (QoS) requirements of primary users. The proposed strategy prescribes a cross-layer selection of physical-layer (transmitting powers) and medium access control layer (handover probability) parameters and is designed to maximize secondary throughput while guaranteeing the primary QoS constraints. Analysis and numerical results bring insight into the impact of network topology, measurement errors and primary QoS constraints on the optimal system design and corresponding performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","volume":"7","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10416566","publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723320/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Packet-wise vertical handover for unlicensed multi-standard spectrum access with cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-wise vertical handover for unlicensed multi-standard spectrum access with cognitive radios","sourcePdf":"5172-tw0812-gambini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063474S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723321,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Rietman","affiliation":["Philips Research, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Rietman","id":"37658432300"},{"name":"Jean-Paul Linnartz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jean-Paul","lastName":"Linnartz","id":"37313021700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723321","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Energy consumption","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitters","Analog-digital conversion","TV receivers","Mobile handsets","Digital video broadcasting","Signal restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM receiver","A/D converter","digital postprocessing methods","clipping mitigation","analog-to-digital converter","MMSE clip correction algorithm","low-power design","digital television reception","mobile phones","battery life"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM, analog-to-digital conversion, clipping,","IEEE 802.11, DVB-T/H."]}],"abstract":"OFDM signals suffer from a large Peak to Average Power Ratio, which requires large power back-offs in the transmit and receive chains. This paper studies two digital postprocessing methods of different complexity that mitigate clipping by the analog-to-digital converter in the receiver. Clipped peaks cause spurious signals on empty subcarriers, which can be used to eliminate clipping artifacts and to recover the original signal. Simulations show that a significant reduction of 3 dB in the headroom of the A/D converter (ADC) is possible, when an elaborate MMSE clip correction algorithm is used. A simple algorithm still allows for 1 dB reduction of the headroom. As the ADC is consuming an ever increasing fraction of the total receiver power, the results are believed to be relevant for low-power design of OFDM receivers, for instance to prolong battery life during digital television reception on mobile phones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak restoration in ofdm receiver with clipping a/d converter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070836","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723321.pdf","startPage":"5177","endPage":"5181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"Peak restoration in ofdm receiver with clipping a/d converter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723321/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak restoration in ofdm receiver with clipping a/d converter","sourcePdf":"5177-tw0812-rietman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039308S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723322,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Future products are likely to adopt multiple antennas to maximize performance. Severe FCC EIRP restrictions impose an interesting system design constraint. In this paper, capacity optimal multiple antenna transmission schemes are investigated for EIRP restricted systems under the assumption that the channel is known at the transmitter. It is shown that per subcarrier antenna power allocation, which reduces to antenna selection at low SNR or when using one receive antenna, is optimal for some transmitter configurations. The improvements in capacity are quantified for representative channels.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723322.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","startPage":"5182","endPage":"5187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity-optimal precoding for multiple antenna systems subject to EIRP restrictions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On capacity-optimal precoding for multiple antenna systems subject to EIRP restrictions","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416568","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723322/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity-optimal precoding for multiple antenna systems subject to EIRP restrictions","sourcePdf":"5182-tw0812-vithanage.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040797S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723323,"authors":[{"name":"Pamela Youssef-Massaad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Youssef-Massaad","id":"38272241300"},{"name":"Lizhong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lizhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276915600"},{"name":"Muriel Medard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"Medard","id":"37268947300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723323","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"Power efficiency is a capital issue in the study of mobile wireless nodes owing to constraints on their battery size and weight. In practice, especially for low-power nodes, it is often the case that the power consumed for non-transmission processes is not always negligible. In this paper, we consider the channels with a special form of overhead: a processing energy cost whenever a non-zero signal is transmitted. We show that under certain conditions, achieving the capacity of such channels requires intermittent, or `bursty', transmissions. Thus, an optimal sleeping schedule can be specified for wireless nodes to achieve the optimal power efficiency. We show that in the low SNR regime, there is a simple relation between the optimal burstiness and the overhead cost: one should use a fraction of the available degrees of freedom at an SNR level of radic2epsiv, where epsiv is the normalized overhead energy cost. We extend this result to use bursty Gaussian transmissions in multiple parallel channels with different noise levels. Our result can be intuitively interpreted as a 'glue pouring' process, generalizing the wellknown water pouring solution. We then use this approach to compute the achievable rate region of the multiple access channel with overhead cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

The proposed criterion adopts both the Chase combining and incremental redundancy based hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) mechanisms and it selects an MCS level that maximizes the expected throughput which is estimated by considering both the number of transmissions and successful decoding probability in HARQ operation. We also prove that the conventional MCS selection rule is not optimized with mathematical analysis. Through link-level and system-level simulations, we show that the proposed MCS selection criterion yields higher average cell throughput than the conventional MCS selection schemes for slowly varying channels.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723324.pdf","startPage":"5195","endPage":"5201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal modulation and coding scheme selection in cellular networks with hybrid-ARQ error control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal modulation and coding scheme selection in cellular networks with hybrid-ARQ error control","volume":"7","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416569","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723324/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal modulation and coding scheme selection in cellular networks with hybrid-ARQ error control","sourcePdf":"5195-tw0812-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076864S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723324","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723325,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Frolik","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Frolik","id":"37274703700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723325","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Rayleigh channels","Wireless sensor networks","Statistics","Power system modeling","Stochastic processes","Interference","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Diversity methods","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","statistical analysis","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyper-Rayleigh fading channel","small-scale propagation models","stochastic models","wireless sensor networks","physical wave model","TWDP model","two-wave with diffuse power model","fading statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fading channels, multipath channels, wireless sensor networks."]}],"abstract":"Recent work presented empirical data for which the small-scale fading statistics were more severe than Rayleigh; a phenomena deemed hyper-Rayleigh fading. This paper considers whether commonly utilized small-scale propagation models can be appropriately adapted to represent this class of fading. The work argues that the most meaningful model for the hyper- Rayleigh regime is based on a physical wave model (as opposed to stochastic); in particular, the TWDP model, where Deltaap1, holds the greatest promise. The crux of the argument is that the stochastic models significantly over-predict the amount of constructive interference in comparison to what is physically realizable.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723325.pdf","startPage":"5202","endPage":"5207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On appropriate models for characterizing hyper-rayleigh fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723325/","displayDocTitle":"On appropriate models for characterizing hyper-rayleigh fading","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416570","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723325/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On appropriate models for characterizing hyper-rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"5202-tw0812-frolik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076259S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4723328,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"},{"name":"Marco Moretti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Moretti","id":"37302219500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723328","dbTime":"54 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":730},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Dispersion","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless LAN","Signal resolution","Distortion","Maximum likelihood detection","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersive channels","fading channels","maximum likelihood estimation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer frequency offset recovery","OFDM transmissions","selective channels","multipath distortions","frequency selectivity","transmission channel","the channel response","maximum likelihood approach","highly dispersive channels","digital audio broadcasting","digital video broadcasting","wireless local area network","multipath fading","impulsive noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer frequency offset estimation, channel","estimation, OFDM."]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset (CFO) in OFDM systems is normally estimated in two steps. The fractional part of the CFO is recovered first and the remaining ambiguity is subsequently resolved by detecting the integer frequency offset (IFO). Conventional IFO recovery algorithms for OFDM signals are sensitive to multipath distortions as they are derived without explicitly taking into account the frequency selectivity of the transmission channel. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme in which the channel response and IFO are jointly estimated using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. In doing so we exploit one or more pilot blocks placed at the beginning of the frame and carrying known symbols. Since the complexity of the resulting ML algorithm may be relatively large, we also suggest suboptimal solutions unifying various earlier proposals. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes over existing alternatives. It is shown that excellent performance can be achieved with affordable complexity even in the presence of highly dispersive channels.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723328.pdf","startPage":"5220","endPage":"5226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integer frequency offset recovery in OFDM transmissions over selective channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723328/","displayDocTitle":"Integer frequency offset recovery in OFDM transmissions over selective channels","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416572","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723328/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integer frequency offset recovery in OFDM transmissions over selective channels","sourcePdf":"5220-tw0812-morelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061916S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723328","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723330,"authors":[{"name":"Atsushi Nagate","affiliation":["Wireless System Research Center, Softbank Mobile Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Nagate","id":"37294615700"},{"name":"Teruya Fujii","affiliation":["Wireless System Research Center, Softbank Mobile Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Teruya","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37290596700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723330","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Time domain analysis","Multicarrier code division multiple access","OFDM","Fading","Frequency estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Computer simulation","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","channel estimation","code division multiple access","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain spreading MC-CDMA systems","4G system","code-multiplexed pilot symbols","impulse response-based channel estimation method","two-dimensional channel estimation method","multicarrier code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA, time domain spreading, channel","estimation, weight, coherent addition."]}],"abstract":"In time-domain spreading MC-CDMA systems, which are candidates for the 4G system, data and pilot symbols are spread in the time domain and code-multiplexed.

For slow fading channels, we show that the proposed MLC algorithm can achieve almost the same performance as the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filtering approach, whereas the computation-demanding matrix inverse for LMMSE can be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723333.pdf","startPage":"5250","endPage":"5256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jointly gaussian approximation and multi-stage LLR combining in the iterative receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Jointly gaussian approximation and multi-stage LLR combining in the iterative receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","volume":"7","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10401663","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723333/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723333/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly gaussian approximation and multi-stage LLR combining in the iterative receiver for MIMO-BICM systems","sourcePdf":"5250-tw0812-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093437S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723334,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiliang Qin","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Qin","id":"37401670400"},{"name":"Kah Chan Teh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kah Chan","lastName":"Teh","id":"37280857900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723334","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we consider iterative multiuser detection over coded code-division multiple-access (CDMA) channels from a combinatorial optimization viewpoint and propose a low-complexity soft-input/soft-output (SISO) multiuser detector based on the k-opt local search (LS) algorithm, which was previously used for solving the traveling salesperson problem (TSP).

To speed up the search process, extended replica folding acquisition search technique (XFAST), which directly reduces the code phases to be searched by folding local signal, provides an efficient approach to rapid acquisition. Nevertheless, after folding the correlation properties of PNcode are degraded; hence, the detection performance of XFAST to weak signal is worse than that of nonfolding methods. To improve the detection performance, a dual-folding acquisition method (DF) is proposed. By folding both incoming signal and local signal, DF extends coherent integration time to enhance detection performance and indirectly reduce mean acquisition time.

The objective for this study is to combine different perspectives from networking and information theory in the design of routing schemes. The problem of finding the optimum route with the maximum spectral efficiency is difficult to solve in a distributed fashion. Motivated by an information-theoretic analysis, this paper proposes two suboptimal alternatives, namely, the approximatelyideal- path routing (AIPR) scheme and the distributed spectrumefficient routing (DSER) scheme. AIPR finds a path to approximate an optimum regular path and requires location information. DSER is more amenable to distributed implementations based on the Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra's algorithms. The spectral efficiencies of AIPR and DSER for random networks approach that of nearest-neighbor routing in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and that of single-hop routing in the high SNR regime. In the moderate SNR regime, the spectral efficiency of DSER is up to twice that of nearest-neighbor or single-hop routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723339/","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723339/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed spectrum-efficient routing algorithms in wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed spectrum-efficient routing algorithms in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"5297-tw0812-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055963S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723340,"authors":[{"name":"Long Bao Le","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723340/4723340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Long Bao Le (S'04-M'07) received the B.

We consider both interference constraints for primary users and quality of service (QoS) constraints for secondary users. Specifically, interference from secondary users to primary users is constrained to be below a tolerable limit. Also, signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each secondary user is maintained higher than a desired level for QoS insurance. We propose admission control algorithms to be used during high network load conditions which are performed jointly with power control so that QoS requirements of all admitted secondary users are satisfied while keeping the interference to primary users below the tolerable limit. If all secondary users can be supported at minimum rates, we allow them to increase their transmission rates and share the spectrum in a fair manner. We formulate the joint power/rate allocation with proportional and max-min fairness criteria as optimization problems. We show how to transform these optimization problems into a convex form so that their globally optimal solutions can be obtained. Numerical results show that the proposed admission control algorithms achieve performance very close to that of the optimal solution. Also, impacts of different system and QoS parameters on the network performance are investigated for the admission control, and rate/power allocation algorithms under different fairness criteria.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723340.pdf","startPage":"5306","endPage":"5315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.070890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.070890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for spectrum underlay in cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Quality of service","Interference constraints","Admission control","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless networks","Noise level","Insurance","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","power control","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","spectrum underlay","cognitive radio networks","quality of service","interference constraints","QoS constraints","signal-to-interference noise ratio","admission control algorithms","power control","joint power-rate allocation","max-min fairness criteria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio, spectrum sharing, spectrum underlay","spectrum overlay, interference temperature limit","admission control, rate and power allocation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for spectrum underlay in cognitive radio networks","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723340/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10444578","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for spectrum underlay in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"5306-tw0812-le.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073338S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"336","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4723344,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723344/4723344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Morelli received the Laurea (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the \u201cPremio di Laurea SIP\u201d from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1991 and 1992 respectively.

A peculiar feature of this technology is the possible presence of interference within the signal bandwidth, which considerably complicates the synchronization task. This paper investigates the problem of carrier frequency estimation in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cognitive radio system that operates in the presence of narrowband interference (NBI). Synchronization algorithms devised for conventional OFDM transmissions are expected to suffer from significant performance degradation when the received signal is plagued by NBI. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel scheme in which the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and interference power on each subcarrier are jointly estimated through maximum likelihood (ML) methods. In doing so we exploit two pilot blocks. The first one is composed of several repeated parts in the time-domain and provides a CFO estimate which may be affected by a certain residual ambiguity. The second block conveys a known pseudo-noise sequence in the frequency-domain and is used to resolve the ambiguity. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed by simulation in a scenario inspired by the IEEE 802.11g WLAN system in the presence of a Bluetooth interferer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723344.pdf","startPage":"5346","endPage":"5355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust frequency synchronization for OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Frequency synchronization","Cognitive radio","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bandwidth","Frequency division multiplexing","Narrowband","Radiofrequency interference","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency estimation","frequency-domain analysis","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust frequency synchronization","OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","spectrum sensing","communication systems","carrier frequency estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","narrowband interference","carrier frequency offset","maximum likelihood methods","time-domain","pseudo-noise sequence","frequency-domain","IEEE 802.11 WLAN system","Bluetooth interferer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio, frequency estimation, interference detection, maximum likelihood estimation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust frequency synchronization for OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723344/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416582","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust frequency synchronization for OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","sourcePdf":"5346-tw0812-morelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109402S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723346,"authors":[{"name":"Michael L.

The considered modulation format is on-off keying with repetition coding across the transmitters. To partially recover the performance loss associated with symbol-by-symbol detection without CSI, we consider the application of multiple-symbol detection (MSD) to equal gain combined (EGC) statistics. We develop a fast search algorithm for EGC-MSD and propose a suboptimal closed-form decision metric suitable for reduced-complexity implementation; performance results confirm that the true and suboptimal metrics perform comparably well. Significantly, the complexity of our receiver, on a per bit-decision basis, is only logarithmically dependent on the observation window length N, and is effectively independent of the size of the MIMO array. We also present the framework for a decision-feedback receiver and obtain performance expressions for the ideal case of error-free feedback; these expressions serve as an upper bound to the performance of EGC-MSD. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the system effectively realizes the diversity gains expected from a MIMO configuration and that the performance of the EGC-MSD receiver approaches the EGC with CSI lower bound with increasing N.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723346/","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723346/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10444579","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-symbol detection for photon-counting MIMO free-space optical communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-symbol detection for photon-counting MIMO free-space optical communications","sourcePdf":"5369-tw0812-riedeger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15483S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723347,"authors":[{"name":"Chris T.

Under quasi-static phase fading, when all nodes have equal average transmit power along with full channel state information (CSI), it is shown that transmitter cooperation outperforms receiver cooperation, whereas the opposite is true when power is optimally allocated among the cooperating nodes but only CSI at the receiver (CSIR) is available. When the nodes have equal power with CSIR only, cooperative schemes are shown to offer no capacity improvement over non-cooperation under the same network power constraint. When the system is under optimal power allocation with full CSI, the decode-and- forward transmitter cooperation rate is close to its cut-set capacity upper bound, and outperforms compress-and-forward receiver cooperation. Under fast Rayleigh fading in the high SNR regime, similar conclusions follow. Cooperative systems provide resilience to fading in channel magnitudes; however, capacity becomes more sensitive to power allocation, and the cooperating nodes need to be closer together for the decode-and-forward scheme to be capacity-achieving. Moreover, to realize capacity improvement, full CSI is necessary in transmitter cooperation, while in receiver cooperation optimal power allocation is essential.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","startPage":"5380","endPage":"5389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of CSI and power allocation on relay channel capacity and cooperation strategies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The impact of CSI and power allocation on relay channel capacity and cooperation strategies","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10444580","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723347/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of CSI and power allocation on relay channel capacity and cooperation strategies","sourcePdf":"5380-tw0812-ng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113732S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4723349,"authors":[{"name":"Don Torrieri","affiliation":["US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723349/4723349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Don Torrieri is a research engineer and Fellow of the US Army Research Laboratory.

A major advantage of the proposed labeling maps is that they are easily generated even when the alphabet size is large.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723349.pdf","startPage":"5401","endPage":"5407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constellation labeling maps for low error floors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Constellation labeling maps for low error floors","volume":"7","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723349/","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416585","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constellation labeling maps for low error floors","sourcePdf":"5401-tw0812-torrieri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05043S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4723350,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["ECE Departments of the University of Minnesota, University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723350/4723350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nihar Jindal received the B.

Given a total system bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to maximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? Dividing the available spectrum results in two competing effects. On the positive side, a larger N allows for more parallel, non- interfering communications to take place in the same area. On the negative side, a larger N increases the SINR requirement for each link because the same information rate must be achieved over less bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold - which directly corresponds to the optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low SNR (power-limited) and high SNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the optimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms of the path loss exponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723350.pdf","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071220","startPage":"5408","endPage":"5419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth partitioning in decentralized wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723350/","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth partitioning in decentralized wireless networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723350/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10416586","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth partitioning in decentralized wireless networks","sourcePdf":"5408-tw0812-jindal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126041S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723352,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277327400"},{"name":"Bhaskar Krishnamachari","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhaskar","lastName":"Krishnamachari","id":"37279596700"},{"name":"Keqin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37404374000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4723352","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":243,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1535},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723352","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Jamming","Fading","Downlink","Throughput","Robustness","Performance analysis","Interference","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","jamming","Markov processes","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["myopic sensing","multichannel opportunistic access","Markov chains","Gilbert-Elliot channel model","channel selection","cognitive radio networks","fading environments","downlink scheduling","resource-constrained jamming","resource-constrained antijamming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic access, cognitive radio, multi-channel MAC, multi-arm restless bandit process, myopic policy."]}],"abstract":"We consider a multi-channel opportunistic communication system where the states of these channels evolve as independent and statistically identical Markov chains (the Gilbert- Elliot channel model). A user chooses one channel to sense and access in each slot and collects a reward determined by the state of the chosen channel. The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel selection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a multi-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure, optimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the myopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel selection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the channel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is established for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based on numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed, which, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum throughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its scaling behavior with respect to the number of channels. These results apply to cognitive radio networks, opportunistic transmission in fading environments, downlink scheduling in centralized networks, and resource-constrained jamming and anti-jamming.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723352.pdf","startPage":"5431","endPage":"5440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On myopic sensing for multi-channel opportunistic access: structure, optimality, and performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"On myopic sensing for multi-channel opportunistic access: structure, optimality, and performance","volume":"7","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723352/","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416587","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723352/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On myopic sensing for multi-channel opportunistic access: structure, optimality, and performance","sourcePdf":"5431-tw0812-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129946S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723353,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Safari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723353/4723353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid Safari (S'08) received B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2003 and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005.

We consider an aggregated channel model which takes into account both path-loss and turbulence-induced log-normal fading. Since fading variance is distance-dependent in free-space optical systems, relay-assisted transmission takes advantage of the resulting shorter hops and yields significant performance improvements. We derive outage probability of the relaying schemes under consideration which are further confirmed through Monte-Carlo simulations.

In such networks, distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) involves a process of joint channel probing and distributed scheduling. It has been shown that under perfect channel estimation, the optimal DOS for maximizing the network throughput is a pure threshold policy. In this paper, this formalism is generalized to explore DOS under noisy channel estimation. In such cases, the transmission rate needs to be backed off from the estimated rate to reduce outages. It is shown that the optimal scheduling policy remains threshold-based, and that the rate threshold turns out to hinge on the variance of the estimation error and be a functional of the backoff rate function. Since the optimal backoff rate is intractable, we devise suboptimal linear backoff schemes that back off the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and hence the rate. The corresponding optimal backoff ratios and rate thresholds can be obtained via iterative algorithms. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the tradeoff between increased training time to improve channel estimation and probing efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723354.pdf","startPage":"5450","endPage":"5460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed opportunistic scheduling for ad hoc communications with imperfect channel information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal scheduling","Channel estimation","Throughput","Ad hoc networks","Physical layer","Data communication","Probes","Costs","Fasteners","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel estimation","iterative methods","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed opportunistic scheduling","imperfect channel information","wireless ad hoc networks","random access","channel probing","perfect channel estimation","noisy channel estimation","suboptimal linear backoff schemes","signal-to-noise ratio","iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed opportunistic scheduling, channel","estimation, optimal stopping theory, ad hoc networks."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed opportunistic scheduling for ad hoc communications with imperfect channel information","volume":"7","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4723354/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10444582","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed opportunistic scheduling for ad hoc communications with imperfect channel information","sourcePdf":"5450-tw0812-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083312S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723355,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723355/4723355-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Lei received a B.S. degree in 2001 and a Ph.D. degree in 2006, respectively, from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, China, both in telecommunications engineering.

The analysis accounts for the applications with a dynamic number of competing flows, such as continuous transfers of file transport protocol (FTP) or web browsing sessions. An analytical model is developed to extend the multi-class processor-sharing model in single-carrier networks to multi-carrier OFDM networks, where the total service rate varies with the number of flows. Based on the analytical model, the scheduling gains in both OFDM-TDMA (time division multiple access) and OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) networks are evaluated for low and moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different from previous works, we focus on the scheduling performance at the flow level and consider a dynamic network setting with random sized service demands. Furthermore, we use stochastic comparison techniques to examine the effects of physical-layer characteristics, such as fading speed and channel frequency selectivity, on flow-level performance. Simulations are performed to verify the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723355.pdf","startPage":"5461","endPage":"5472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flow-level performance of opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723355/","displayDocTitle":"Flow-level performance of opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA networks","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416588","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723355/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flow-level performance of opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA networks","sourcePdf":"5461-tw-0812-lei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103248S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723357,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["ECE Departments, University of Technology, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723357/4723357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nihar Jindal received the B.S. degree in Electri- cal Engineering and Computer Science from U.C.

Transmission power is chosen as the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constant between 0 and 1. The choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar cases of channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. Choosing s isin (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to be evaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. We derive closed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target SINR in a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resulting transmission capacity, which is the number of users/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n that can achieve this SINR on average. Using these approximations, which are quite accurate over typical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of s* = 1/2 minimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of the channel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with a relatively low density of interferers. We also show numerically that this choice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters. Intuitively, s* = 1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while making sure they do not flood the network with interference.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","startPage":"5482","endPage":"5492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional power control for decentralized wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional power control for decentralized wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416590","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723357/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional power control for decentralized wireless networks","sourcePdf":"5482-tw0812-jindal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101445S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4723358,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ma","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723358/4723358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Ma received her B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and M.S. degrees Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.R.

To address this need, MIMO (multiple-input-multiple-output) antenna techniques hold significant promise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad hoc networks is based on an implicit assumption that each link exclusively occupies a geometric area, referred to as exclusion region that characterizes the amount of spatial resource occupied by a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple links can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as interference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, the concept of \"exclusion region\" no longer applies. In this paper, we investigate link-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous work, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by the actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer capacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR (signal to interference and noise ratio) at a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links and the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our analysis shows that there exists an optimal active-link density that maximizes the link-layer throughput capacity. This will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols for MIMO ad-hoc networks. To the best of knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to characterize the capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks by considering the actual PHY-layer signal and interference model. The results in this paper pave the way for further study on network-layer transport capacity of ad-hoc networks with MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723358.pdf","startPage":"5493","endPage":"5503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with MIMO MMSE receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723358/","displayDocTitle":"On capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with MIMO MMSE receivers","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416591","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723358/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with MIMO MMSE receivers","sourcePdf":"5493-tw0812-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086801S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723359,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqing Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4723313/4723359/4723359-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiqing Zhou (S'03, M'05) received the B.S. degree In communications and information engineering and the M.S. degree in signal and information processing from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

Combining the iterative detection in the space domain and the hybrid multi-code interference (MDI) cancellation and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection in the frequency domain, a joint iterative detection is proposed, which enables space and frequency diversity gains to be jointly exploited. Moreover, using a two-dimensional (2-D) averaging channel estimation algorithm, a close form expression is derived for the optimal power allocation between the pilot and all data channels that achieves the best system performance. It is shown that the optimal power ratio mainly depends on the channel estimation algorithm, the number of transmit antennas as well as the number of pilot and data symbols in a packet, but is not sensitive to the changes in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and diversity gains. Simulations are conducted to verify the derived optimal power ratio and study the performance of the proposed joint detection algorithm. It is shown that considerable improvement can be obtained when the number of loops in the joint iterative detection increases.

We consider the scenario where primary users exhibit on-off behavior and secondary users are able to dynamically measure/estimate sum interference from primary users at their receiving ends. For such a scenario, we solve the problem of fair spectrum sharing among secondary users subject to their QoS constraints (in terms of minimum SINR and transmission rate) and interference constraints for primary users. Since tracking channel gains instantaneously for dynamic spectrum allocation may be very difficult in practice, we consider the case where only mean channel gains averaged over short-term fading are available. Under such scenarios, we derive outage probabilities for secondary users and interference constraint violation probabilities for primary users. Based on the analysis, we develop a complete framework to perform joint admission control and rate/power allocation for secondary users such that both QoS and interference constraints are only violated within desired limits. Throughput performance of primary and secondary networks is investigated via extensive numerical analysis considering different levels of implementation complexity due to channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/T-WC.2008.071465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4723313/04723360.pdf","startPage":"5517","endPage":"5527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-WC.2008.071465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint rate and power allocation for cognitive radios in dynamic spectrum access environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723360/","displayDocTitle":"Joint rate and power allocation for cognitive radios in dynamic spectrum access environment","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2008","accessionNumber":"10416593","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723360/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint rate and power allocation for cognitive radios in dynamic spectrum access environment","sourcePdf":"5517-tw0812-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15772S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4723313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4723313","articleId":"4723360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723374,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin Cortez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, ITSON University Cd., Mexico"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Cortez","id":"37391709600"},{"name":"Miguel Bazdresch","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, ITESO University Cd., Guadalajara, Mexico"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Bazdresch","id":"37391709700"},{"name":"Deni Torres","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, CINVESTAV, Guadalajara, Mexico"],"firstName":"Deni","lastName":"Torres","id":"37413690800"},{"name":"Ramon Parra-Michel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, CINVESTAV, Guadalajara, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ramon","lastName":"Parra-Michel","id":"37427093400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2498-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2499-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4723374","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","MIMO","Wireless communication","Proposals","Diversity methods","Transforms","Equations","Interference cancellation","Bit error rate","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wireless communications","ABBA-VBLAST","hybrid space-time code","hybrid MIMO communication","spatial multiplexing","diversity gain","link reliability","quasiorthogonal layer","multiple antenna","linear dispersion codes","interference cancellation receiver","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"Hybrid MIMO communication systems combine spatial multiplexing with diversity gain to achieve both high spectral efficiency and link reliability.

Considering the OSI model, the main development of these radios is focused on the lower layers, which are implemented in hardware. Security is a key element for using software radios, because they can enter to different wireless networks and use the air like transmission medium, being vulnerable to possible attacks to the transmission of data. Several security architectures have been standardized for different networks, such as IEEE 802.11i-2004 for WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks) and IEEE 802.16e-2005 for WMANs (Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks), operating on the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer. In this work, hardware implementations of these architectures are evaluated in terms of FPGA implementation costs and performance to be considered in a reconfigurable hardware platform, which supports both security architectures, working on the MAC sublayer. For the design of the reconfigurable platforms, it is required to examine characteristics such as hardware resources, throughput and reconfigurable/ nonreconfigurable modules with focus in the software-radio applications. These implementations of the proposed hardware architectures are based on the AES-CCM algorithm that is one of the most important cryptographic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2008.4723408","publicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700822/4723361/04723408.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2008.4723408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation cost and performance evaluation of the IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11i security architectures based on AES-CCM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation cost and performance evaluation of the IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11i security architectures based on AES-CCM","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723408/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428041","conferenceDate":"12-14 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation cost and performance evaluation of the IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11i security architectures based on AES-CCM","confLoc":"Mexico City, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12152008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071745S","chronDate":"12-14 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700822","isNumber":"4723361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700822","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4723361","articleId":"4723408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723411,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The quantum relative entropy is always enhanced with the increase of random degree due to the existence of nonlocalized mode in the present systems, while the maximal entanglement can be observed only at some certain randomness for the conventional dielectric structures. In contrast to exponential decrease in the conventional systems, the entanglement degrades slowly with the increase of disorder and thickness of the sample near the nonlocalized mode after transmission through the present systems.

The flow supports circuit level specification in addition to layout level user specifications, so that it can be integrated into an analog automation system.

Our technique implements a level-constrained common-subexpression-elimination algorithm, where we can constrain the number of adder levels (ALs) required to compute each of the coefficient outputs. By specifying a tighter constraint (in terms of the number of adders in the critical path) on the important coefficients, we ensure that the later computational steps compute only the less important coefficient outputs. In case of delay variations due to voltage scaling and/or process variations, only the less important outputs are affected, resulting in graceful degradation of filter quality. The proposed architecture, therefore, lends itself to aggressive voltage scaling for low-power dissipation even under process parameter variations. Under extreme process variation and supply voltage scaling (0.8 V), filters implemented in the predictive technology model (PTM) 70 nm technology show an average power savings of 25%-30% with minor degradation in filter response in terms of normalized passband/stopband ripple (0.02 at a scaled voltage of 0.8 V compared with 0.005 at a nominal supply).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723638/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10362788","volume":"28","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Variation-Aware Low-Power Synthesis Methodology for Fixed-Point FIR Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variation-Aware Low-Power Synthesis Methodology for Fixed-Point FIR Filters","sourcePdf":"tcad-choi-2009135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091443S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4723629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4723629","articleId":"4723638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723644,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Marculescu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4723629/4723644/4723644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Radu Marculescu (S'94\u2013M'98\u2013SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1998.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

We first present a signature-based CAD framework that incorporates tools for the logic-level analysis of soft error rate (x) and for signature-based design for reliability (SiDeR). We observe that the soft error rate (SER) of a logic circuit is closely related to various testability parameters, such as signal observability and probability. We show that these parameters can be computed very efficiently (in linear time) by means of signatures. Consequently, AnSER evaluates logic masking two to three orders of magnitude faster than other SER evaluators while maintaining accuracy. AnSER can also compute SER efficiently in sequential circuits by approximating steady-state probabilities and sequential signal observabilities. In the second part of this paper, we incorporate AnSER into logic synthesis design flows aimed at reliable circuit design. SiDeR identifies and exploits redundancy already present in a circuit via signature comparison to decrease SER. We show that SiDeR reduces SER by 40% with only 13% area overhead. We also describe a second signature-based synthesis strategy that employs local rewriting to simultaneously improve area and decrease SER. This technique yields 13% reduction in SER with a 2% area decrease. We show that combining the two synthesis approaches can result in further area-reliability improvements.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4723629/04723645.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signature-Based SER Analysis and Design of Logic Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Signature-Based SER Analysis and Design of Logic Circuits","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10362791","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signature-Based SER Analysis and Design of Logic Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-krishnaswamy-2009139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050829S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"4723629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"59","articleId":"4723645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723647,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Wei Fang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4723629/4723647/4723647-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia-Wei Fang (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2005 from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering.","His current research interests include flip-chip routing and chip-package-board codesign."]},"firstName":"Jia-Wei","lastName":"Fang","id":"37398096200"},{"name":"Chin-Hsiung Hsu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4723629/4723647/4723647-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Hsiung Hsu (S'06) received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering in 2005 from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering.","His research interests are in combinatorial optimization with applications to the VLSI design automation, large-scale global routing, and flip-chip design."]},"firstName":"Chin-Hsiung","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37402566700"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4723629/4723647/4723647-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Wen Chang (S'94\u2013A'96\u2013M'99) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993 and 1996, respectively, all in computer science.","He is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University.

In this paper, we present the first routing algorithm in the literature for the preassignment flip-chip routing problem with a predefined netlist among pads and wire-width and signal-skew considerations. Our algorithm is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and guarantees to find an optimal solution for the addressed problem. It adopts a two-stage technique of global routing followed by detailed routing. In global routing, it first uses three reduction techniques to prune redundant solutions and create a global-routing path for each net. Without loss of the solution optimality, our reduction techniques can further prune the ILP variables (constraints) by 85.5% (98.0%) on average over a recent reduction technique. The detailed routing applies passing-point assignment, net-ordering determination, and X-based gridless routing to complete the routing. Experimental results based on five real industry designs show that our router can achieve 100% routability and the optimal global-routing wirelength, and satisfy all signal-skew constraints, under reasonable central-processing-unit times, whereas recent related work has resulted in much inferior solution quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4723629/04723647.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.2009151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723629","startPage":"98","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integer-Linear-Programming-Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Integer-Linear-Programming-Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10362792","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723647/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integer-Linear-Programming-Based Routing Algorithm for Flip-Chip Designs","sourcePdf":"tcad-chang-2009151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087999S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4723629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4723629","articleId":"4723647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723697,"authors":[{"name":"Sadegh Farzaneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4747395/4723697/4723697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sadegh Farzaneh (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering (with honors) from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008.","from 1997 to 2000, he was with Iran Components Industries, where he was involved with the design of microwave circuits. from 2000 to 2003, he was a Lecturer with the Electrical Engineering Department, Kazeroun Azad University.

The beamforming structure is designed to have 8-bit phase shifter resolution and 12-bit attenuation resolution.

The low energy proton SEU results are very different for the 65 nm SRAM as compared with SRAMs fabricated in previous technology generations. Specifically, no upset threshold is observed as the proton energy is decreased down to 1 MeV; and a sharp rise in the upset cross-section is observed below 1 MeV. The increase below 1 MeV is attributed to upsets caused by direct ionization from the low energy protons. The implications of the low energy proton upsets are discussed for space applications of 65 nm SRAMs; and the implications for radiation assurance testing are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723737/","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4723737/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10467179","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low Energy Proton Single-Event-Upset Test Results on 65 nm SOI SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Energy Proton Single-Event-Upset Test Results on 65 nm SOI SRAM","sourcePdf":"tns-heidel-2005499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06635S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723739,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The experimental results are interpreted using a model based on the combined effects of band-to-band tunneling (BBT) and the trapped charge in the buried oxide. For negative gate-source voltages, the drain leakage current increases with the drain voltage because the electric field in the gate-to-drain overlap region is increasing. The off-state current in these devices increases with total ionizing dose due to oxide trapped charge build up in the buried oxide, enhanced by the BBT mechanism. The experimental data show that these effects are more significant for devices with shorter gate-lengths. Simulation results suggest that the BBT-generated holes are more likely to drift all the way from the drain to the source in shorter devices, enhancing the drain leakage current, while they tend to tunnel across the gate oxide in longer devices.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2006500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","startPage":"3259","endPage":"3264","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723743.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate-Length and Drain-Bias Dependence of Band-to-Band Tunneling-Induced Drain Leakage in Irradiated Fully Depleted SOI Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723743/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gate-Length and Drain-Bias Dependence of Band-to-Band Tunneling-Induced Drain Leakage in Irradiated Fully Depleted SOI Devices","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467186","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate-Length and Drain-Bias Dependence of Band-to-Band Tunneling-Induced Drain Leakage in Irradiated Fully Depleted SOI Devices","sourcePdf":"tns-felmamouni-2006500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077505S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4723745,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric Wrobel","affiliation":["InstitutdElectronique du Sud (IES), UMR-CNRS 5214, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric","lastName":"Wrobel","id":"37283014800"},{"name":"Jean Gasiot","affiliation":["Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA","Institut dElectronique du Sud (IES), UMR-CNRS 5214, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Gasiot","id":"37268567700"},{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric Saigne","affiliation":["InstitutdElectronique du Sud (IES), UMR-CNRS 5214, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric","lastName":"Saigne","id":"37268628600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4723745","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723745","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium","Error analysis","Neutrons","Radioactive materials","Pollution","Atomic measurements","Radioactive decay","Protons","Isotopes","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","radioactive chemical analysis","radioactive decay periods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft error rate","ground level","linear energy transfer particles","radioactive elements","alpha-emitters","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alpha emitter","contamination","hafnium","impurities","neutrons","pollutant","radioactive materials","radioactivity","soft error rate","uranium"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2005778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723745.pdf","startPage":"3141","endPage":"3145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2005778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hafnium and Uranium Contributions to Soft Error Rate at Ground Level","abstract":"Current technologies are sensitive to low Linear Energy Transfer particles such as alphas.

These devices are well-suited for digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms that are often used on orbit, providing the speedup of custom hardware without the cost of fabricating an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). SRAM FPGAs store the circuit in radiation-tolerant SRAM and SEUs can affect both the circuit functionality and the circuit state. Triple-modular redundancy (TMR) can be used to mask SEUs so that malfunctioning circuitry will not affect the output data. Unfortunately, applying TMR to a user circuit is difficult and unprotected cross-section is possible due to problems with the circuit design, device constraints, or the implementation of the user circuit on the FPGA. Given the complexity of these designs, estimating hardness assurance issues is not simple. This paper will present a tool, called the scalable tool for the analysis of reliable circuits (STARC), that can automatically estimate unprotected cross-section and other hardness assurance issues for TMR-protected circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2006750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723751.pdf","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2006750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automated Approach to Estimating Hardness Assurance Issues in Triple-Modular Redundancy Circuits in Xilinx FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Automated Approach to Estimating Hardness Assurance Issues in Triple-Modular Redundancy Circuits in Xilinx FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723751/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467194","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automated Approach to Estimating Hardness Assurance Issues in Triple-Modular Redundancy Circuits in Xilinx FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-quinn-2006750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066723S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4723753,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These variations are a direct result of the small device sizes necessary to maintain scaling commensurate with Moore's law. Total ionizing dose (TID) primarily affects NMOS device characteristics, which are the most important to maintaining SRAM cell read stability. A test structure allowing direct measurement of SRAM cell electrical characteristics in an SRAM memory bank is presented. Experimentally measured results from this structure, fabricated on a 90 nm process, show impact of Co-60 irradiation on SRAM cell margins. This test structure is fabricated on the same die as a 1.2 Mbit SRAM, allowing comparison of the individual cell characteristics with the overall leakage impact on the large SRAM. The results indicate that by simply providing sufficient margins during SRAM cell design, functionality at high TID can be achieved without the use of radiation hardening by design (RHBD) techniques. The implications for future unhardened SRAMs operating in TID environments and on design to maintain margins are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2007122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723767.pdf","startPage":"3280","endPage":"3287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2007122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Total Ionizing Dose on Unhardened SRAM Cell Margins","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Total Ionizing Dose on Unhardened SRAM Cell Margins","volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467209","htmlLink":"/document/4723767/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Total Ionizing Dose on Unhardened SRAM Cell Margins","sourcePdf":"tns-clark-2007122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046584S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723768,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Dusseau","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Dusseau","id":"38319235200"},{"name":"Muriel Bernard","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France","Astrium Satelliten, EADS Astrium GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37661679700"},{"name":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me Boch","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"J\u00c9r\u00d4me","lastName":"Boch","id":"37268627600"},{"name":"Yago Gonzalez Velo","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Yago","lastName":"Gonzalez Velo","id":"37540667800"},{"name":"Nicolas Roche","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Roche","id":"37529604800"},{"name":"Eric Lorfevre","affiliation":["Centre National d''Etudes Spatiales, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Lorfevre","id":"37353886400"},{"name":"Fran\u00c7oise Bezerra","affiliation":["Centre National d''Etudes Spatiales, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00c7oise","lastName":"Bezerra","id":"37342220000"},{"name":"Philippe Calvel","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Calvel","id":"37331618800"},{"name":"Ronan Marec","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Marec","id":"37353075700"},{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric Saigne","affiliation":["Institut dElectronique du Sud, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric","lastName":"Saigne","id":"37268628600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4723768","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Analog integrated circuits","Annealing","Circuit testing","Temperature sensors","Shape","Current supplies","Equations","Bipolar transistors","Bipolar integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","radiation effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation-induced degradation","input bias current","linear integrated circuits","collector current","input transistor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Annealing","bipolar transistors","circuit effects","dose rate","integrated circuits (ICs)","total dose"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723768","abstract":"It is shown that the variety of shapes of the input current versus dose curve observed in several ICs is due to circuit effects, depending on the architecture, the value of the currents and the bias conditions. When stages are cascaded, the degradation of the second stage may add or subtract current to the collector current of the input transistor. The variations of the collector currents can be evaluated using the variations of the supply current. It is then possible to model the compensation effects using basic equations and study the impact of irradiation conditions. In some cases, the effect of biasing the circuit during irradiation is to reduce the compensation mechanism leading to an stronger increase in the input current.

The pulse broadening mechanism is shown to be predictable from CMOS device hysteretic effects, and technology-normalized values of pulse broadening are quantified.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2006749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723770.pdf","endPage":"2871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Event Transient Pulse Propagation in Digital CMOS","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2006749","startPage":"2861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Single-Event Transient Pulse Propagation in Digital CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723770/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10467212","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4723770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Event Transient Pulse Propagation in Digital CMOS","sourcePdf":"tns-massengill-2006749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073867S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4723772,"authors":[{"name":"Niccolo Battezzati","affiliation":["Department Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Niccolo","lastName":"Battezzati","id":"37393983400"},{"name":"Luca Sterpone","affiliation":["Department Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sterpone","id":"37283245100"},{"name":"Massimo Violante","affiliation":["Department Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Violante","id":"37275742500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4723772","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Costs","Circuit testing","Radiation effects","Tuned circuits","Circuit analysis computing","Aerospace electronics","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","Monte Carlo methods","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo analysis","soft errors accumulation","SRAM-based FPGAs","mitigation techniques","fault tolerance","fault injection","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accumulation","FPGA","radiation effects","single event upsets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723772","abstract":"Single event effects in SRAM-based FPGAs have been widely studied and there is a variety of mitigation techniques that can be used in order to achieve a complete fault tolerance.

These shifts can induce significant increases in device ldquooffrdquo state leakage current. Neutron irradiations show similar degradation at equivalent fluence levels, even though neutrons do not deposit dose due to direct ionization. These data suggest that the mechanism responsible for the enhanced degradation is a microdose effect associated with secondary particles produced through nuclear interactions between protons and neutrons and the materials in integrated circuits. The secondary particles deposit enough charge in the gate oxide to induce a parasitic drain to source leakage path in the transistor. Although the results are demonstrated here for only trench and planar geometry power MOSFETs, microdose effects can impact the radiation response of other integrated circuit types.

As some of these findings and results give new insight into improved inter-facility calibrations and provide additional inputs into ongoing SEE research, a few of the more interesting cases are presented. Furthermore the dasiadetector elementpsila, the Atmel AT60142F SRAM, now in a hybrid configuration, will form the key detector element in the Technology Demonstration Module (TDM) to be flown on-board the PROBA-II satellite, to be launched at the beginning of 2009. This flight opportunity extends the Reference SEU Database with both ground and space data, taken on the same device under identical operating conditions. Additionally, the Reference SEU Monitor concept is employed as the basis for the new Reference SEL Monitor system, currently under characterization and preparation for integration on the TDM. Ground SEU/SEL characterization of this latch-up experiment is also presented as well as the basic concept of the TDM, the PROBA-II Radiation Monitor module.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723790.pdf","startPage":"3082","endPage":"3087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2006896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2006896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From the Reference SEU Monitor to the Technology Demonstration Module On-Board PROBA-II","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Single event upset","Calibration","Detectors","Radiation monitoring","System testing","Random access memory","Time division multiplexing","Particle beams","Space technology","Assembly systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","artificial satellites","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEU monitor","technology demonstration module","onboard PROBA-II satellite","radiation test","calibration data","detector element","Atmel AT60142F SRAM","reference SEL monitor system","PROBA-II radiation monitor module","single event upset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facility calibration","radiation experiment","radiation testing","SEE characterization","SEL monitor","SEU monitor","single event effects (SEE)","single event latch-up (SEL)","single event upset (SEU)","SRAM","test facilities","test sites"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"From the Reference SEU Monitor to the Technology Demonstration Module On-Board PROBA-II","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4723790/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467229","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From the Reference SEU Monitor to the Technology Demonstration Module On-Board PROBA-II","sourcePdf":"tns-rharboe-sorensen-2006896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058419S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723792,"authors":[{"name":"Reed K.

preforms and associated fibers have been designed and fabricated through MCVD process to investigate the role of fluorine (F) and germanium (Ge) doping elements on the radiation sensitivity of silica-based glasses. We characterized the behaviors of these canonical samples before, during and after 10 keV X-ray irradiation through several spectroscopic techniques, to obtain global information (in situ absorption measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance) or spatially-resolved information (confocal microscopy, absorption and luminescence on preform). These tests showed that, for the Ge-doped fiber and in the 300-900 nm range, the radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) can be explained by absorption bands associated with the following radiation-induced point defects: Ge(l); Ge-NBOHC and GeX. Other defects such as GeE' Ge(2); and Ge-ODC are generated but do not contribute in this spectral domain. For the F-doped sample, the different point defects identified, SiE', Si-NBOHC and Si-ODC(II), are unable to reproduce the RIA spectra for energies lower than 4 eV. We suggest that the radiation-induced absorption in this part of the spectrum is due to chlorine-related species, probably CI\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sup>\n radiolytic groups that absorb at around 3.5 eV. The comparison between the sensitivities of the preform and the fiber reveals the influence of the drawing process on the glass response. Its effect is strongly dose-dependent for the germanosilicate glass. The drawing process seems to be responsible for the main part of the defects generated at low doses (<1 Mrad).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2007297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723797.pdf","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3482","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2007297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Effects on Silica-Based Preforms and Optical Fibers\u2014I: Experimental Study With Canonical Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Effects on Silica-Based Preforms and Optical Fibers\u2014I: Experimental Study With Canonical Samples","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4723797/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467236","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Effects on Silica-Based Preforms and Optical Fibers\u2014I: Experimental Study With Canonical Samples","sourcePdf":"tns-girard-2007297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094128S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":4723799,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Liu","affiliation":["International Rectifier Corporation, El Segundo, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406039400"},{"name":"Jeffery L.

The primary factors affecting the single event pulse width in triple-well NMOSFETs are the separation of deposited charge due to the n-well, potential rise in the p-well followed by the injection of electrons into the p-well by the source, and removal of holes by the p-well contact. Design parameters of p-wells, such as contact area, doping depth and placement, are varied to reduce single event pulse widths. Pulse width decreases as the area of the p-well contacts increases, the p-well contacts become deeper, and the p-well contacts are placed more frequently. Increasing the p-well-n-well junction depth also causes the full width half rail (FWHR) pulse width to decrease.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2005831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723805.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2005831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","startPage":"2948","endPage":"2956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Event Mechanisms in 90 nm Triple-Well CMOS Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Mechanisms in 90 nm Triple-Well CMOS Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467244","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4723805/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Mechanisms in 90 nm Triple-Well CMOS Devices","sourcePdf":"tns-roy-2005831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055033S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4723807,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The propagation-induced pulse broadening (PIPB) effect is shown to determine the SET pulse width measured at the output of long chains of inverters after irradiation. Initially, narrow transients, less than 200 ps at the struck inverter, are progressively broadened into the nanosecond range. PIPB is induced by dynamic floating body effects (also called history effects) in SOI and bulk transistors, which depend on the bias state of the transistors before irradiation. Implications for SET hardness assurance, circuit modelling and hardening are discussed. Floating body and PIPB effects are usually not taken into account in circuit models, which can lead to large underestimation of SET sensitivity when using simulation techniques like fault injection in complex circuits.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2007724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723807.pdf","startPage":"2842","endPage":"2853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2007724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the Propagation Induced Pulse Broadening (PIPB) Effect on Single Event Transients in SOI and Bulk Inverter Chains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723807/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the Propagation Induced Pulse Broadening (PIPB) Effect on Single Event Transients in SOI and Bulk Inverter Chains","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467150","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723807/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the Propagation Induced Pulse Broadening (PIPB) Effect on Single Event Transients in SOI and Bulk Inverter Chains","sourcePdf":"tns-vferlet-cavrois-2007724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141018S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4723808,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Oxide characterizations appear necessary to understand ionizing dose effects on devices and then on image sensors. The main degradations observed are photodiode dark current increases (caused by a generation current enhancement), minimum size NMOSFET off-state current rises and minimum size PMOSFET radiation induced narrow channel effects. All these effects are attributed to the shallow trench isolation degradation which appears much more sensitive to ionizing radiation than inter layer dielectrics. Unusual post annealing effects are reported in these thick oxides. Finally, the consequences on sensor design are discussed thanks to an irradiated pixel array and a comparison with previous work is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2005294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723712/04723808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2005294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723712","startPage":"3494","endPage":"3501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Total Dose Evaluation of Deep Submicron CMOS Imaging Technology Through Elementary Device and Pixel Array Behavior Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Total Dose Evaluation of Deep Submicron CMOS Imaging Technology Through Elementary Device and Pixel Array Behavior Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10467152","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4723808/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total Dose Evaluation of Deep Submicron CMOS Imaging Technology Through Elementary Device and Pixel Array Behavior Analysis","sourcePdf":"tns-goiffon-2005294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155002S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4723712","articleId":"4723808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4723826,"authors":[{"name":"Kamal Hadad","affiliation":["The Aerospace, MechanicalEngineering Department, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, USA","The Department of Nuclear Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Hadad","id":"37658275900"},{"name":"Mojtaba Mortazavi","affiliation":["The Department of Nuclear Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Mortazavi","id":"37664443900"},{"name":"Mojtaba Mastali","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Mastali","id":"37662105900"},{"name":"Ali Akbar Safavi","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Akbar","lastName":"Safavi","id":"37398545400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"4723826","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault detection","Power generation","Principal component analysis","Backpropagation algorithms","Discrete event simulation","Fault diagnosis","Multilayer perceptrons","Multi-layer neural network","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fission reactor fuel","light water reactors","network topology","nuclear engineering computing","nuclear power stations","perceptrons","principal component analysis","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","VVER nuclear power plant","principal component analysis","PCA","dimension reduction approach","multilayer perceptron neural network","resilient backpropagation algorithm","network topology","Moving Temporal Window","robustness","fuel rods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","fault detection","moving temporal window (MTW)","principal component analysis (PCA)","VVER 1000"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4723826","abstract":"This paper presents a neural network based fault diagnosing approach which allows dynamic fault identification. The method utilizes the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to dramatically reduce the problem dimension. Such a dimension reduction approach leads to faster diagnosing and allows a better graphical presentation of the results. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two methodologies are used to train the neural network (NN). At first, a training matrix composed of 15 variables is used to train a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) with resilient backpropagation (RP) algorithm. Employing the proposed method, a more accurate and simpler network is designed where the input size is reduced from 15 to 6 variables for training the NN. In short, the application of PCA highly reduces the network topology and allows employing more efficient training algorithms. The developed networks use, as input, a short set (in a moving temporal window (MTW)) of recent measurements of each variable avoiding the necessity of using starting events. The accuracy, generalization ability and reliability of the designed networks are verified using 10 simulated events data from a VVER-1000 simulator. Noise is added to the data to evaluate robustness of the method, and the method again shows to be effective and powerful.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2008.2006491","startPage":"3611","endPage":"3619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2008.2006491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723814","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4723814/04723826.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Neural Network Based Fault Detection of a VVER Nuclear Power Plant With the Aid of Principal Component Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723826/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Neural Network Based Fault Detection of a VVER Nuclear Power Plant With the Aid of Principal Component Analysis","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4723826/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10467257","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Neural Network Based Fault Detection of a VVER Nuclear Power Plant With the Aid of Principal Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"tns-hadad-2006491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092154S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4723814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4723814","articleId":"4723826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4723919,"authors":[{"name":"Alan D.

We also describe the effect of the size of the input datasets on the structure and execution profiles of these workflows. Finally, we describe a workflow generator that produces synthetic, parameterizable workflows that closely resemble the workflows that we characterize. We make these workflows available to the community to be used as benchmarks for evaluating various workflow systems and scheduling algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WORKS.2008.4723958","publicationTitle":"2008 Third Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711036/4723954/04723958.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WORKS.2008.4723958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4723954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of scientific workflows","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of scientific workflows","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10437602","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4723958/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4723958/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of scientific workflows","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079537S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711036","isNumber":"4723954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711036","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"4723954","articleId":"4723958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4724193,"authors":[{"name":"Srinath Kota","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Lab, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Srinath","lastName":"Kota","id":"37649791700"},{"name":"Mo Jamshidi","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Lab, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Jamshidi","id":"37270892300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2172-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2173-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Target tracking","Helicopters","Control systems","Cameras","Satellite ground stations","System testing","Aircraft","Laboratories","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","helicopters","image sequences","target tracking","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATS","aerial tracking and surveillance system","quad rotor helicopters","off-the-shelf components","commercial quad-rotor","Draganflyer V Ti","flight controller","visual tracking","ground targets","ground station","aircraft","laboratory targets","image sequences","simulator program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["connectivity","autonomy","unmanned and system of systems","quadrotor","groundstation","image recognition"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. Quad rotor helicopters are becoming a popular research platform due to the availability of off-the-shelf components and their suitability for useful applications. We describe the aerial tracking and surveillance system (ATS) that we are commissioning which takes a commercial quad-rotor (Draganflyer V Ti) and high-level flight controller, and adapt these for use in applications requiring the visual tracking of ground targets. This uses a camera on board processing system, which communicates summary information to a ground station. So far we have tested the system off the aircraft using laboratory targets and image sequences; we have also developed algorithms to scan a target area using a simulator program. The next step is to integrate these into the quad-rotor, and begin testing.","doi":"10.1109/SYSOSE.2008.4724193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYSOSE.2008.4724193","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on System of Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695854/4724130/04724193.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATS: Aerial Tracking and Surveillance System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ATS: Aerial Tracking and Surveillance System","conferenceDate":"2-4 June 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10425657","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATS: Aerial Tracking and Surveillance System","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12112008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042892S","chronDate":"2-4 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695854","isNumber":"4724130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695854","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4724130","articleId":"4724193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4724195,"authors":[{"name":"Aldo Jaimes","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Lab, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Aldo","lastName":"Jaimes","id":"37528303700"},{"name":"Srinath Kota","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Lab, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Srinath","lastName":"Kota","id":"37649791700"},{"name":"Jose Gomez","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Lab, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37594709900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2172-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2173-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724195","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Airplanes","Satellite ground stations","Global Positioning System","Image recognition","Cameras","Fires","Robot sensing systems","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft landing guidance","Global Positioning System","image recognition","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle","video surveillance","fixed wing airplane swarm","GPS location","image recognition","ground station","heterogeneous system","human control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["networking architectures","quad-rotor","fixed wing","dragonflyer","UAV","connectivity","autonomy","emergence","unmanned and system of systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724195","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to obtain surveillance through a swarm of fixed wing airplanes and quad-rotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).

Damage to the hippocampus is frequently associated with epilepsy, stroke, and dementia (Alzheimer's disease) and is considered to underlie the memory deficits related to these neurological conditions. The essential goals of the multi-laboratory effort include: (1) experimental study of neuron and neural network function-how does the hippocampus encode information? (2) formulation of biologically realistic models of neural system dynamics-can that encoding process be described mathematically to realize a predictive model of how the hippocampus responds to any event? (3) microchip implementation of neural system models-can the mathematical model be realized as a set of electronic circuits to achieve parallel processing, rapid computational speed, and miniaturization? and (4) creation of hybrid neuron-silicon interfaces-can structural and functional connections between electronic devices and neural tissue be achieved for long-term, bi-directional communication with the brain? By integrating solutions to these component problems, we are realizing a microchip-based model of hippocampal nonlinear dynamics that can perform the same function as part of the hippocampus. Through bi-directional communication with other neural tissue that normally provides the inputs and outputs to/from a damaged hippocampal area, the biomimetic model could serve as a neural prosthesis. A proof-of-concept will be presented in which the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice is surgically removed and is replaced by a microchip model of CA3 nonlinear dynamics-the \"hybrid\" hippocampal circuit displays normal physiological properties. How the work in brain slices is being extended to behaving animals also will be described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2008","volume":"1","accessionNumber":"10712651","pubMedId":"22274903","publicationDate":"2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724210/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Neurotechnology on Rehabilitation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Neurotechnology on Rehabilitation","sourcePdf":"rbme-tberger-2008687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.353233S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"4689462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4689462","articleId":"4724210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4724229,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Reddy Manumachu","affiliation":["University College Dublin, Dublin, IE"],"firstName":"Ravi Reddy","lastName":"Manumachu"},{"name":"Alexey Lastovetsky","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Lastovetsky","id":"37282667600"},{"name":"Pedro Alonso","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computation, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Alonso","id":"37299688000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3472-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"4724229","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed computing","Concurrent computing","Libraries","Linear algebra","Computer science","Informatics","Educational institutions","Equations","Computer networks","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematics computing","matrix decomposition","parallel programming","software libraries","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable dense factorizations","heterogeneous computational clusters","LU factorization","heterogeneous ScaLAPACK library","linear equations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous parallel computing","Heterogeneous ScaLAPACK","Heterogeneous PBLAS","HeteroMPI","mpC","MPI","ScaLAPACK","PBLAS"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the design and the implementation of the LU factorization routines included in the Heterogeneous ScaLAPACK library, which is built on top of ScaLAPACK.

In the second case, a chromosome corresponds to an assignment of each macro node to specified processor. We have tested a mixed fitness function, which can switch between two sub functions: cut min value and difference between the maximally and minimally loaded macro nodes in an individual. As our experiments have shown, it allows to adjust the behavior of a genetic algorithm to the requirements of the computational system.

Quorums have been substantially studied in static settings, however the design and analysis of quorum-based distributed services in resource-limited ad hoc networks is a relatively unexplored area. The pioneering work of Chockler, Gilbert, and Patt-Shamir considers such networks and proposes an implementation of probabilistic quorum systems with per-node communication bit complexity of O(log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n n), where n is the number of nodes. The authors assumes a priori knowledge of node failure probability p, where 0 \u00bf p < 1/4. Additionally their work overlooks the cost of gathering responses from quorum members by the client. We present a new probabilistic quorum construction with a lower, per quorum access, communication bit complexity of O(log n) for multi-hop networks. Our quorum access algorithm is based on self-sampling by the nodes themselves, in a way equivalent to accessing a quorum set, with high probability. In addition, we provide a novel on-line algorithm to estimate the node failure probability parameter p, thus removing the assumption that it is known a priori. This is accomplished with per node communication bit complexity of O(log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n n). We demonstrate the utility of our construction by presenting a single-writer, multi-reader algorithm that uses our probabilistic quorums to implement atomic objects in ad hoc networks, where consistency is guaranteed with high probability. We include simulation results illustrating the high probability guarantee for our atomic memory service.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPDC.2008.61","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724213/4724214/04724268.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"374","doi":"10.1109/ISPDC.2008.61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spontaneous, Self-Sampling Quorum Systems for Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spontaneous, Self-Sampling Quorum Systems for Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724268/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10438406","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spontaneous, Self-Sampling Quorum Systems for Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"3472a367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058377S","chronDate":"1-5 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724213","isNumber":"4724214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724213","xplore-issue":"4724214","articleId":"4724268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724279,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Kokosinski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cracow University of Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kokosinski","id":"37267042800"},{"name":"Bartlomiej Malus","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cracow University of Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Bartlomiej","lastName":"Malus","id":"37662016000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3472-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-5352"}],"articleNumber":"4724279","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Application software","Registers","Computational geometry","Computer architecture","Logic arrays","Distributed computing","Concurrent computing","Parallel processing","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","microprocessor chips","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementations","field programmable gate arrays","parallel associative processor","multi-comparand multi-search operations","parallel processing","computational geometry","graph theory","VHDL","Xilinx Foundation ISE software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel associative processor","SIMD","FPGA processor","bit-parallel processing","multiple-search"]}],"abstract":"Multi-comparand associative processors are efficient in parallel processing of complex search problems that arise from many application areas including computational geometry, graph theory and list/matrix computations.

Supporting such task graphs and optimizing their end-to-end network performances in heterogeneous computing environments are critical to the success of these distributed applications that require fast response. We construct analytical models for computing modules, network nodes, and communication links to estimate data processing and transport overhead, and formulate the task graph mapping with node reuse and resource sharing for minimum end-to-end delay as an NP-complete optimization problem. We propose a heuristic approach to this problem that recursively computes and maps the critical path to the network using a dynamic programming-based procedure. The performance superiority of the proposed approach is justified by an extensive set of experiments on simulated data sets in comparison with existing methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724287","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724286/4724287/04724296.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2008.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2008.40","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting Distributed Application Workflows in Heterogeneous Computing Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724296/","displayDocTitle":"Supporting Distributed Application Workflows in Heterogeneous Computing Environments","htmlLink":"/document/4724296/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10438421","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting Distributed Application Workflows in Heterogeneous Computing Environments","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3434a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066151S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724286","isNumber":"4724287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724286","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4724287","articleId":"4724296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724320,"authors":[{"name":"Kunal Agrawal","affiliation":["CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Kunal","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37408110300"},{"name":"Anne Benoit","affiliation":["LIP, \uc492cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37408200000"},{"name":"Yves Robert","affiliation":["LIP, \uc492cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Robert","id":"37283850600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3434-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"4724320","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Delay","Feedback loop","Polynomials","Approximation algorithms","Streaming media","Concurrent computing","Distributed computing","USA Councils","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","feedback","graph theory","multi-threading","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear workflow mapping","linear workflow scheduling","multithreaded systems","computation/communication overlap","architectural model","throughput","latency","complexity","approximation algorithms","feedback loops","linear chain applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mapping","linear workflow","feedback loop","communication/computation overlap","bounded multi-port","complexity results","approximation algorithms"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents theoretical results for mapping and scheduling linear workflows onto heterogeneous platforms.

We also consider the implications of adding feedback loops to linear chain applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2008.107","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724286/4724287/04724320.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2008.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping Linear Workflows with Computation/Communication Overlap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mapping Linear Workflows with Computation/Communication Overlap","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10438440","htmlLink":"/document/4724320/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping Linear Workflows with Computation/Communication Overlap","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3434a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08424S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724286","isNumber":"4724287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724286","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4724287","articleId":"4724320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4724415,"authors":[{"name":"Athinayaranan Vallavaraj","affiliation":["Caledonian College of Engineering, Sultanate of Oman, Oman"],"firstName":"Athinayaranan","lastName":"Vallavaraj","id":"37279266000"},{"name":"Brian G.

Alternative SLM techniques use shift register scramblers to embed the side information into the transmitted OFDM symbols. In this paper the concept of an SLM Simplified Scrambler is introduced. The advantages of this technique are (a) no explicit side information is transmitted, and (b) the simplified scrambler helps to avoid the problem of shift register error propagation in the receiver descrambler. The Simplified Scrambler SLM-OFDM approach is investigated in terms of PAPR reduction, Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance. It is shown that the Simplified Scrambler SLM-OFDM technique exhibits the same PSD and BER as general OFDM as well as improving the BER performance over SLM shift-register scrambler techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2008.36","publicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724286/4724287/04724415.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2008.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the PAPR of OFDM Using a Simplified Scrambling SLM Technique with No Explicit Side Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724415/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the PAPR of OFDM Using a Simplified Scrambling SLM Technique with No Explicit Side Information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10428512","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724415/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the PAPR of OFDM Using a Simplified Scrambling SLM Technique with No Explicit Side Information","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3434a902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064292S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724286","isNumber":"4724287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724286","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4724287","articleId":"4724415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4724440,"authors":[{"name":"Yuji Kubota","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37647647000"},{"name":"Shun Shiramatsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Shiramatsu","id":"37661985900"},{"name":"Masatoshi Yoshida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37657120500"},{"name":"Kazunori Komatani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Komatani","id":"37273821000"},{"name":"Tetsuya Ogata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"},{"name":"Hiroshi G.

The 3D visualizer implemented in Java 3D displays topic transition and each sound stream as a beam originating from the microphones (overview mode), shows temporal snapshots with/without specifying focusing areas (zoom-and-filter mode), and shows detailed information about a particular sound stream (details-on-demand mode). This three-mode visualization will give the user auditory awareness enhanced by HARK and SalienceGraph. In addition, a face-tracking system automatically determines the user's intention by tracking the user's face. The resulting system will enable users to manage and browse auditory scene files effectively, so it should acceleration and support the information explosion to compensate the lack of auditory awareness.","doi":"10.1109/ISUC.2008.59","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Universal Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724419/4724420/04724440.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Universal Communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISUC.2008.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Auditory Scene Visualizer with Face Tracking: Design and Implementation for Auditory Awareness Compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Visualization","Microphone arrays","Information filtering","Information filters","Natural language processing","Java","Three dimensional displays","Acceleration","Explosions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auditory displays","data visualisation","face recognition","Java","microphone arrays","natural language processing","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D auditory scene visualizer","face tracking","auditory awareness compensation","machine audition system","HARK","microphone array","natural language processing","SalienceGraph","discourse salience","Java 3D displays","three- mode visualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auditory scene visualizer","face tracking","auditory awareness","computational auditory scene analysis","discourse salience."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"3D Auditory Scene Visualizer with Face Tracking: Design and Implementation for Auditory Awareness Compensation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724440/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"15-16 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10438533","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Auditory Scene Visualizer with Face Tracking: Design and Implementation for Auditory Awareness Compensation","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"3433a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058838S","chronDate":"15-16 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724419","isNumber":"4724420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724419","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4724420","articleId":"4724440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4724457,"authors":[{"name":"Kikuo Maekawa","affiliation":["Department Language Research, The National Institute for Japanese Language, Japan"],"firstName":"Kikuo","lastName":"Maekawa","id":"37646983200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3433-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724457","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Internet","Books","Speech","Libraries","Copyright protection","Government","History","Writing","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linguistics","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese","word balanced corpus","KOTONOHA super-corpus","modern Japanese","statistical population"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["balanced corpus","random sampling","copyright law","BCCWJ","KOTONOHA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724457","abstract":"Compilation of a hundred million word balanced corpus named Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) is underway at the National Institute for Japanese Language.

In the early stage of software development, it can be used to validate software models. If the result of model checking is false, producing a counterexample, the developer fixes the target model employing information obtained from the counterexample. However, as no systematic method is known, how to fix the model is highly dependent on the developer's skill and experience. In this paper, we propose an iterative method for fixing models based on counterexamples. For this purpose, multi-valued transition systems (four-valued, to be precise) are used to allow iterative model improvement. Firstly, a MVTS model that satisfies all properties validated so far is generated. Secondly, another MVTS model is synthesized from the counterexample that avoids the paths to lead to the counterexample. Then, the two models are merged using the behavioral model merging technique. The advantage of our approach is that both safety properties and liveness properties can be treated in the same way.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","Programming","Software systems","Software engineering","Art","Iterative methods","Software safety","Fault detection","Logic","System analysis and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","merging","program verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative model fixing","counterexamples","model checking","formal technique","software verification","multi-valued transition systems","behavioral model merging technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model Fixing","Model Checking","Model Merging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APSEC.2008.13","publicationTitle":"2008 15th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724512/4724513/04724568.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2008.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Model Fixing with Counterexamples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Model Fixing with Counterexamples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724568/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724568/","accessionNumber":"10438648","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Model Fixing with Counterexamples","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3446a369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075525S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724512","isNumber":"4724513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724512","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4724513","articleId":"4724568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4724604,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37535766600"},{"name":"Tingzhi Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tingzhi","lastName":"Shen","id":"37290789000"},{"name":"Kin Man Lam","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Kin Man","lastName":"Lam","id":"37345646000"},{"name":"Sanyuan Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Sanyuan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37072266200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724604","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724604","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Clustering algorithms","Signal resolution","Image reconstruction","Information science","Signal processing algorithms","Statistics","Power engineering and energy","Computational intelligence","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","image classification","image reconstruction","image resolution","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-based super-resolution","patch classification","KPCA","high-resolution images","well-organized patch database","image super-resolution reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel example-based super-resolution method to hallucinate high-resolution images from low-resolution images.

In our algorithm, a classification process is firstly employed to construct a well-organized patch database. Then, the KPCA prior model is used for each class to infer the high-resolution output. Since the training samples or patches are divided into numerous classes, the variations among the patches in each class or cluster are therefore greatly reduced. In addition, KPCA can capture the high-order statistics in those training samples, which makes the learning process even more powerful.

The study is based on the premise that the deployment of nanorobots and used for investigating within human body. The spatially distributed nanorobots collect information about the target environment by moving throughout the body. Such investigation within human body might face many challenges since nanorobots need to be decentrally controlled and algorithms need to work in lack of global information and constrained environment. This paper proposes to use particle swarm optimization as a feasible approach for self organized movement control of nanorobots. Along with the self organized behavior, coverage is also considered to achieve the complete monitoring throughout the investigation.

The experiments demonstrate that the new model can get better performance than any of the single MPE and MMIE trained models.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724593/4724594/04724641.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2008.128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2008.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Discriminative Model Combination in Speech Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Maximum likelihood estimation","Training data","Computational intelligence","Computer errors","Error correction","Security","Laboratories","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative model","speech recognition","acoustic model training","model combination","cluster method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["model combination","MPE","MMIE","speech training"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Method for Discriminative Model Combination in Speech Recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4724641/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10438709","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method for Discriminative Model Combination in Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3508a200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081323S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724593","isNumber":"4724594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724593","xplore-issue":"4724594","articleId":"4724641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4724661,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-mei Zheng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Electronic & Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai-mei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37595152400"},{"name":"Xu Qian","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Electronic & Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Qian","id":"37398059700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724661","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data encapsulation","Wavelet transforms","Watermarking","Electrocardiography","Spline","Wavelet coefficients","Frequency","Distortion","Biometrics","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","electrocardiography","Haar transforms","medical signal processing","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversible data hiding","electrocardiogram signal","wavelet transforms","reversible watermarking","high data hiding capacity","QRS complex waves","wavelet coefficients selection","Harr wavelet transform","lifting scheme","embedded watermark","ECG signal distortion","embedding capacity"]}],"abstract":"A reversible watermarking algorithm with high data-hiding capacity has been developed for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal based on wavelet transforms. In electrocardiogram signal, the energy is concentrated in QRS complex waves. So the selection of wavelet coefficients for hiding should avoid making QRS complex waves distort obviously. The algorithm hides bits in the expansion of selected coefficients of high frequency sub-band of Harr wavelet transform based on lifting scheme. Due to a slightly modification on non QRS complex waves, the imperceptibility of the embedded watermark in the ECG signal is well guaranteed. The performance has been evaluated in terms of ECG signal distortion and embedding capacity.

The main idea is to improve the performance of traditional BP decoding algorithm by efficiently using the belief of variable nodes passing to check nodes. By considering the belief as genes, the proposed algorithms mainly employ the mutation operation in GA, and change the genes\u00bf amplitudes (either increase or decrease) when updating the check nodes\u00bf information. First, we explore that the marriage of the GA and BP decoding algorithm is reasonable. Three algorithms are proposed accordingly. Proposed algorithm I mutates chosen genes by amplitude enhancement, while proposed algorithm II by amplitude reduction. Finally, proposed algorithm III is a mixture of the former two. From computer simulation results, we show that for short and middle length LDPC codes, our proposed algorithms can improve both BER (bit error rate) and FER (frame error rate) performance over traditional BP decoding algorithm, with slight modification of traditional BP decoding algorithm and little increase of computation complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724593/4724594/04724676.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"375","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2008.169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2008.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified BP Decoding Algorithms Combined with GA for Low-Density Parity Check Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Genetic algorithms","Bit error rate","Wireless sensor networks","Digital video broadcasting","Sparse matrices","Technology planning","Computational intelligence","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","decoding","error statistics","genetic algorithms","parity check codes","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified BP decoding algorithms","GA","low-density parity check codes","belief-propagation","genetic algorithm","variable nodes passing","amplitude enhancement","amplitude reduction","LDPC codes","BER","FER","bit error rate","frame error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","Belief-propagation (BP) decoding algorithm","Genetic Algorithm (GA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modified BP Decoding Algorithms Combined with GA for Low-Density Parity Check Codes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4724676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10438744","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified BP Decoding Algorithms Combined with GA for Low-Density Parity Check Codes","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3508a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060531S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724593","isNumber":"4724594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724593","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4724594","articleId":"4724676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4724677,"authors":[{"name":"Man Teng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electron. & Commun.

This can cause difficulties in regions where pattern data overlap. To overcome this drawback, a fuzzy k-NN was proposed for increasing classification correct rate of overlapping pattern data.

In this scheme, watermark was embedded through adjusting the absolute average value of wavelet transforming low frequency sub-bands in every three audio frames, each of which consists of N audio samples. Similarly watermark is attracted by estimating the relation among the absolute average value of wavelet transforming low frequency sub-bands in every three audio frames.

The RS reduction could erase redundant characters and this makes it possible to take many influential factors of power load into account, although the learning ability of neural network is limited. Furthermore, WNN is brought forward to improve the efficiency of neural network in load forecasting. The mid-layer of WNN adopts Morlet wavelet and this makes it has a good convergence rate than traditional radial basis function (RBF) neural network. At the same time, because of spending less time in simulating the historical training data, the generalization capability of WNN is of good performance, too. The experimental results show that the method developed in this paper suits STLF and the forecasting result is satisfactory.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2008.192","startPage":"446","endPage":"450","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724593/4724715/04724816.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2008.192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on Rough Set and Wavelet Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Neural networks","Economic forecasting","Power generation economics","Training data","Energy management","Statistics","Linear regression","Data mining","Weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","rough set theory","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term load forecasting","rough set reduction","wavelet neural network","Morlet wavelet transform","radial basis function neural network","neural network learning","neural network generalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["load forecasting","rough set","wavelet neural network","learning rate","generalization capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on Rough Set and Wavelet Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4724816/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10438874","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Based on Rough Set and Wavelet Neural Network","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3508b446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046825S","chronDate":"13-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724593","isNumber":"4724715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724593","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4724715","articleId":"4724816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4724825,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Laboratory, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37657519500"},{"name":"Xin Zheng","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Laboratory, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37593131100"},{"name":"Qian Yin","affiliation":["Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Laboratory, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yin","id":"37649931300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3508-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724825","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"By taking advantage of 3 attributes of integer wavelet transform (IWT): efficient computing, multi-resolution and partially reconstruction, we propose one lossless large scale terrain compression method with high compression rate in this paper.

Specifically, we describe a system that takes .NET assembly language with suitable custom attributes as input and produces Verilog output which is mapped to FPGAs. We can then choose to apply analysis and verification techniques to either the highlevel representation in C# or other .NET languages or to the generated RTL netlists. A distinctive aspect of our approach is the exploitation of existing language constructs for concurrent programming and synchronization which contrasts with other schemes which introduce specialized concurrency control constructs to extend a sequential language.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438919","htmlLink":"/document/4724884/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Kiwi: Synthesis of FPGA Circuits from Parallel Programs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kiwi: Synthesis of FPGA Circuits from Parallel Programs","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046526S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4724887,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Le","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hoang","lastName":"Le","id":"37405557600"},{"name":"Weirong Jiang","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Weirong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37288835900"},{"name":"Viktor K.

Pipelining can dramatically improve the search throughput. However, it results in unbalanced memory allocation over the pipeline stages. This has been identified as a major challenge for pipelined solutions. In this paper, an IP lookup rate of 325 MLPS (millions lookups per second) is achieved using a novel SRAM-based bidirectional optimized linear pipeline architecture on Field Programmable Gate Array, named BiOLP, for tree-based search engines in IP routers. BiOLP can also achieve a perfectly balanced memory distribution over the pipeline stages. Moreover, by employing caching to exploit the Internet traffic locality, BiOLP can achieve a high throughput of up to 1.3 GLPS (billion lookups per second). It also maintains packet input order, and supports route updates without blocking subsequent incoming packets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A SRAM-based Architecture for Trie-based IP Lookup Using FPGA","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724887.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A SRAM-based Architecture for Trie-based IP Lookup Using FPGA","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724887/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438922","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A SRAM-based Architecture for Trie-based IP Lookup Using FPGA","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072858S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724888,"authors":[{"name":"Gajanan S.

Packet classification is the core functionality that demands high throughput in such applications. This paper proposes a packet classification architecture to meet such high throughput. We have implemented a Firewall with this architecture in reconflgurable hardware. We propose an extension to Distributed Crossproducting of Field Labels (DCFL) technique to achieve scalable and high performance architecture. The implemented Firewall takes advantage of inherent structure and redundancy of rule set by using our DCFL Extended (DCFLE) algorithm. The use of DCFLE algorithm results in both speed and area improvement when it is implemented in hardware. Although we restrict ourselves to standard 5-tuple matching, the architecture supports additional fields. High throughput classification invariably uses Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) for prefix matching, though TCAM fares poorly in terms of area and power efficiency. Use of TCAM for port range matching is expensive, as the range to prefix conversion results in large number of prefixes leading to storage inefficiency. Extended TCAM (ETCAM) is fast and the most storage efficient solution for range matching. We present for the first time a reconfigurable hardware implementation of ETCAM. We have implemented our Firewall as an embedded system on Virtex-II Pro FPGA based platform, running Linux with the packet classification in hardware. The Firewall was tested in real time with 1 Gbps Ethernet link and 128 sample rules. The packet classification hardware uses a quarter of logic resources and slightly over one third of memory resources of XC2VP30 FPGA. It achieves a maximum classification throughput of 50 million packet/s corresponding to 16 Gbps link rate for the worst case packet size. The Firewall rule update involves only memory re-initialization in software without any hardware change.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.31","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724888.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable High Throughput Firewall in FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724888/","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable High Throughput Firewall in FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724888/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438923","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable High Throughput Firewall in FPGA","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047207S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4724889,"authors":[{"name":"Antonis Nikitakis","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Antonis","lastName":"Nikitakis","id":"37662178400"},{"name":"Loannis Papaefstathiou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Loannis","lastName":"Papaefstathiou","id":"37269342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724889","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":391},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Matched filters","Hardware","Computer networks","Next generation networking","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Costs","Quality of service","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","field programmable gate arrays","information filters","reconfigurable architectures","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory-efficient FPGA-based classification engine","packet classification scheme","multidimensional classification algorithms","reconfigurable hardware","dual stage bloom filter classification engine","2sBFCE","5-field search scheme","multifield classification rules","multilevel bloom filters","FPGA implementation","bit rate 2 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Packet classification","QoS","Reconfigurable computing"]}],"abstract":"Packet classification is one of the most important enabling technologies for next generation network services.

In order to avoid the overheads incurred by a bus system or network-on-chip, the approach we have taken is to create point-to-point wiring harnesses to support the dynamic intermodule communications. These harnesses are reconfigured at various stages in the application as necessary. The COMMA methodology implements applications on tile-reconfigurable FPGAs such as the Virtex-4. This paper outlines the methodology and describes greedy and dynamic programming-based algorithms for merging configurations, which is a central process in generating wiring harnesses within the methodology. The effects of merging the configuration graphs were explored with both algorithms for a range of device sizes and architectural parameters. Our evaluation indicates graph merging using the greedy method can reduce reconfiguration delay by up to 60% and the dynamic programming algorithm can achieve a further 50% reduction in reconfiguration delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effectiveness of Configuration Merging in Point-to-Point Networks for Module-based FPGA Reconfiguration","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.25","startPage":"65","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724890.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Effectiveness of Configuration Merging in Point-to-Point Networks for Module-based FPGA Reconfiguration","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724890/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438925","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effectiveness of Configuration Merging in Point-to-Point Networks for Module-based FPGA Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075745S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724893,"authors":[{"name":"Saar Drimer","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Saar","lastName":"Drimer","id":"37546458700"},{"name":"Tim G\u00fcneysu","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"G\u00fcneysu","id":"37662108000"},{"name":"Christof Paar","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christof","lastName":"Paar","id":"37282655400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724893","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724893","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Logic","Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Throughput","Hardware","Embedded computing","Laboratories","Computer security","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","flip-flops","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA","clock cycle","logic elements","flip-flops","cipher implementations","BlockRAM","DSP","bit rate 1.76 Gbit/s","bit rate 6.21 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","DSP units","FPGA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.42","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724893.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSPs, BRAMs and a Pinch of Logic: New Recipes for AES on FPGAs","abstract":"We present an AES cipher implementation that is based on the BlockRAM and DSP units embedded within Xilinx's Virtex-5 FPGAs.

We present an implementation of a map-reduce library supporting parallel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Parallelisation due to pipelining, multiple data paths and concurrent execution of FPGA/GPU hardware is automatically achieved. Users first specify the map and reduce steps for the problem in ANSI Cand no knowledge of the underlying hardware or parallelisation is needed. The source code is then manually translated into a pipelined data path which, along with the map-reduce library, is compiled into appropriate binary configurations for the processing units.

The co-processor allows this relatively complex computational task to be performed using less hardware and less power than would be required by a microprocessor-based computing cluster with comparable throughput and accuracy. The architecture exploits parallelism of the SART algorithm at many levels in order to efficiently map it into the FPGA platform. The system has been developed in VHDL, and implemented on a Virtex-4 SX55 FPGA. Compared to a Pentium 4 CPU running at 3 GHz, use of the co-processor system provides a speed-up of about 6 times for the current signal matrix size of 128-by-16. Greater speed-ups will be obtained when larger matrices are processed because the co-processor reduces the complexity of a m-by-n SVD from O(mn\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), to O(mn). Even larger speed-ups may be obtained by using multiple devices in parallel. The system is capable of computing the SART metric to an accuracy of about -145 dB (0.2 ppm) with respect to its true value. This level of accuracy, which is better than that obtained using single precision floating point arithmetic, allows even relatively weak signals to make a meaningful contribution to the final SART solution.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.35","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724899.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Co-processor for Singular Value Array Reconciliation Tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724899/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Co-processor for Singular Value Array Reconciliation Tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438934","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724899/","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Co-processor for Singular Value Array Reconciliation Tomography","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067348S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4724900,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Chase","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Chase","id":"37276553300"},{"name":"Brent Nelson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37291594100"},{"name":"John Bodily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bodily","id":"37662105300"},{"name":"Zhaoyi Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Zhaoyi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37287897900"},{"name":"Dah-Jye Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Dah-Jye","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280603200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724900","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":894},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image motion analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Optical computing","High speed optical techniques","Computer architecture","Computer vision","Data flow computing","Parallel processing","Arithmetic","Multicore processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","MIMO systems","optical computing","program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA devices","statically-scheduled control","multicore processors","graphical processing units","computing architectures","tensor-based optical flow algorithm","MIMO digital communication system design"]}],"abstract":"FPGA devices have often found use as higher-performance alternatives to programmable processors for implementing a variety of computations. Applications successfully implemented on FPGAs have typically contained high levels of parallelism and have often used simple statically-scheduled control and modest arithmetic. Recently introduced computing devices such as coarse grain reconfigurable arrays, multi-core processors, and graphical processing units (GPUs) promise to significantly change the computational landscape for the implementation of high-speed real-time computing tasks. One reason for this is that these architectures take advantage of many of the same application characteristics that fit well on FPGAs. One real-time computing task, optical flow, is difficult to apply in robotic vision applications in practice because of its high computational and data rate requirements, and so is a good candidate for implementation on FPGAs and other custom computing architectures. In this paper, a tensor-based optical flow algorithm is implemented on both an FPGA and a GPU and the two implementations discussed. The two implementations had similar performance, but with the FPGA implementation requiring 12\u00d7 more development time. Other comparison data for these two technologies is then given for three additional applications taken from a MIMO digital communication system design, providing additional examples of the relative capabilities of these two technologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Optical Flow Calculations on FPGA and GPU Architectures: A Comparison Study","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.24","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724900.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Optical Flow Calculations on FPGA and GPU Architectures: A Comparison Study","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724900/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438935","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Optical Flow Calculations on FPGA and GPU Architectures: A Comparison Study","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06578S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4724901,"authors":[{"name":"Omkar Dandekar","affiliation":["Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA","Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Omkar","lastName":"Dandekar","id":"37398990600"},{"name":"William Plishker","affiliation":["University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Plishker","id":"37265335200"},{"name":"Shuvra Bhattacharyya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Shuvra","lastName":"Bhattacharyya","id":"37276941700"},{"name":"Raj Shekhar","affiliation":["University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, US"],"firstName":"Raj","lastName":"Shekhar","id":"37270717100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724901","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Image registration","Signal processing algorithms","Technological innovation","Image processing","Biomedical image processing","Hardware","Process design","Design optimization","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","evolutionary computation","field programmable gate arrays","image registration","medical image processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","FPGA-based medical image registration","image processing","hardware implementation","design complexity","tradeoff curves","field-programmable gate array","evolutionary algorithm-based search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective Optimization","Image Registration","FPGA","Evolutionary Algorithms"]}],"abstract":"With a multitude of technological innovations, one emerging trend in image processing, and medical image processing, in particular, is custom hardware implementation of computationally intensive algorithms in the quest to achieve real-time performance. For reasons of area-efficiency and performance, these implementations often employ limited-precision datapaths. Identifying effective wordlengths for these datapaths while accounting for tradeoffs between design complexity and accuracy is a critical and time consuming aspect of this design process. Having access to optimized tradeoff curves can equip designers to adapt their designs to different performance requirements and target specific devices while reducing design time. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization strategy developed in the context of field-programmable gate array-based implementation of medical image registration. Within this framework, we compare several search methods and demonstrate the applicability of an evolutionary algorithm-based search for efficiently identifying superior multiobjective tradeoff curves. This strategy can easily be adapted to a wide range of signal processing applications, including areas of image and video processing beyond the medical domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of FPGA-Based Medical Image Registration","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.50","startPage":"183","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724901.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of FPGA-Based Medical Image Registration","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4724901/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438936","conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of FPGA-Based Medical Image Registration","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063893S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4724903,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Butts","affiliation":["Ambric, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Butts","id":"37355066700"},{"name":"Brad Budlong","affiliation":["Ambric, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Budlong","id":"37662142300"},{"name":"Paul Wasson","affiliation":["Ambric, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Wasson","id":"37662141700"},{"name":"Ed White","affiliation":["Ambric, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Ed","lastName":"White","id":"37658466100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724903","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic programming","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Parallel programming","Reduced instruction set computing","Application software","Streaming media","Video compression","Graphics","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented programming","parallel programming","reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massively parallel processing array platform","reconfigurable computing","structural object programming model","software programs","32-bit RISC processors","data exchange","self-synchronizing channels","IDE","statically configured work farms","video compression","video decompression","network processing","graphics applications","dynamic runtime self-reconfiguration","FPGA reconfiguration speed","file size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reconfiguration","runtime reconfiguration","reconfigurable computing","massively parallel computing","programming model","embedded computing"]}],"abstract":"A massively parallel processing array platform for reconfigurable computing is based on a structural object programming model. Objects are software programs running concurrently on hundreds of 32-bit RISC processors and memories. They exchange data and control through a structure of self-synchronizing channels. An IDE compiles source code and block diagrams into a configuration file in less than one minute. A common application design pattern on this platform, called a work farm, is a parallel set of worker objects, with one input and one output stream. Statically configured work farms with homogeneous and heterogeneous sets of workers have been used in video compression and decompression, network processing, and graphics applications. This work extends the programming model into dynamic runtime self-reconfiguration. First a general technique for dynamic objects that retain a static internal structure is developed, then it is extended to dynamic objects with dynamic structures. Reconfiguration speed and file size is orders of magnitude better than FPGA reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.6","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","startPage":"206","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Work Farms on a Massively Parallel Processor Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Work Farms on a Massively Parallel Processor Array","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724903/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438938","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724903/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Work Farms on a Massively Parallel Processor Array","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066197S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724904,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Papadopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECED), Technical University of Crete, China"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Papadopoulos","id":"37318694300"},{"name":"Ioannis Papaefstathiou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECED), Technical University of Crete, China"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papaefstathiou","id":"37269342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724904","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"Data compression techniques can alleviate low bandwidth problems in multigigabit networks and are especially useful when combined with encryption.

Such models are most easily described as Monte-Carlo simulations, but take too long to converge in software based simulators. This paper describes a hardware implementation of a loan portfolio simulator, which uses an event based model to describe changes both in prevailing economic conditions, and the behaviour of individual loans within the portfolio. Three distinct variants of the simulator are developed using transformations of the simulation algorithm, with each variant trading off area utilisation against the efficiency with which different event types can be processed. As the distribution of event types is highly dependent on the input data, each of the three variants provides the highest overall performance per FPGA for some set of input data characteristics. The hardware simulators are implemented using a Virtex-4 xc4vsx55 device running at 233 MHz in an RC2000 PCI card, and compared to four parallel software simulation threads running in a quad-core Pentium-4 Core2 at 2.4 GHz, providing a speed-up of between 60 and 100 times.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.41","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","startPage":"229","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credit Risk Modelling using Hardware Accelerated Monte-Carlo Simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Credit Risk Modelling using Hardware Accelerated Monte-Carlo Simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724905/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438940","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724905/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Credit Risk Modelling using Hardware Accelerated Monte-Carlo Simulation","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097791S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4724907,"authors":[{"name":"Martin C.

Although DMD improves performance by several orders of magnitude, it is still compute bound. In previous work, we found that FPGAs are extremely well suited to accelerating DMD, with speed-ups of 200\u00d7 to 400\u00d7 being achieved. Large models, however, are problematic because they require that most predicted events be stored in off-chip memory, rather than on the FPGA. Here we present a solution that allows the priority queue to be extended seamlessly into off-chip memory, resulting in a throughput equal to the hardware-only priority queue, or about 30\u00d7 faster than the best software-only algorithm. The solution is based on the observation that--when an event is predicted to occur far in the future--not only can its processing be imprecise, but the time when the processing itself occurs can also be substantially delayed. This allows numerous optimizations and restructurings. We demonstrate the resulting design on standard hardware and present the experimental results used to tune the data structures.","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724907.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient O(1) Priority Queue for Large FPGA-Based Discrete Event Simulations of Molecular Dynamics","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.49","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient O(1) Priority Queue for Large FPGA-Based Discrete Event Simulations of Molecular Dynamics","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724907/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient O(1) Priority Queue for Large FPGA-Based Discrete Event Simulations of Molecular Dynamics","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076532S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724913,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios-Grigorios Mplemenos","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios-Grigorios","lastName":"Mplemenos","id":"37404067800"},{"name":"Ioannis Papaefstathiou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Papaefstathiou","id":"37269342000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724913","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Multiprocessing systems","Embedded system","Embedded computing","High performance computing","Silicon","Engines","DNA","Sequences","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based multiprocessor system","MPLEM","multiprocessor embedded system","complex memory system","heterogeneous interconnection scheme","BLAST CPU-intensive application","DNA sequence matching","database search"]}],"abstract":"Multiprocessor embedded systems (MESes) are a very promising approach for high performance yet relatively low-cost computing.

This has become a bottleneck towards the next-generation FPGAs of even larger logic capacity. To relieve this problem, the idea of using FPGA interconnects in a time-multiplexed way has been previously proposed. But to the best of authors' knowledge, no realization of such an architecture and its design flow has been reported before. In this paper, we develop a novel time-multiplexed FPGA interconnect architecture and its global routing algorithm TMRouter. TMRouter is based on the negotiated congestion delay algorithm. It analyzes whether congestion can be solved by time-sharing a wire segment for several nets in a congested channel. Experiments show that, for 16 MCNC benchmark circuits, their minimum channel widths and critical path delays achieved by the TMRouter are 37.50% - 57.89% and 11.90% in average less than those of the VPR router, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/FCCM.2008.28","publicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 16th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724876/4724877/04724914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCCM.2008.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724877","startPage":"275","endPage":"276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Area-Efficient Timing-Driven Routing Algorithm for Scalable FPGAs with Time-Multiplexed Interconnects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Area-Efficient Timing-Driven Routing Algorithm for Scalable FPGAs with Time-Multiplexed Interconnects","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724914/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"10438949","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Area-Efficient Timing-Driven Routing Algorithm for Scalable FPGAs with Time-Multiplexed Interconnects","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3307a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047246S","chronDate":"14-15 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724876","isNumber":"4724877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724876","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4724877","articleId":"4724914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724916,"authors":[{"name":"Miad Faezipour","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Miad","lastName":"Faezipour","id":"37296205600"},{"name":"Mehrdad Nourani","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Circuits & Systems, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"37273839500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3307-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4724916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"This paper introduces a new basic building block based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) hardware implementation to support complex constraint repetitions in regular expressions.

The reward probabilities of each arm are unknown, and thus one must balance between exploiting existing knowledge about the arms, and obtaining new information. In the last decades, several computationally efficient algorithms for tackling this problem have emerged, with learning automata (LA) being known for their \u00bf-optimality, and confidence interval based for logarithmically growing regret. Applications include treatment selection in clinical trials, route selection in adaptive routing, and plan exploration in games like Go. The TABB has also been extensively studied from a Bayesian perspective, however, in general, such analysis leads to computationally inefficient solution policies. This paper introduces the Bayesian learning automaton (BLA). The BLA is inherently Bayesian in nature, yet relies simply on counting rewards/penalties and on random sampling from a pair of twin beta distributions. Furthermore, we report that BLA is self-correcting and converges to only pulling the optimal arm with probability 1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to most LA, BLA does not rely on external learning speed/accuracy control. It also outperforms recently proposed confidence interval based algorithms. We thus believe that BLA opens up for improved performance in a number of applications,and that it forms the basis for a new avenue of research.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2008.67","publicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724937/4724938/04724951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724938","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian Learning Automaton for Solving Two-Armed Bernoulli Bandit Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4724951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Learning Automaton for Solving Two-Armed Bernoulli Bandit Problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4724951/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10437615","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4724951/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Learning Automaton for Solving Two-Armed Bernoulli Bandit Problems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3495a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048564S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724937","isNumber":"4724938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724937","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4724938","articleId":"4724951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4724991,"authors":[{"name":"Hang T.

The technique proposed in this paper, facilitates torso surface assessment and it consists of three stages of digitizing, parameterizing and mapping. Self-organizing neural networks (SNN) is used to parameterize the torso malformation. The orientation and position of the neuron in the SNN provides detailed insight regarding significant changes in the torso model.

Accurate segmentation is difficult especially for complicated patterns such as lesions overlapping or touching normal structures, low-contrast lesions, and subtle opacities. With standard segmentation methods, normal structures overlapping or touching lesions are often erroneously included in segmented regions. In addition, normal structures are often segmented erroneously as lesions. Thus, improving the specificity of segmentation methods is very important in the development of a CAD scheme. Our purpose in this study was to develop a supervised lesion segmentation method based on a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) filter in a CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules in CT. The MTANN filter was trained with actual nodules in CT images to segment nodules with improved specificity. With the MTANN-based segmentation method, the specificity of the segmentation was improved; thus, the overall performance of our CAD scheme was improved substantially.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4725023/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10437643","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4725023/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Lesions with Improved Specificity in Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using a Massive-Training Artificial Neural Network (MTANN)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Lesions with Improved Specificity in Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using a Massive-Training Artificial Neural Network (MTANN)","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3495a523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055054S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724937","isNumber":"4724938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724937","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4724938","articleId":"4725023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4725030,"authors":[{"name":"Scott F.

The cumulative hazards curve for the neural network model was much closer to the empirical curve in the test data than the one produced by the Cox model. The neural network model showed equal performance to Cox's model in terms of discrimination. However, the neural network model was better than Cox's model in terms of calibration.

While several papers have been published in the literature on speech emotion recognition, the features used are taken or modified from those used for speech recognition purposes. However, not all features used for speech recognition are of equal importance for emotion recognition. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a systematic method on feature selection for emotion recognition from speech signals. The idea is to work on a well-selected small feature set and use it to remove irrelevant information. Specifically, the proposed method uses the similar idea of the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to estimate the linear relationship between the various features and the emotional states. The outcome is a set of features that are of most relevance to the emotions. Experiments have been conducted using the LDC database and with the use of the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) as the classification method. The results obtained show that, comparable accuracies can be obtained for the emotional states tested with the use of only about 30% of the features considered. This implies that the computational load can be reduced greatly too.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2008.85","pdfPath":"/iel5/4724937/4724938/04725081.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"862","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4724938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Probabilistic Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4725081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Probabilistic Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10437678","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4725081/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Emotion Recognition Using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Probabilistic Neural Network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3495a859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041153S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4724937","isNumber":"4724938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4724937","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4724938","articleId":"4725081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4725089,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Guan","affiliation":["Electric Power College, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Guan","id":"37287986600"},{"name":"Tong-wen Wang","affiliation":["Electric Power College, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tong-wen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37654792900"},{"name":"Yao Zhang","affiliation":["Electric Power College, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292447500"},{"name":"Li-jun Zhang","affiliation":["Electric Power College, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li-jun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37656431200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3495-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4725089","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4725089","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge acquisition","Power system dynamics","Power system stability","Clustering algorithms","Decision trees","Machine learning","Data mining","Kernel","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","power system analysis computing","power system dynamic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system dynamic stability assessment","data driven knowledge acquisition method","data driven knowledge extraction scheme","pattern discovery","IEEE test system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel data driven knowledge extraction scheme is proposed and applied to realize power system stability estimation since power system stability assessment can be treated as a typical classification problem (stable/unstable).

The simulation results show that the approach for the multi-class LS-WSVM classifiers is effective, that can obtain the optimal parameters of LS-WSVM with global searching QPSO, and improved LS-WSVM provides excellent precision for classification.","doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2008.93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCID.2008.93","startPage":"278","endPage":"281","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4725435/4725536/04725608.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Class Wavelet SVM Classifiers Using Quantum Particles Swarm Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Class Wavelet SVM Classifiers Using Quantum Particles Swarm Optimization Algorithm","conferenceDate":"17-18 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4725608/","accessionNumber":"10451135","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4725608/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Class Wavelet SVM Classifiers Using Quantum Particles Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3311a278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065041S","chronDate":"17-18 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4725435","isNumber":"4725536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4725435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4725536","articleId":"4725608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4725613,"authors":[{"name":"Xueping Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xueping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970700"},{"name":"Yixun Liu","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yixun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655750200"},{"name":"Jiayao Wang","affiliation":["School of Surveying & Mapping, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiayao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292906300"},{"name":"Gaofeng Deng","affiliation":["School of Surveying & Mapping, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Deng","id":"37573587900"},{"name":"Chuang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Surveying & Mapping, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652092800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3311-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4725613","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Equations","Data engineering","Design engineering","Data mining","Quantization","Computational intelligence","Computer science","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm mutation","spatial clustering","obstacles constraint","spatial data mining","K-Medoids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4725613","abstract":"Spatial clustering with obstacles constraints (SCOC) has been a new topic in spatial data mining (SDM).

This design considers the combination of queuing and channel state information (CSI) which provides QoS support for multimedia applications in UWB. For the physical layer, the use of a linear precoded orthogonal division multiplexing (LP-OFDM) waveform is proposed because of its significant performance increase compared to the WiMedia proposal. For the medium access control layer, scheduling is performed in order to differentiate between the different users and to satisfy their quality of service constraints. This cross-layer approach optimizes the system spectral efficiency and solves the problem in the WiMedia solution of cohabitation of more than three users sharing the three sub-bands of the same channel. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme leads to a considerable improvement in resource allocation and can guarantee the required quality of service.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726007","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726007.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user cross-layer allocation design for LP-OFDM high data rate UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726007/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user cross-layer allocation design for LP-OFDM high data rate UWB systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439193","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726007/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user cross-layer allocation design for LP-OFDM high data rate UWB systems","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06494S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4726008,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Liu","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTHAachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"lastName":"Chunhui Liu","id":"37406604900"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTHAachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726008","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM modulation","Feedback","Delay estimation","Degradation","Rayleigh channels","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit loading","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel uncertainty","channel state information","CSI error","time-varying channel","noisy channel","soft channel estimation","Cramer-Rao bound","noniterative algorithm","optimal quantization"]}],"abstract":"In practice only imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter due to noisy and time-varying channel.

Assuming the knowledge of delay-related information, we propose an iterative algorithm for joint multi-path Rayleigh channel complex gains and data recovery in fast fading environments. Each complex gain time-variation, within one OFDM symbol, is approximated by a polynomial representation. Based on the Jakes process, an auto-regressive (AR) model of the polynomial coefficients dynamics is built, making it possible to employ the Kalman filter estimator for the polynomial coefficients. Hence, the channel matrix is easily computed, and the data symbol is estimated with free inter-sub-carrier-interference (ICI) thanks to the use of a QR-decomposition of the channel matrix. Our claims are supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results, which are obtained considering Jakes\u00bf channels with high Doppler spreads.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726011","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726011.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM high speed channel complex gains estimation using Kalman filter and QR-detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726011/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM high speed channel complex gains estimation using Kalman filter and QR-detector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439197","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726011/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM high speed channel complex gains estimation using Kalman filter and QR-detector","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112307S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4726012,"authors":[{"name":"Teresa Araujo","affiliation":["ISR-IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Araujo","id":"37283724100"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["ISR-IST, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726012","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Nonlinear distortion","Downlink","OFDM modulation","Frequency conversion","Spectral analysis","Interference","Fluctuations","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio links","radiofrequency interference","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear distortion effects","OFDMA signal","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","downlink transmission","analytical spectral characterization","nonlinear interference level"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider the evaluation of nonlinear distortion effects on the downlink transmission of systems employing OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) signals.

It arises from carrier frequency offsets (CFO), from the Doppler spread due to channel time-variation, and, to a lesser extent, from sampling frequency offsets (SFO). The literature reports several models of ICI due to each kind of impairment. Some studies describe ICI due to two of the three impairments, but so far no general model exists to describe the joint effect of all three impairments together. Furthermore, most available models involve some level of approximation, and the diversity of approaches makes it cumbersome to compare power levels of the different kinds of ICI. In this work, we present the derivation of a general and mathematically exact model for the ICI stemming from the joint effect of the three impairments mentioned.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726013","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726013.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intercarrier Interference in OFDM: A deterministic model for transmissions in mobile environments with imperfect synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726013/","displayDocTitle":"Intercarrier Interference in OFDM: A deterministic model for transmissions in mobile environments with imperfect synchronization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439199","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726013/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intercarrier Interference in OFDM: A deterministic model for transmissions in mobile environments with imperfect synchronization","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074518S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4726014,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Ribeiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es / Universidade de Aveiro, Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal","Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Leiria, Leiria, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37648684200"},{"name":"Atilio Gameiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es / Universidade de Aveiro, Campo Universit\u00e1rio, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Atilio","lastName":"Gameiro","id":"37270506000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726014","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Multipath channels","Frequency estimation","Time domain analysis","Cost function","Channel estimation","Computational modeling","Baseband","Bit error rate","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","symbol structure","carrier frequency offset","time-domain properties","channel estimation","broadband wireless channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we revisit the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and removal for broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We propose an algorithm that explores the time-domain (TD) properties of transmitted symbols carrying pilots and data. A careful examination of the components that constitute the TD received symbols leads to the definition of a simple, yet effective, cost function. In a real scenario, the cost function presents a bowl shape with a single global minimum easily identifiable (no local minima). The proposed method is independent of the channel estimation and decision, presenting a very low computational load. The feasibility of the investigated method is substantiated by system simulation using BRAN-A broadband wireless channel model. Simulation results show that the impact of the residual CFO in the system\u00bfs performance is minimal.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726014","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726014.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating CFO in OFDM systems by exploring the symbol structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726014/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating CFO in OFDM systems by exploring the symbol structure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726014/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating CFO in OFDM systems by exploring the symbol structure","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054219S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4726015,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Biagi","affiliation":["INFO COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Biagi","id":"37275283000"},{"name":"Enzo Baccarelli","affiliation":["INFO COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Enzo","lastName":"Baccarelli","id":"37275301600"},{"name":"Nicola Cordeschi","affiliation":["INFO COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Cordeschi","id":"37297940500"},{"name":"Cristian Pelizzoni","affiliation":["INFO COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Pelizzoni","id":"37275280700"},{"name":"Valentina Polli","affiliation":["INFO COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Polli","id":"37392117100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726015","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"abstract":"Main goal of this work is to give insight on the possible performance improvement arising in the wireless local ad-hoc access from the synergic cooperation of two emerging paradigms, multi-antenna and cognitive radios. The target is the competitive maximization of each access rate in presence of multiple-access interference (MAI) induced by the other accessing terminals. Being the radios cognitive, they are capable to autonomously learn the ambient-context and, then, self-configure their access strategy via suitable power-allocation, that is, time-frequency-code-space signal-shaping. Furthermore, a generalized approach is developed to allow the node to access with a (possibly hybrid) scheme to the medium by combining different x-DMA strategies under QoS-guaranteed access policy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726015.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collision erasure and generalized access in MIMO cognitive ad-hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Ad hoc networks","Multiple access interference","Cognitive radio","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","RF signals","Fading","Bandwidth","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","antenna arrays","channel estimation","cognitive radio","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","quality of service","radio access networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless local ad-hoc access network","multiantenna system","cognitive radio","multiple-access interference","MAI","power-allocation","time-frequency-code-space signal-shaping","QoS-guaranteed access policy","x-DMA strategy","MIMO","collision erasure","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Collision erasure and generalized access in MIMO cognitive ad-hoc networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439201","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision erasure and generalized access in MIMO cognitive ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065819S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4726021,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos Antonio Neves","affiliation":["CPGEI, Federal Technological University of Paran\u00e1 (UTFPR), Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcos Antonio","lastName":"Neves","id":"38254415100"},{"name":"Richard Demo Souza","affiliation":["CPGEI, Federal Technological University of Paran\u00e1 (UTFPR), Curitiba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Richard Demo","lastName":"Souza","id":"37275937500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726021","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Repeaters","Base stations","Interference","Cellular networks","Equations","Directive antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","interference (signal)","telecommunication traffic","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA cellular repeater","donor base station","thermal noise","mobile stations","traffic capacity loss","interference measurements"]}],"abstract":"The low cost of CDMA cellular repeaters suggests that its use may be always advantageous.

We formulate service requests initiated by the applications running on the mobile device as a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem: optimal mapping of application requirements to wireless interface while minimizing the monetary cost and maximizing the satisfaction with respect to QoS metrics. This problem is then solved for three different access scenarios using an exhaustive search algorithm and the NSGA-II MOO algorithm. Our aim is to demonstrate how MOO works in such a context, nevertheless for real life problems where exhaustive search cannot handle the problem, we expect NSGA-II to be a more appropriate tool. The results obtained by these algorithms are then discussed and their quality is compared to a more traditional cost function based on weighted sum.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726033","startPage":"133","endPage":"137","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726033.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization of service delivery over a heterogeneous wireless access system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726033/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization of service delivery over a heterogeneous wireless access system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726033/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10439219","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization of service delivery over a heterogeneous wireless access system","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063063S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4726044,"authors":[{"name":"Massinissa Lalam","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Massinissa","lastName":"Lalam","id":"37568647600"},{"name":"Raphael Visoz","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Visoz","id":"37268925600"},{"name":"Antoine O.

In the proposed method, a weighted coherent averaging filter suppresses the noise component of the estimated channel gain in the frequency domain and then, after conversion of the channel gain into a time domain signal, effective path selection with threshold detection suppresses the noise component further. Computer simulation results show that the channel estimation with weighted coherent averaging in the frequency domain in addition to path selection employing threshold detection in the time domain improves the block error rate (BLER) by approximately 0.5 dB compared to that with path selection in the time domain only when the transmission bandwidth is one resource block (RB), i.e., 180 kHz, to four RBs, where paths are not sufficiently resolved. We also confirm that frequency domain channel estimation using only the threshold based path selection improves the BLER performance the most in a wide transmission bandwidth such as 25 RBs where sufficient path resolution accuracy is obtained.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726047.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726047","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726047","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726047","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency division multiaccess","Bandwidth","Frequency domain analysis","Equalizers","Frequency estimation","Interference suppression","Radio access networks","MIMO","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-carrier FDMA radio access","variable transmission bandwidth","frequency domain channel estimation","two-step noise suppression method","weighted coherent averaging filter","block error rate","threshold based path selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726047/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of noise suppression in channel estimation for single-carrier FDMA radio access with variable transmission bandwidth","accessionNumber":"10439233","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726047/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of noise suppression in channel estimation for single-carrier FDMA radio access with variable transmission bandwidth","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04864S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4726048,"authors":[{"name":"Moussa Diallo","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Moussa","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37540908000"},{"name":"Laurent Boher","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Boher","id":"37299789200"},{"name":"Rodrigue Rabineau","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Rodrigue","lastName":"Rabineau","id":"37545546000"},{"name":"Laurent Cariou","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Cariou","id":"37299003800"},{"name":"Maryline Helard","affiliation":["Research & Development Division, France Telecom, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269770700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726048","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":375},"abstract":"This paper deals with transform domain channel estimation (TD-CE) in the MIMO-OFDM system when null carriers are placed at the edges of the spectrum in order to assure band isolation from interfering signals that occupy neighboring frequency bands.

They are vital to the design and performance evaluation of error control schemes and high layer wireless communication protocols. Therefore, designing an efficient and accurate generative model is highly desirable. Moreover, the errors encountered in digital wireless channels exhibit correlation among them. This stimulates us to construct a Markovian based generative model with two embedded processes. The first process is dedicated to assembling error bursts with error-free bursts, whereas the second one is devoted to creating individual error bursts employing the maximum gap norm within error bursts. This premise is utilized in this paper to show that the resulting generative model can generate error sequences with desired bit correlations and is capable of statistically matching a descriptive model, derived from an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) transmission system, regardless of the configuration of its error sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726050","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","startPage":"219","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double embedded processes based hidden Markov models for binary digital wireless channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Double embedded processes based hidden Markov models for binary digital wireless channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726050/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439236","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726050/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double embedded processes based hidden Markov models for binary digital wireless channels","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103912S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4726051,"authors":[{"name":"Manuj Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India","Advanced Numerical Research & Analysis Group, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Manuj","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37405455600"},{"name":"Anirudha Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Anirudha","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"37298471300"},{"name":"K.

For successful deployment of these BCC-based WBANs, it is necessary to develop a clear understanding of the channel behavior. Therefore, this paper presents the key characteristics of the capacitively-coupled on-body channel used for BCC. This is based on an experimental study, which was carried out with a specifically designed measurement system. The goal of the study was to reveal the influence of electrode design, electrode position and body motion on the propagation loss and to characterize the experienced interference. It is concluded that the maximum propagation loss for the whole body channel is below 80 dB. Moreover, the frequency dispersion and the influence of body movement on channel attenuation are shown to be much smaller than for radio frequency (RF) WBAN channels. From the results we conclude that BCC can result in a simpler, more robust, and lower-power WBAN than what is achievable with traditional RF solutions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726053.pdf","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental characterization of the body-coupled communications channel","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726053","startPage":"234","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Experimental characterization of the body-coupled communications channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726053/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10439239","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726053/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental characterization of the body-coupled communications channel","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043022S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4726054,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohong Mao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xiaohong Mao","id":"37087594737"},{"name":"Yee Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Yee Hui Lee","id":"37087280541"},{"name":"Boon Chong Ng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Boon Chong Ng","id":"37087534905"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726054","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Urban areas","Delay estimation","Acoustic propagation","Antenna measurements","UHF measurements","Performance evaluation","Receiving antennas","Bandwidth","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","telecommunication channels","UHF antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband channel modelling","UHF band","urban area","sounding measurements","static antennas","power delay","mean delay spread","RMS delay spread","coherence bandwidth"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726054","abstract":"This paper studies the small-scale multipath propagation characteristics of a typical outdoor urban environment.

In this paper, we present an analysis on the convergence of feedforward linearizer coefficients and the resulting reduction of inter-modulation distortion (IMD) when gradient-descent type adaptations are used with a PA that exhibits memory. A Hammerstein model is used for PA modeling, and computer simulations are used to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Convergence","Intermodulation distortion","Computer simulation","Radio transmitters","Peak to average power ratio","Virtual manufacturing","Communications technology","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermodulation distortion","linearisation techniques","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier memory","adaptive feedforward linearizers","implementation inaccuracies","gradient-descent type methods","feedforward structure","intermodulation distortion","Hammerstein model","computer simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726066","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726066.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of power amplifier memory on adaptive feedforward linearizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of power amplifier memory on adaptive feedforward linearizers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726066/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726066/","accessionNumber":"10439252","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of power amplifier memory on adaptive feedforward linearizers","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038319S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4726067,"authors":[{"name":"Henna Paaso","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Henna","lastName":"Paaso","id":"37646059400"},{"name":"Aarne Mammela","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Aarne","lastName":"Mammela","id":"37269630600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726067","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2836},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Mathematical model","Nonlinear systems","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Polynomials","Power system modeling","Intersymbol interference","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","polynomials","power amplifiers","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct learning predistortion architectures","indirect learning predistortion architectures","power amplifiers","communication system","digital predistorters","memory polynomial predistorters","self-tuning control","nonlinear effect analysis","Matlab\u00bf"]}],"abstract":"Power amplifiers in a communication system are inherently nonlinear.

Aiming at maximizing this system performance measure, we then optimize an AMC scheme which directly satisfies a prescribed packet loss rate constraint at the data-link layer. The results indicate that utilizing cooperative ARQ as a retransmission strategy, noticeably enhances the spectral efficiency compared with the system that employs AMC alone at the physical layer. Moreover, the proposed adaptive rate cooperative ARQ scheme outperforms the fixed rate counterpart when the transmission modes at the source and relay are chosen based on the channel statistics. This in turn quantifies the possible gain achieved by joint design of AMC and ARQ in wireless relay networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726069/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439255","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint adaptive modulation-coding and cooperative ARQ for wireless relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint adaptive modulation-coding and cooperative ARQ for wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05116S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4726071,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In the physical layer, local oscillators are disciplined by the global positioning system (GPS) and over the backbone network for outdoor and indoor base stations, respectively. In the medium access control (MAC) layer, the data flow can be synchronized by two approaches. The first approach uses so-called time stamps. The data flow through the user plane and through copies of it in each cooperative base station is synchronized using a timing protocol on the interconnects between the base stations. The second approach adds mapping information to the data after the user plane processing is almost finalized. Each forward-error encoded transport block, its modulation and coding scheme and the resources where it will be transmitted are multicast over the interconnect network. Interconnect latency is reduced below 1 ms to enable coherent interference reduction for mobile radio channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726071","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726071.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of cooperative base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726071/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of cooperative base stations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439257","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726071/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of cooperative base stations","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059036S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4726072,"authors":[{"name":"Trung Q.

The proposed IP-OFDM system exploits the impulse postfix, which consists of a high power impulse sample and several zero samples at the end of a OFDM symbol block, to estimate channel impulse response. As shown in , , the IP-OFDM system can achieve the enhanced bit error rate performance compared to that of conventional OFDM systems, but there is an important Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) issue for deciding the amount of impulse power in the IP-OFDM system. In , a statistic-based method was proposed to determine the amount of impulse power for avoiding the PAPR increase. However, the proposed method does not give meaningful intuition for us how the designed impulse power would affect to the performance of practical IP-OFDM systems. In real systems, there is a nonlinear High Power Amplifier (HPA) that may cause significant performance degradation of IP-OFDM by distorting the impulse postfix. Therefore, we propose decision criteria of the power boosting factor for impulse sample in practical IP-OFDM systems. With the proposed decision criteria, the impulse power is designed based on the characteristics of the nonlinear HPA. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision criteria for IP-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726081","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","startPage":"376","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power boosting factor determination for the impulse sample in Impulse Postfix OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A power boosting factor determination for the impulse sample in Impulse Postfix OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726081/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439267","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726081/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power boosting factor determination for the impulse sample in Impulse Postfix OFDM systems","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043104S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4726083,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, joint transmitter and receiver design might achieve further improvement. The optimum precoding and decoding matrices can be solved iteratively. In this paper, we propose a modified joint iterative algorithm, based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion in both transmitter and receiver sides. The proposed method makes better use of the channel information and has faster convergence speed than existing methods. Moreover, it uses a regularization factor to replace the Lagrange multiplier used in existing methods, which makes the calculation procedure simpler. Simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726091","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","startPage":"424","endPage":"427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for MIMO-broadcast channels with joint linear transmitter and receiver design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for MIMO-broadcast channels with joint linear transmitter and receiver design","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726091/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439277","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for MIMO-broadcast channels with joint linear transmitter and receiver design","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040464S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4726092,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Thiele","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37289376400"},{"name":"Malte Schellmann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Malte","lastName":"Schellmann","id":"37296008500"},{"name":"Thomas Wirth","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wirth","id":"37572846600"},{"name":"Volker Jungnickel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications (Heinrich Hertz Institut), Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Jungnickel","id":"37280807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726092","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Equalizers","Base stations","Frequency synchronization","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Interchannel interference","Frequency conversion","Estimation error","Receivers","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","cochannel interference","equalisers","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","synchronous downlink MIMO-OFDMA system","linear equalizer","cellular radio system","cochannel interference","base station","synchronization","3G long term evolution radio system","spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Cellular radio systems are often limited due to the presence of cochannel interference. Basically, radio systems may be operated by utilizing asynchronous or synchronous downlink transmission from all base stations in the system, where synchronization between terminals and their serving base station is mandatory in both concepts. We provide a comparison between the theoretical achievable spectral efficiency in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems using different linear equalizers and their resulting performance taking estimation errors into account. It is shown, that the choice of the appropriate receiver depends on the degree of synchronization in the system.

Generally, Kalman filter must be initialized by training sequences, but in interception systems, such sequences don\u00bft exist. So, we propose in this paper to use blind source separation to estimate the first transmitted symbols and we use them like pilot symbols for initializing Kalman filter. Performances obtained by using a Kalman filter initialized by blind source separation are better than blind source separation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind tracking of time-varying MIMO channel with Alamouti scheme in interception context","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726095","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726095.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind tracking of time-varying MIMO channel with Alamouti scheme in interception context","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726095/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind tracking of time-varying MIMO channel with Alamouti scheme in interception context","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059707S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4726096,"authors":[{"name":"Trong-Anh Huynh","affiliation":["CSA & VLSI Lab, Department of Electronics Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Trong-Anh","lastName":"Huynh","id":"38181886300"},{"name":"Dinh-Chien Hoang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ho Chi Minh city of Polytechnic University, Vietnam"],"lastName":"Dinh-Chien Hoang","id":"37648686400"},{"name":"Mohammad Rakibul Islam","affiliation":["CSA & VLSI Lab, Department of Electronics Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Rakibul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37066832300"},{"name":"Jinsang Kim","affiliation":["CSA & VLSI Lab, Department of Electronics Engineering, Kyung Hee University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jinsang Kim","id":"37293485100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726096","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Very large scale integration","Throughput","Computational complexity","Pipeline processing","Integrated circuit technology","Degradation","Bit error rate","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","signal detection","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-level-search sphere decoding algorithm","breadth-first search sphere decoding","multiple-input multiple-output detection","computational complexity","pipeline feature","tree search","symbol detection"]}],"abstract":"Breadth-first search sphere decoding (SD) is considered as one of the most promising methods for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection due to its low computational complexity, capability of providing fixed throughput and pipelining features. However, the performance of the conventional breadth-first search SD is significantly degraded if the number of candidate symbols kept at each level of the tree search is not sufficiently large. To solve this problem, we present a novel two-level-search sphere decoding algorithm for MIMO systems. In our proposed algorithm, symbol detection is concurrently performed on two levels of the tree search, and the search space is extended to find good candidate symbols. The use of simultaneous two-level search is to greatly reduce the possibility of discarding good candidates at early stages. Compared to the traditional breadth-first search SD algorithm, our approach provides a performance gain of about 2.5 dB at a bit-error-rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n.

Especially in cellular systems, multiple antennas can be exploited to achieve higher rates without the need for additional base station (BS) sites. In this direction, this paper investigates the multi-antenna capacity scaling in a cellular system which employs multicell processing (hyper-receiver). The model under investigation is a MIMO Gaussian cellular multiple-access channel (GCMAC) over a planar cellular array in the presence of power-law path loss and flat fading. Furthermore, the considered cellular model overcomes the assumption of user collocation utilized by previous models by incorporating uniformly distributed user terminals (UTs). The asymptotic eigenvalue distribution (a.e.d.) of the covariance channel matrix is calculated based on free-probabilistic arguments. In this context, we evaluate the effect of multiple BS/UT antennas on the optimal sum-rate capacity by considering a variable-density cellular system. Finally, the analytical results are interpreted in the context of a typical real-world macrocellular scenario.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726097.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink capacity of MIMO cellular systems with multicell processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Power system modeling","Fading","Throughput","Transmission line matrix methods","Channel capacity","Decoding","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","antenna arrays","channel capacity","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink capacity","MIMO cellular systems","multicell processing","Gaussian cellular multiple-access channel","user terminals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Uplink capacity of MIMO cellular systems with multicell processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4726097/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439283","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink capacity of MIMO cellular systems with multicell processing","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048132S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4726100,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Stiglmayr","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Stiglmayr","id":"37293797600"},{"name":"Johannes Klotz","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Klotz","id":"37321402600"},{"name":"Martin Bossert","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Applied Information Theory, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bossert","id":"37270633600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726100","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","MIMO","Modulation coding","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation","Equalizers","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","AWGN channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","antenna arrays","channel coding","equalisers","interference suppression","interleaved codes","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","signal detection","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual information","bit-interleaved V-BLAST space-time transmission architecture","interference cancellation","MMSE equalizer","decoding","channel code","MIMO channel realization","AWGN channel","adaptive modulation","adaptive coding","signal detection","antenna array"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present the mutual information of a bit-interleaved V-BLAST space-time architecture.

In this study we have looked at the detection problem using an antenna array. Under noise only case, the array covariance matrix has reasonably equal eigenvalues. On the other hand when a signal is present, the strongest eigenvalue is dissimilar to the rest. To measure the equality of the eigenvalues we use the sphericity test. We have found that under realistic assumptions about noise uncertainty and signal correlation the array based sphericity method of signal detection can perform better than the ED.

In such cases, the well-known Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) is one possible nonlinear approach to improve the quality of the receiver. However, adapting the DFE filter coefficients to equalize time-varying channels is computationally intense, especially if the dimension of the observation vector is very high. In this paper, we apply the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm to a conventional Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) DFE in order to reduce its computational complexity. Moreover, we compare its performance to the one of MMSE DFE versions which are based on the computationally efficient Least-Mean-Square (LMS) or Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) algorithm, respectively. The analysis additionally includes a detailed investigation of computational complexity with respect to the required number of FLoating point OPerations (FLOPs). Simulation results when applied to a digital communications system show the ability of the CG based MMSE DFE to outperform either the LMS and the RLS based MMSE DFE although its computational complexity is even smaller in most of the cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4726111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4726111/","accessionNumber":"10439297","displayDocTitle":"Conjugate gradient based MMSE Decision Feedback Equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conjugate gradient based MMSE Decision Feedback Equalization","confLoc":"Reykjavik, Iceland","sourcePdf":"SPI-12162008-00121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081055S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4695855","isNumber":"4725990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4695855","xplore-issue":"4725990","articleId":"4726111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4726115,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Geldmacher","affiliation":["Information Processing Lab Department of Electrical Engineering, Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Geldmacher","id":"37596549600"},{"name":"Klaus Hueske","affiliation":["Information Processing Lab Department of Electrical Engineering, Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Hueske","id":"37396269300"},{"name":"Jurgen Gotze","affiliation":["Information Processing Lab Department of Electrical Engineering, Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Gotze","id":"37284465400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2488-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2489-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0217"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"}],"articleNumber":"4726115","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Information processing","Energy consumption","Degradation","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","convolutional codes","decoding","probability","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block decoding","convolutional codes","scarce-state-transition decoding","syndrome decoding","probability","trellis state","power consumption reduction","power consumption parallelization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4726115","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS.2008.4726115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4725990","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4695855/4725990/04726115.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Syndrome based block decoding of convolutional codes","abstract":"A block processing approach for decoding of convolutional codes is proposed.

The 1D representation of the contours would help to decrease the computational complexity of processing the 2D signal, thereby increase the speed of the process. In order to represent a 2D image in terms of a 1D signal, the contour of the image is used. Various contour following algorithms exist for tracing contours. Some contours may contain two or more paths. To handle such situations a new algorithm is proposed that takes into account all the branches available and represent them as a 1D signal. Also in the process of tracing a new method of dynamic mask is introduced by which the number of coefficients to represent a contour is further reduced by a large factor.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728240","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contour Image Indexing using Dyadic Wavelet Transform of One Dimensional Signal with Branch Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contour Image Indexing using Dyadic Wavelet Transform of One Dimensional Signal with Branch Compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438024","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contour Image Indexing using Dyadic Wavelet Transform of One Dimensional Signal with Branch Compensation","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086499S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4728248,"authors":[{"name":"Elie Inaty","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Balamand, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Elie","lastName":"Inaty","id":"37268336000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728248","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol for wireless personal area networks (WPAN) supporting multirate traffic.

It describes both traditional style approaches based on the OpenGL graphics API and new ones based on the recent technology trends of major hardware vendors. It presents an efficient implementation of the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm in the novel CUDA platform by Nvidia. AES is currently the most widely adopted modern symmetric key encryption standard. The performance of the new fastest GPU solution is compared with those of the reference sequential implementations running on an Intel Pentium IV 3.0 GHz CPU. Unlike previous research in this field, the results of this effort show for the first time the GPU can perform as an efficient cryptographic accelerator. The developed solutions run up to 20 times faster than OpenSSL and in the same range of performance of existing hardware based implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728256","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728256.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CUDA Compatible GPU as an Efficient Hardware Accelerator for AES Cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"CUDA Compatible GPU as an Efficient Hardware Accelerator for AES Cryptography","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728256/","accessionNumber":"10438038","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CUDA Compatible GPU as an Efficient Hardware Accelerator for AES Cryptography","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05008S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4728259,"authors":[{"name":"Anwar Jarndal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Hodeidah University, Hodeidah, Yemen"],"firstName":"Anwar","lastName":"Jarndal","id":"37294476700"},{"name":"Gunter Kompa","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequenztechnik, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Gunter","lastName":"Kompa","id":"37266937500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728259","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","High power amplifiers","Wireless communication","Intermodulation distortion","Pulse measurements","Predictive models","Spline","Distortion measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","integrated circuit design","intermodulation distortion","power amplifiers","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-signal model","HEMT","high power amplifiers","next generation wireless communication systems","self-heating induced current dispersion","B-spline approximation technique","intermodulation distortion simulation","AlGaN-GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GaN HEMT","high power devices","large-signal modeling","semiconductor simulation","wireless communication systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728259","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728259.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Signal Model for AIGaN/GaN HEMT for Designing High Power Amplifiers of Next Generation Wireless Communication Systems","abstract":"In this paper, an accurate table-based large-signal model for AIGaN/GaN HEMT accounting for trapping and self-heating induced current dispersion is presented.

We also examine the impact of cross polarization discrimination (XPD) on the mean mutual information of MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728286.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Channel Capacity with Polarization Diversity and Power Allocation Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel capacity","Polarization","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Channel state information","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","diversity reception","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO channel capacity","polarization diversity","power allocation technique","multiple-input multiple-output antenna arrays","spatial diversity technique","channel state information","signal-to-noise ratio","cumulative distribution function","cross polarization discrimination","mean mutual information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Input Multiple-Output","Channel Capacity","Spatial and Polarization Diversity","Channel State Information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Channel Capacity with Polarization Diversity and Power Allocation Technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728286/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438064","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Channel Capacity with Polarization Diversity and Power Allocation Technique","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039075S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4728289,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose the FASA (Fairness insured Aggressive Sub-channel Allocation) algorithm, a dynamic channel allocation algorithm that considers all the users' channel state information conditionally to maximize throughput while considering fairness. A dynamic power allocation algorithm, i.e., an improved CHC algorithm, is also proposed in this paper to be combined with the FASA algorithm. The improved CHC algorithm collects the extra downlink transmit power and then re-allocates it to other potential users. Simulation results show that the joint allocation scheme with the improved CHC power allocation algorithm provides an additional increase of sector throughput with simultaneous enhancement of the fairness. Furthermore, by addressing the difference between uplink and downlink scheduling in an IEEE 802.16e OFDMA TDD system, we employ the uplink channel information directly through channel sounding, which yields more accurate uplink dynamic resource allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and

Recent discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithms reduce additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and inter-channel interference (ICI) iteratively through low-pass filtering. The proposed algorithm compensates the phase shift which is formed by allocation of antenna pilot sub-carriers except those of the first antenna, then by eliminating the iteration and keeping satisfactory performance, reduces complexity considerably. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm slightly outperforms the iterative algorithm in addition to complexity reduction by eliminating iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728335","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728335.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-Iterative Channel Estimation Algorthm for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems with Comb-Type Pilots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Iterative Channel Estimation Algorthm for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems with Comb-Type Pilots","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728335/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438108","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728335/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Iterative Channel Estimation Algorthm for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems with Comb-Type Pilots","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075132S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4728336,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.R.J.

In video communications over wireless channels, the noise and multipath fading effects have a significant effect on the perceptual video quality. However, it is noted that in all the research literature on DVC, an error free ideal communication channel is assumed. In this paper, we take into account the effects of noise and fading in a wireless channel on the performance of a DVC codec with necessary modifications to the decoding algorithm while proposing a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) based diversity scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed DVC system with 2\u00d72 MIMO channel outperformed the state of the art H.264/AVC video codec at channel SNR levels below 16 dB under similar conditions. Further, possible enhancements to the MIMO configuration are also discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728336","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728336.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Video Coding With MIMO for Video Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728336/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Video Coding With MIMO for Video Wireless Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438109","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728336/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Video Coding With MIMO for Video Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055813S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4728340,"authors":[{"name":"Anoosheh Heidarzadeh","affiliation":["Wireless Multimedia Communications Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Anoosheh","lastName":"Heidarzadeh","id":"38483141500"},{"name":"Farshad Lahouti","affiliation":["Wireless Multimedia Communications Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Lahouti","id":"37284780900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728340","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728340","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Source coding","Parity check codes","Decoding","Noise figure","Protection","Channel coding","Wireless sensor networks","Signal processing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed joint source-channel coding","low density parity check codes","noisy channels","Slepian-Wolf decoding","distributed source compression","error protection","syndrome-based decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Slepian-Wolf coding","LDPC","distributed joint source channel coding (DJSCC)","syndrome-based decoding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider distributed source coding (DSC) problem over actual noisy channel addressed as distributed joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) while targeting the important applications of real-world transmission.

Extended basis functions were used to reliably treat the discontinuity of the current at the free ends. A surface kernel was used over all of the antenna structure. It was found that the axially-directed component of the current distribution around the surface of the wire was highly non-uniform and that there was also a significant circumferential current flow due to capacitance between parallel wires, both of these being effects that are overlooked by standard filamentary current representations using an extended kernel. The impedance characteristic showed good agreement with the predictions of a standard filamentary-current code, in the case of applied uniform excitation along the local axis of the wire. However, the power loss computations produce significantly different results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728343.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Power Loss Computation of Closely-Spaced Radiating Wire Elements for Mobile Phone MIMO Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Mobile handsets","MIMO","Surface treatment","Current distribution","Kernel","Capacitance","Wireless communication","Antenna theory","Electric resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","current distribution","method of moments","MIMO communication","mobile handsets","wire antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power loss computation","closely-spaced radiating wire element","mobile phone","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO application","moment-method formulation","geometrically-orthogonal basis function","nonuniform surface current distribution","surface kernel","antenna structure","impedance characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Power Loss Computation of Closely-Spaced Radiating Wire Elements for Mobile Phone MIMO Application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728343/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438113","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Power Loss Computation of Closely-Spaced Radiating Wire Elements for Mobile Phone MIMO Application","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152912S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4728346,"authors":[{"name":"Oomke Weikert","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Helmut Schmidt University-University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Oomke","lastName":"Weikert","id":"37661953000"},{"name":"Udo Zolzer","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Helmut Schmidt University-University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Udo","lastName":"Zolzer","id":"37376321800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728346","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Demodulation","Frequency","Continuous phase modulation","Pulse modulation","Blind source separation","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Channel estimation","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","continuous phase modulation","demodulation","error statistics","MIMO communication","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered MIMO CPM receiver system","incoherent demodulation","multiple-input multiple-output wireless transmission system","continuous phase modulation","frequency offset handling","blind signal separation","wireless channel","nonbinary modulation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO systems","Continuous phase modulation"]}],"abstract":"A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless transmission system with continuous phase modulation (CPM) is considered.

The BSS permits the demodulation of each separated signal by an incoherent CPM demodulator. For bandwidth efficient transmission partial response CPM and non-binary modulation is applied.

In this work we present a non-iterative method for blind beamforming avoiding a multidimensional search as for Maximum Likelihood estimators. Only a two-dimensional search for the minima of a cost function in the differential wavenumber vector plane has to be accomplished. The antenna may have arbitrary but known element positions whereas the receivers gains and phases are unknown. The sensor array elements are assumed to have up to a multiplicative constant the same, angle dependent, unknown gain pattern and negligible small inter element couplings. In simulations we compare our method with a weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728352/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10438122","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728352/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Method for Deterministic Blind Beamforming with Unknown Receiver Gain and Phases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Method for Deterministic Blind Beamforming with Unknown Receiver Gain and Phases","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079788S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4728355,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed scheme uses directly the spreading codes and doesn't require the calculation of the cross-correlation matrix which results in a considerable reduction in computational complexity. Hence it is suitable for long-code CDMA systems such as IS-95 and UMTS where the cross-correlation matrix is changing every symbol. We determine the condition of convergence of the proposed scheme and prove that it converges to the decorrelator detector if the over-relaxation factor is within the interval (0, 2).

The resulting 3D based correlation functions contain general non-isotropic 2D based functions, as well as isotropic 3D based functions as special cases.

Also, as means of proving the validity of the derived correlation functions, a multichannel autoregressive (AR) simulation method is used to generate channel samples possessing those correlation statistics.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728402","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728402.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","startPage":"648","endPage":"651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Channel Correlation of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Based on Non-isotropic 3D Scattering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Channel Correlation of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Based on Non-isotropic 3D Scattering","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728402/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438169","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Channel Correlation of MIMO Rayleigh Fading Based on Non-isotropic 3D Scattering","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062214S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4728407,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We map contention of the CRs and the behavior of primary users on suitable parameters of the queueing network.

A new robust decorrelating detector (RDD) is proposed which compensates the channel estimation errors by modifying the channel matrix in the system. RDD also deals with the timing errors by the modification of the spreading matrix, and finally, it passes the impulsive components of the additive noise through a robust non-linearity to reduce the impulsive effects.

Bit error rate (BER) performance is degraded because the orthogonal properties between the sub-carriers are broken down. In this paper, the number of sub-carriers is chosen according to the consideration of the trade off between the amount of ICI and data rate of the system. ICI self-cancellation of Mapping Method introduced here is also studied to reduce ICI effectively.

In addition, it does not rely on voice activity detection (VAD), thus avoids the performance degradation due to effects of speech detection errors which are permanent with GSC technique. The good performance of the proposed multi-microphone technique over GSC technique for additive noise reduction has been verified via computer simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Speech enhancement","Adaptive filters","Delay","Noise cancellation","Degradation","Additive noise","Statistics","Microphone arrays","Background noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","IIR filters","microphone arrays","signal denoising","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimicrophone noise reduction technique","IIR-RLS filter","speech communication systems","voice activity detection","speech detection","GSC technique","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filter","Microphone array","noise reduction","upsampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728442","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728442.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Microphone Noise Reduction Technique based on Upsampling and IIR-RLS Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Microphone Noise Reduction Technique based on Upsampling and IIR-RLS Filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728442/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728442/","accessionNumber":"10438203","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Microphone Noise Reduction Technique based on Upsampling and IIR-RLS Filter","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033252S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4728446,"authors":[{"name":"Gian-Domenico Licciardo","affiliation":["Department of Information and Electrical Engineering, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Salerno, Italy"],"firstName":"Gian-Domenico","lastName":"Licciardo","id":"37267876400"},{"name":"Maurizio Costagliola","affiliation":["Computer Peripheral Group-Computer Systems Division, STM, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Costagliola","id":"38478027700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728446","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"In this paper an H.264/AVC baseline profile encoder is proposed, designed to be implemented on the STMicroelectronics SPEAr customizable SoC family.

MAI increases with the number of simultaneous users, resulting in deterioration in the performance and limits the maximum number of simultaneous users. Optical Hard Limiter (OHL) is known to improve the performance of the conventional OCDMA system. However, in the present of other sources of noise, the improvement is not considerable. Moreover, the need for dynamic threshold value in the conventional OCDMA receiver to recover the data is very demanding requirement particularly in the high speed LANs. To overcome these limitations, some studies have been conducted on the Optical Parallel Interference Cancellation (OPIC) through this paper. OHL is placed in front of the receiver side to mitigate the effect of MAI. The study focuses on the lowest threshold value i.e. Th=1. The results are compared to the conventional OCDMA and it shows that, OHL is effective to reduce the power of MAI and a better performance can be obtained by selecting the smallest threshold value.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Parallel Interference Cancellation with Optical Hard Limiter using the Lowest Threshold Value for Optical CDMA","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728451","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728451.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optical Parallel Interference Cancellation with Optical Hard Limiter using the Lowest Threshold Value for Optical CDMA","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728451/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10428459","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Parallel Interference Cancellation with Optical Hard Limiter using the Lowest Threshold Value for Optical CDMA","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091171S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4728454,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan R.

This technique exploits both frequency and time correlation of the channel transfer function. The frequency correlation is achieved by applying a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion which performs the separation of the channel space from the noise space and generates an uncorrelated representation of the channel transfer function. At the output of the KL expansion stage, elementary linear single-input single-output (SISO) predictors are developed by exploiting the channel time correlation. The performance of the proposed estimation algorithm is assessed through computer simulations in out-door environment. Test results show that our technique presents a better performance compared with some basic decision-directed channel estimates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decision-Directed Estimation of Time and Frequency Selective Channels for OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728474","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728474.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Decision-Directed Estimation of Time and Frequency Selective Channels for OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728474/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438227","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decision-Directed Estimation of Time and Frequency Selective Channels for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049222S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4728484,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The localization technique is being implemented on a software defined radio (SDR) system. The SDR system needs DOA estimation for: (a) beam-forming and detection, and (b) localization. The detection process needs coarse DOA estimation, while the localization needs a fine one. The technique fuses two known DOA estimation techniques: delay-and-sum and root-MUSIC. The former is a simple technique suitable for on-line (high speed) implementation required for detection. Hence, it would consume less power. The latter is a complex technique that needs higher processing time and consumes more power and would be suitable for off-line DOA estimation. Hence, the fused DOA estimation technique offers high performance with low complexity and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728486","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728486.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728486","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","startPage":"983","endPage":"986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Implementation of DOA Estimation for Node Localization on Software Defined Radios: Achieving High Performance with Low Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Implementation of DOA Estimation for Node Localization on Software Defined Radios: Achieving High Performance with Low Complexity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728486/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728486/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10428468","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Implementation of DOA Estimation for Node Localization on Software Defined Radios: Achieving High Performance with Low Complexity","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046663S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4728498,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, for proper recovery of the input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. Most algorithms proposed in literature perform channel estimation in the time domain which increases the computational complexity in multiaccess situations where the user is only interested in part of the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a frequency domain algorithm for channel estimation in OFDM. The algorithm performs eigenvalue decomposition of the channel autocorrelation matrix and approximates the channel frequency response seen by each user by the first few dominant eigenvectors. This reduces the parameter estimation space and allows estimation using a few number of pilots.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728502","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728502.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Domain Estimation of Multiple Access OFDM Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728502/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Domain Estimation of Multiple Access OFDM Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728502/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Domain Estimation of Multiple Access OFDM Channels","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039205S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4728503,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Many researches have been carried out to improve OFDM efficiency. Advantages of OFDM system make this technique as the most favorable modulation scheme for digital audio and video broadcasting in Europe. Unfortunately OFDM has the drawback of potentially high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper we propose a new technique based on selective branch for reducing peak-to-average power ratio in OFDM systems. This new method uses BCH code, Interleaving and also Rapp's power amplifier model. In this technique it is not necessary to transmit side information to receiver for recovering original data. It is shown that in most situations this proposed technique also improves the effective bit error rate (BER).","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728503","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Blind PAPR Reduction and Error Correction Method in OFDM System Using BCH Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Blind PAPR Reduction and Error Correction Method in OFDM System Using BCH Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728503/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438248","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Blind PAPR Reduction and Error Correction Method in OFDM System Using BCH Codes","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04411S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4728510,"authors":[{"name":"Manar Mohaisen","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Manar","lastName":"Mohaisen","id":"37392259000"},{"name":"KyungHi Chang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"KyungHi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728510","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Interchannel interference","OFDM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Radiofrequency interference","Downlink","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Gain","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference cancellation","coordinated symbol repetition","soft decision MLE CCI canceler","OFDM cellular networks","mobile station receiver","soft decision maximum likelihood cancellation","modified maximum ratio combining","frequency-selective channels","frequency nonselective channels","multipath fading","flat-fading channels","gain 9 dB","gain 6 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular OFDM networks","ML CCI Cancellation","Soft decision","VMIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new scheme of downlink co-channel interference (CCI) cancellation in OFDM cellular networks is introduced for users at the cell-edge.

At the mobile station (MS) receiver, we introduce a soft decision maximum likelihood CCI canceler and a modified maximum ratio combining (M-MRC) to obtain an estimate of the transmitted symbols. Weights used in the combining method are derived from the channels coefficients between the cooperated BS and the MS.

In order to have large quantization step sizes which yield more robustness, Human Auditory System (HAS) has been used. Decoder detects the watermark signal, without using the original audio signal.

We define a utility function which considers both power usage and QoS. We show that the resulting operating point using Nash bargaining model is fair and Pareto optimal, however, the Nash equilibrium operating point obtained in the noncooperative game scheme is not in general Pareto optimal. Also, we proposed a centralized power control algorithm based on conjugate gradient algorithm for multiantenna CDMA cellular systems, when the transmitted power and SINR which each user experience is constrained. In addition, we can extend the result to a fair rate optimization in a multiuser multiple antenna regime through a power control problem subject to SINR constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007

source decoder for the reconstruction of a signal, encoded using a differential source code with an adaptive quantizer, and transmitted over a noisy channel is proposed. One group of the previous related works on MMSE-based joint source channel decoding aim to reconstruct the codec parameter rather than the original signal, which is suboptimal. The other group that aim to reconstruct the original signal have not considered the adaptive differential encoder. The proposed solution results in a two stage MMSE decoder. The decoder benefits from residual redundancy at the output of the source encoder modeled by a \u00bf-order Markov model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4728537/","accessionNumber":"10438281","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient MMSE Decoder for Differential Source Coders with Adaptive Quantizer: A Joint Source Channel Coding Perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient MMSE Decoder for Differential Source Coders with Adaptive Quantizer: A Joint Source Channel Coding Perspective","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059884S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4728564,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The model is developed by using a memoryless nonlinearity followed by a dynamic LTI system (Hammerstein model) to consider the memory effects associated with wideband signals.

This implementation is based on the angle recording (AR) CORDIC algorithm and uses a fine precision 2-path floating point adder for an accurate computation of the phase shifts. A pipelined architecture is used to decrease the chip area requirements and to increase the throughput of the beamformer. The proposed approach is quantitatively evaluated by performing a comparison with am approach based on the Xilinx core generator modules. The results show that the proposed implementation outperforms the latter technique in terms of speed and area. The implemented beamformer could be used for acquiring 2D and 3D ultrasound medical images in real time.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728570","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Implementation of a High Resolution Phase Shift Beamformer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728570/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10438308","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Implementation of a High Resolution Phase Shift Beamformer","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055031S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4728574,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our approach uses the guard band to yield a unique equalizer estimate through a least square fitting (LSF) criterion. To refine the equalizer estimation, a combination of a LSF and constant modulus algorithm (CMA) based equalizer is proposed. In order to minimize the error of the overall structure, a stochastic gradient algorithm is implemented. It is shown that the proposed scheme is superior and more robust in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environments. Simulation results demonstrate that using the combination scheme improves adaptive channel equalization by increasing convergence rate and decreasing the steady-state mean square error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LSF-CMA Equalization Algorithm for OFDM System using Zero-Padding Technique","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728609","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728609.pdf","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"LSF-CMA Equalization Algorithm for OFDM System using Zero-Padding Technique","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728609/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10438340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LSF-CMA Equalization Algorithm for OFDM System using Zero-Padding Technique","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044656S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4728610,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Peng","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong university, Shanghai, China","Motorola China Research Center, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Peng","id":"37652315400"},{"name":"Jiancheng Huang","affiliation":["Motorola China Research Center, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jiancheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37657414700"},{"name":"Yaxin Zhang","affiliation":["Motorola China Research Center, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yaxin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37835116200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728610","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Microphone arrays","Adaptive filters","Noise cancellation","Interference suppression","Biomedical signal processing","Noise robustness","Acoustic beams","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive signal processing","anechoic chambers (acoustic)","array signal processing","interference suppression","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive close-talking beamforming","differential microphone arrays","GSC","generalized sidelobe canceller","nearfield GSC algorithm","adaptive noise cancellation","anechoic chamber","DSP-based real-time beamforming system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptation","array signal processing","differential array","nearfield beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Aiming at the application of arrays for close-talking, a novel type of differential microphone arrays is proposed, and a nearfield GSC (generalized sidelobe canceller) with a novel differential array is developed.

The proposed algorithm can be implemented as network or terminal-based method and it outperforms the accuracy of Enhanced Cell-ID.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728622.pdf","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Angle Of Arrival Location Estimation Technique for Existing GSM Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Angle Of Arrival Location Estimation Technique for Existing GSM Networks","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10428487","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4728622/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Angle Of Arrival Location Estimation Technique for Existing GSM Networks","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052505S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4728625,"authors":[{"name":"Samar Changuel","affiliation":["Technople Brest-Iroise, GET/ENST Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Samar","lastName":"Changuel","id":"37397065700"},{"name":"Raphael Le Bidan","affiliation":["Technople Brest-Iroise, GET/ENST Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Le Bidan","id":"37281696600"},{"name":"Ramesh Pyndiah","affiliation":["Technople Brest-Iroise, GET/ENST Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Pyndiah","id":"37269802500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1235-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1236-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4728625","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Product codes","Iterative algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Block codes","AWGN","Reed-Solomon codes","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","iterative decoding","Monte Carlo methods","product codes","Reed-Solomon codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block turbo codes","binary erasure channel","product codes","row-column iterative decoding algorithm","bounded-distance erasure decoding","Chase-Pyndiah turbo decoding algorithm","Monte-Carlo simulation","binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes","non-binary Reed-Solomon component codes","word-erasure-rate region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo code","product code","binary erasure channel","iterative decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4728625","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728625.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding of Block Turbo Codes over the Binary Erasure Channel","abstract":"This paper investigates iterative decoding of product codes over the binary erasure channel.

A proposed decoder modification is then introduced based on tracking the number of failed parity check equations in the intermediate decoding iterations, rather than relying on the final decoder output (after reaching the maximum number of iterations). Simulation results with a rate \u00bf (1024,512) progressive edge-growth (PEG) LDPC code show that the proposed modification can decrease the BER by as much as 10-to-40%, particularly for high SNR values.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728627","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728627.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Belief propagation","Iterative algorithms","Equations","Error correction","Error correction codes","Signal processing","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","iterative methods","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance","LDPC codes","bit error rate","iterative belief propagation decoding","low density parity check codes","BP algorithm","decoder iterations","typical uncorrected error patterns","oscillating patterns","signal-to-noise values","decoder modification","parity check equations","intermediate decoding iterations","progressive edge-growth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","BER performance","Belief Propagation iterative decoding","Error correction coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving BER Performance of LDPC Codes based on Intermediate Decoding Results","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728627/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728627/","accessionNumber":"10438357","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving BER Performance of LDPC Codes based on Intermediate Decoding Results","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074256S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4728628,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Khalesi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Tarbiat Moalem University, Tehran, Iran","Department of Electrical and computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Khalesi","id":"37661845600"},{"name":"A.

Effectiveness of the approach is established by comparing the information content in each input and resultant TFR.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728634","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1578","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712636/4728221/04728634.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPC.2007.4728634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4728221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Solution for Compesating Distortions of Time Frequency Representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Time frequency analysis","Spectrogram","Gray-scale","Signal processing","Testing","Chirp modulation","Filters","Distortion","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","distortion","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time frequency image representation","neural network solution","compensating image distortion","energy concentration","instantaneous frequency","blurry spectrogram","Wigner distribution","multi component signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time Frequency Analysis","TFRs","NN","Instantaneous Frequency","LMB Training Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4728634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Solution for Compesating Distortions of Time Frequency Representations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4728634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10518987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Solution for Compesating Distortions of Time Frequency Representations","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"ICSPC-00-413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054655S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4712636","isNumber":"4728221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712636","xplore-issue":"4728221","articleId":"4728634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4729091,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Yoshida","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37293216900"},{"name":"Hiroki Goto","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Goto","id":"37380306600"},{"name":"Tatsunori Omiya","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsunori","lastName":"Omiya","id":"37392540900"},{"name":"Keisuke Kasai","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kasai","id":"37301698100"},{"name":"Masataka Nakazawa","affiliation":["Research Institute of Electrical Communication, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Nakazawa","id":"37273573700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2227-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2228-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-381X"}],"articleNumber":"4729091","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"We have successfully transmitted a three-channel frequency division multiplexed 1-Gsymbol/s, 64 QAM coherent optical signal over 160-km with a 1.4-GHz spacing.

Extended operational life, however, is difficult to achieve when power-intensive functions like telemetry draw whatever little energy is available from energy-storage microdevices like thin-film lithium-ion batteries and/or microscale fuel cells. Harvesting ambient energy overcomes this deficit by continually replenishing the energy reservoir and indefinitely extending system lifetime. In this paper, a prototyped circuit that precharges, detects, and synchronizes to a variable voltage-constrained capacitor verifies experimentally that harvesting energy electrostatically from vibrations is possible. Experimental results show that, on average (excluding gate-drive and control losses), the system harvests 9.7 nJ/cycle by investing 1.7 nJ/cycle, yielding a net energy gain of approximately 8 nJ/cycle at an average of 1.6 \u00bfW (in typical applications) for every 200 pF variation. Projecting and including reasonable gate-drive and controller losses reduces the net energy gain to 6.9 nJ/cycle at 1.38 \u00bfW.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5230335/04729583.pdf","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2011578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2011578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrostatic Energy-Harvesting and Battery-Charging CMOS System Prototype","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatics","Prototypes","Microsensors","Biomedical monitoring","Aerospace industry","Defense industry","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Telemetry","Thin film circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","energy harvesting","microsensors","secondary cells","thin film devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic energy-harvesting","battery-charging CMOS system prototype","embedded wireless microsensors","power-intensive functions","energy-storage microdevices","thin-film lithium-ion batteries","microscale fuel cells","ambient energy","variable voltage-constrained capacitor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Batteries","energy harvesting","microsensors","self-powered","self-sustaining","vibration energy harvester"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic Energy-Harvesting and Battery-Charging CMOS System Prototype","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4729583/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847398","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic Energy-Harvesting and Battery-Charging CMOS System Prototype","sourcePdf":"tcsi-torres-2011578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112298S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5230335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"5230335","articleId":"4729583","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4729588,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Sadeghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5230335/4729588/4729588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nima Sadeghi (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2007.

Designing high-speed modular multiplication is thus very crucial to speed up the decryption/encryption process. In this paper, we first explore how to relax the data dependency that exists between multiplication, quotient determination, and modular reduction in the conventional Montgomery modular multiplication algorithm. Then, we propose a new modular multiplication algorithm for high-speed hardware design. The speed improvement is achieved by reducing the critical path delay from the 4-to-2 to 3-to-2 carry-save addition. The resulting time complexity of our development is further decreased by simultaneously performing the multiplication and modular reduction processes. Experimental results show that the developed modular multiplication can operate at speeds higher than those of related work. When the proposed modular multiplication is applied to modular exponentiation, both time and area-time advantages are obtained.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5230335/04729589.pdf","startPage":"2009","endPage":"2019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Algorithm for High-Speed Modular Multiplication Design","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2011585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2011585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729589/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Algorithm for High-Speed Modular Multiplication Design","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10890337","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4729589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Algorithm for High-Speed Modular Multiplication Design","sourcePdf":"tcsi-shieh-2011585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099264S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5230335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5230335","articleId":"4729589","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4729590,"authors":[{"name":"T\u00dcnde Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5230335/4729590/4729590-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["T\u00fcnde Wang received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in electrical/electronic engineering from California State University, Sacramento, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, and the M.B.A. degree from the University of California, Davis, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.","Following her B.S. degree, she worked at semiconductor chip design companies in California, including Intel Corporation.

It can convert audio bandwidth signals with high resolution using few threshold levels and digital interpolation. Samples are generated at nonuniform time intervals and then interpolated to produce uniformly spaced output samples. A periodic triangular dither signal added to the input ensures that low-amplitude or slowly varying signals are sampled and converted accurately. The dither is estimated and removed digitally before interpolation. Simulations show that greater than 10-bit resolution can be achieved with only seven comparators when using a sixth-order polynomial interpolator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4729590/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10890339","volume":"56","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Level-Crossing Analog-to-Digital Converter With Triangular Dither","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Level-Crossing Analog-to-Digital Converter With Triangular Dither","sourcePdf":"tcsi-hurst-2011586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5230335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5230335","articleId":"4729590","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4729596,"authors":[{"name":"Bipin Rajendran","affiliation":["Watson Research Center, IBM Thomas J.

The main advantages of the ridge gap waveguides compared to hollow waveguides are that they are planar and much cheaper to manufacture, in particular at high frequencies such as for millimeter and sub- millimeter waves. The latter is due to the fact that there are no mechanical joints across which electric currents must float. The gap waveguides have lower losses than microstrip lines, and they are completely shielded by metal so no additional packaging is needed, in contrast to the severe packaging problems associated with microstrip circuits. The gap waveguides are realized in a narrow gap between two parallel metal plates by using a texture or multilayer structure on one of the surfaces. The waves follow metal ridges in the textured surface. All wave propagation in other directions is prohibited (in cutoff) by realizing a high surface impedance (ideally a perfect magnetic conductor) in the textured surface at both sides of all ridges. Thereby, cavity resonances do not appear either within the band of operation. The present letter introduces the gap waveguide and presents some initial simulated results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/04729600.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.2011147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.2011147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Metamaterial-Based Waveguides in Gaps Between Parallel Metal Plates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Waveguide discontinuities","Surface waves","Surface texture","Millimeter wave technology","Hollow waveguides","Planar waveguides","Waveguide components","Microstrip","Packaging","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metamaterials","microstrip lines","plates (structures)","ridge waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local metamaterial-based waveguides","parallel metal plates","ridge gap waveguides","microstrip lines","magnetic conductor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gap waveguides","metamaterials","millimeter waves","submillimeter waves","waveguides"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Local Metamaterial-Based Waveguides in Gaps Between Parallel Metal Plates","volume":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4729600/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"10587077","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Metamaterial-Based Waveguides in Gaps Between Parallel Metal Plates","sourcePdf":"lawp-erajo-iglesias-2011147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041177S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4808186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"427","xplore-issue":"4808186","articleId":"4729600","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4729610,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4729610/4729610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Yuan Hsu (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1999 from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree in communication engineering in 2003 from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering within the Department of Communication Engineering.","His research interests include intercarrier interference cancellation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based systems and digital communication."]},"firstName":"Chao-Yuan","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37419997700"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4729610/4729610-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Rong Wu (M'89) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Tatung Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980 and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 1985, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1986, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 1989 from the State University of New York, Buffalo.","Since August 1989, he has been a faculty member with the Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

However, the assumption does not hold in high-mobility environments. As a result, intercarrier interference (ICI) is induced, and system performance is degraded. A simple remedy for this problem is the application of the zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer. Unfortunately, the direct ZF method requires the inversion of an N times N ICI matrix, where N is the number of subcarriers. When N is large, the computational complexity can become prohibitively high. In this paper, we first propose a low-complexity ZF method to solve the problem in single-input-single-output (SISO) OFDM systems. The main idea is to explore the special structure inherent in the ICI matrix and apply Newton's iteration for matrix inversion. With our formulation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) can be used in the iterative process, reducing the complexity from O (N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to O (N log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n N). Another feature of the proposed algorithm is that it can converge very fast, typically in one or two iterations. We also analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method and derive the theoretical output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). For a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM system, the complexity of the ZF method becomes more intractable. We then extend the method proposed for SISO-OFDM systems to MIMO-OFDM systems. It can be shown that the computational complexity can be reduced even more significantly. Simulations show that the proposed methods perform almost as well as the direct ZF method, while the required computational complexity is reduced dramatically.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity ICI Mitigation Methods for High-Mobility SISO/MIMO-OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2011275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04729610.pdf","startPage":"2755","endPage":"2768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2011275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity ICI Mitigation Methods for High-Mobility SISO/MIMO-OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4729610/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712984","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity ICI Mitigation Methods for High-Mobility SISO/MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hsu-2011275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109065S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4729610","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4729616,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay K.

The concept is based on simulating the behavior of ants in finding paths from the colony to food. Its searching mechanism is applicable for optimizing electric circuits with components, like resistors and capacitors, available in discrete values. However, power electronic circuits (PECs) generally consist of components, like inductors, manufactured in continuous values. Therefore, the traditional ACO algorithm cannot be applied directly. In this paper, an extended ACO (eACO) that can search the optimal values of components manufactured in discrete and continuous values is presented. The idea is based on using the orthogonal design method (ODM) to dynamically update the database of the components available with continuous values, so that these components will have \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pseudo</i>\n-discrete values in the search space. To speed up the optimization process, the ODM performs local search of the best combination around the best ant. The eACO also takes the component tolerances into account in evaluating the fitness value of each ant. The proposed algorithm has been successfully used to optimize the design of a buck regulator. The predicted results have been compared with the published results available in the literature and verified with experimental measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","volume":"24","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10475257","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4729635/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extended Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Power Electronic Circuit Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Power Electronic Circuit Design","sourcePdf":"tpel-chung-2006175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086586S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4783510","articleId":"4729635","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4729637,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Corradini","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC), University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA","Department of Management and Engineering (DTG), University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4783510/4729637/4729637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Corradini (S\u201906\u2013M'09) received the Dr.Ing. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate at the Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC), University of Colorado, Boulder.

The control structure implements a high-bandwidth hysteretic differentiator as its main building block, and realizes a nonconventional structure of PID compensation with performances comparable to analog hysteretic controls, thus breaking the bandwidth and dynamic limitations commonly encountered in typical digital control arrangements. The employment of an asynchronous A/D converter based on the threshold inverter quantization concept dramatically shrinks the average delay time that separates the sampling instant from the corrective control action. Moreover, the hysteretic nature of the derivative action results in an inherent nonlinear response to large signal load variations, which translates into fast control intervention and reduced settling times. The hysteretic differentiator employs a ring-oscillator-based modulator, which ensures resolution up to 390 ps without asking for a high-frequency clock. Both the 6-bit asynchronous A/D converter and the ring-oscillator-based modulator are designed and manufactured in the same IC using a standard 0.35 mum CMOS process. Analytical modeling, computer simulations, and experimental results on a synchronous buck converter confirm the validity of the approach and the dynamic performances achievable by the proposed control architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4729637/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475258","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Digital Hysteretic Voltage-Mode Control for DC\u2013DC Converters Based on Asynchronous Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Hysteretic Voltage-Mode Control for DC\u2013DC Converters Based on Asynchronous Sampling","sourcePdf":"tpel-mattavelli-2006611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06488S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4783510","articleId":"4729637","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4729638,"authors":[{"name":"Brian T.

However, several disadvantages exist when implementing optocoupler feedback, such as a variable loop gain due to optocoupler tolerance and sensitivity to temperature, as well as a relatively high cost. An alternative to optocoupler feedback is to use magnetic feedback, which can be designed to have insensitivity to component tolerance, and good temperature stability. Although magnetic feedback has been in use for many years, a detailed analysis and clear design procedure has not been presented in the literature. This paper presents a thorough analysis of a magnetic-feedback implementation, and provides a comprehensive design procedure that is verified on a 7-V/15-W experimental prototype.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4729638/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475281","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design Optimization of Magnetic-Feedback Control Using Amplitude Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design Optimization of Magnetic-Feedback Control Using Amplitude Modulation","sourcePdf":"tpel-irving-2006974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062038S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4729638","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4729639,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4783510/4729639/4729639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Wei Li (S\u201904\u2013M\u201906) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006.","During 2005, he was a Visiting Scholar at the Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Denmark.

The proposed strategy consists of an inverter maximum modulation index control scheme and a flux optimization algorithm. Specifically, in the inverter modulation index control, the CSI modulation index is kept at the maximum value while the current-source rectifier (CSR) is used to regulate a reduced variable DC-link current, and therefore, to control the motor current magnitude. This control scheme can effectively reduce the DC-link current, and at the same time, improve the line-side and motor-side waveforms. On the other hand, for the optimized flux control, the relationship between the rotor flux and the DC-link current is first investigated thoroughly. Based on this analysis, the DC-link current from the maximum inverter modulation index control can be minimized further by optimizing the rotor flux according to system variables such as the motor speed, the applied torque, and the motor-side capacitor size. With the proposed dc current minimization strategy, the losses in the semiconductor devices and the DC-link can be reduced, and the drive current rating could be lowered. Both simulation and experimental results on a 4.16-kV 600-hp CSI-fed drive system are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4783510/04729639.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2005982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC-Link Current Minimization for High-Power Current-Source Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729639/","displayDocTitle":"DC-Link Current Minimization for High-Power Current-Source Motor Drives","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475259","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4729639/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC-Link Current Minimization for High-Power Current-Source Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2005982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106072S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4783510","articleId":"4729639","onlineDate":"22 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4729640,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Huber","affiliation":["Delta Products Corporation, Power Electronics Laboratory, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4783511/4729640/4729640-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Laszlo Huber (M\u201987) was born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, in 1953.

Currently used closed-loop control strategies (like the Sky-Hook damping) require two sensors for each suspension. Typically, two accelerometers or an accelerometer combined with a stroke sensor are used. In this brief, a simple but innovative algorithm is proposed that is capable of providing quasi-optimal performance using a single accelerometer. The starting point of this work is the Mix-SH-ADD control algorithm, which has been recently developed and proposed. Starting from that idea, the single-sensor algorithm is derived. This algorithm pays a small price in terms of performance with respect to the mix SH-ADD algorithm, while guaranteeing cost reduction and augmented reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4729738/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370632","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Sensor Control Strategy for Semi-Active Suspensions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Sensor Control Strategy for Semi-Active Suspensions","sourcePdf":"tcst-savaresi2-906313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115682S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4729731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4729731","articleId":"4729738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":4729743,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00c9phane Boucheron","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Probabilit\u00e9s et Mod\u00e8les Al\u00e9atoires, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["St\u00e9phane Boucheron received the Doctorat degree in computer science from Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II, France, in 1988 and the Habilitation degree from CNRS, Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Orsay, France, in 2002.","During 1989\u20131990, he worked at Alcaltel-Alstom Corporate Research Center, Marcoussis, France.

Classes of memoryless sources defined by an envelope condition on the marginal distribution provide benchmarks for coding techniques originating from the theory of universal coding over finite alphabets. We prove general upper bounds on minimax regret and lower bounds on minimax redundancy for such source classes. The general upper bounds emphasize the role of the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) codes with respect to minimax regret in the infinite alphabet context. Lower bounds are derived by tailoring sharp bounds on the redundancy of Krichevsky-Trofimov coders for sources over finite alphabets. Up to logarithmic (resp., constant) factors the bounds are matching for source classes defined by algebraically declining (resp., exponentially vanishing) envelopes. Effective and (almost) adaptive coding techniques are described for the collection of source classes defined by algebraically vanishing envelopes. Those results extend our knowledge concerning universal coding to contexts where the key tools from parametric inference are known to fail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729743/","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4729743/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370492","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Coding on Countably Infinite Alphabets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding on Countably Infinite Alphabets","sourcePdf":"55tit01-agarivier-2008150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4729745,"authors":[{"name":"Charanjit S.

These codes have the property that they have extremely efficient software encoders. Using this technique, it is proved that a code which is similar to the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm, to be explained shortly) message expansion code has minimum distance 82, and that too in just the last 64 of the 80 expanded words. In fact, the proposed code has much greater distance than that of SHA-1 code, which makes our proposed hashing scheme robust against cryptographic attacks. The technique is further used to find the minimum weight of the SHA-1 code itself (25 in last 60 words), which was an open problem. Estimating minimum distance of a code given by its parity-check matrix is well known to be a hard problem. Our technique is expected to be helpful in estimating minimum distance of similar codes as well as in designing future practical cryptographic hash functions.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2008129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2008129","startPage":"33","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4729739/04729745.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provably Good Codes for Hash Function Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"Provably Good Codes for Hash Function Design","volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10390657","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4729745/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provably Good Codes for Hash Function Design","sourcePdf":"55tit01-apatthak-2008129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096744S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4729750,"authors":[{"name":"Bernard C.

However, in several situations, such as CDMA, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and intersymbol-interference (ISI) channels, the channel itself either contains inherent signal redundancy or such redundancy can readily be introduced at the transmitter. For such systems, iterative demodulation of the linear channel exploiting this redundancy using simple iterative cancellation demodulators, followed by conventional feedforward error control decoding, provides a low-complexity, but extremely efficient decoding alternative. This two-stage demodulator/decoder outperforms more complex turbo CDMA methods for equal power modes (users). Furthermore, it is shown that arbitrary numbers of modes can be supported if an unequal power distribution is adopted. These power distributions are nested, which means that additional modes can be added without disturbing an existing mode population. The main result shows that these nested power distributions enable the two-stage receiver to approach the Shannon capacity of the channel to within less than one bit for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4729739/04729761.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2008149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2008149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Stage Capacity-Achieving Demodulation/Decoding Method for Random Matrix Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Iterative decoding","Multiaccess communication","Redundancy","Power distribution","Error correction","MIMO","Turbo codes","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","equalisers","intersymbol interference","iterative decoding","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage capacity-achieving demodulation","decoding method","random matrix channel","iterative processing","linear matrix channel","turbo equalization","turbo demodulation","turbo code-division multiple access","conventional error control codes","multiple-input-multiple-output channel","MIMO communication","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","intersymbol-interference channel","transmitter","iterative cancellation demodulator","equal power mode","power distribution","receiver","Shannon capacity","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity achieving","partitioned signaling","random matrix channels","two-stage decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Capacity-Achieving Demodulation/Decoding Method for Random Matrix Channels","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4729761/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370496","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Capacity-Achieving Demodulation/Decoding Method for Random Matrix Channels","sourcePdf":"55tit01-dtruhachev-2008149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11734S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4729762,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Stauffer","affiliation":["Beceem Communications, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Erik Stauffer (S'05\u2013M'06) received the B.S. degree (bronze tablet) in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), in 2001 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2003.

Initially, space-time codes were designed to achieve one of these two types of gain. Recently, though, a tradeoff between these two system resources has been characterized by the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Achieving this optimal performance frontier requires proper coding. For diversity optimality, the signal transmitted from each antenna must redundantly describe the message bits. This redundancy has been quantified by the rate of a space-time code, which relates space-time codebook size to constituent single-input-single-output (SISO) constellation size. Achievable diversity has also been shown to decrease with increasing rates, which establishes the diversity-rate tradeoff. In this work, we consider a generalized notion of the rate of the space-time code, which we refer to as the code rate Rc, and the associated diversity-code rate tradeoff. We then generalize the diversity-multiplexing and diversity-code rate tradeoffs and find that a new diversity-multiplexing tradeoff exists as a function of the code rate.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2008127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2008127","startPage":"245","endPage":"254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4729739/04729762.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code Rate-Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Code Rate-Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4729762/","accessionNumber":"10370480","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729762/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code Rate-Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"55tit01-estauffer-2008127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060957S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4729763,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Cross","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","IBM Thomas J.

In such a network, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing and distributed scheduling. Due to channel fading, the link condition corresponding to a successful channel probing could be either good or poor. In the latter case, further channel probing, although at the cost of additional delay, may lead to better channel conditions and hence yield higher throughput. The desired tradeoff boils down to judiciously choosing the optimal stopping rule for channel probing and distributed scheduling. In this paper, we pursue a rigorous characterization of the optimal strategies from two perspectives, namely, a network-centric perspective and a user-centric perspective. We first consider DOS from a network-centric point of view, where links cooperate to maximize the overall network throughput. Using optimal stopping theory, we show that the optimal scheme for DOS turns out to be a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pure</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">threshold</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">policy</i>\n, where the rate threshold can be obtained by solving a fixed-point equation. We further devise iterative algorithms for computing the threshold. We also generalize the studies to take into account fairness requirements. Next, we explore DOS from a user-centric perspective, where each link seeks to maximize its own throughput. We treat the problem of threshold selection across different links as a noncooperative game. We explore the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium, and show that the Nash equilibrium can be approached by the best response strategy. Since the best response strategy requires message passing from neighboring nodes, we then develop an online stochastic iterative algorithm based on local observations only, and establish its convergence to the Nash equilibrium. Because there is an efficiency loss at the Nash equilibrium, we then study pricing-based mechanisms to mitigate the loss. Our results reveal that rich physical layer/MAC layer (PHY/MAC) diversities are available for exploitation in ad hoc networks. We believe that these initial steps open a new avenue for channel-aware distributed scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.2008137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4729739/04729765.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.2008137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks With Random Access: An Optimal Stopping Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4729765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729765/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks With Random Access: An Optimal Stopping Approach","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370497","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4729765/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks With Random Access: An Optimal Stopping Approach","sourcePdf":"55tit01-jzhang-2008137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111332S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4729766,"authors":[{"name":"Leonard H.

Deployment of cooperative multicell decoding depends critically on the tolopology and quality of the available backhaul links connecting the base stations. This work studies a scenario where base stations are connected only if in adjacent cells, and via finite-capacity links. Relying on a linear Wyner-type cellular model with no fading, achievable rates are derived for the two scenarios where base stations are endowed only with the codebooks of local (in-cell) mobile stations, or also with the codebooks used in adjacent cells. Moreover, both uni- and bidirectional backhaul links are considered. The analysis sheds light on the impact of codebook information, decoding delay, and network planning (frequency reuse) on the performance of multicell decoding as enabled by local and finite-capacity backhaul links. Analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and numerical results validate the main conclusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4729770/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370500","volume":"55","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Local Base Station Cooperation Via Finite-Capacity Links for the Uplink of Linear Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Base Station Cooperation Via Finite-Capacity Links for the Uplink of Linear Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"55tit01-osimeone-2008151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108893S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4729739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4729739","articleId":"4729770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4729774,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgwater, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hua Wang received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2007.","He is now a Senior Engineer at Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgewater, NJ.

All the receivers, both at the first level and the second level, reconstruct the source using the subset of descriptions they receive. The corresponding reconstructions are subject to quadratic distortion constraints. Our main result is the derivation of an outer bound on the sum rate of the descriptions so that the distortion constraints are met.

Trapping sets with certain parameter sizes are known to cause error-floors in the performance curves of iterative belief propagation (BP) decoders, and it is therefore important to identify decoding matrices that avoid such sets. Bounds on the trapping redundancy are obtained using probabilistic and constructive methods, and the analysis covers both general and elementary trapping sets.

The first experience of HVDC-turbine generator torsional interaction was observed in 1977 during field tests at Square Butte. The development of power semiconductors, specially insulated-gate bipolar transistors and gate turnoff thyristors (GTOs) has led to the small power HVDC transmission based on voltage-source converters (VSCs). The self-commutated VSC-based HVDC installations have several advantages compared to conventional HVDC-based online-commutated current source converter. The main objective of this paper is to investigate and present the detailed analysis of subsynchronous resonance (SSR), arising from a VSC-based HVDC system connected close to generating units. The analysis considers different operating modes of the converters. Based on a case study, it is shown that the dc voltage control mode of VSC operation (rectifier/inverter) close to the generator units can contribute positive damping in the torsional-mode frequency range of interest. The investigations of SSR with VSC-based HVDC is carried out based on linear (damping torque and eigenvalue) analysis and nonlinear transient simulation. While the damping torque, eigenvalue analysis, and controller design are based on the D-Q model, the transient simulation considers the D-Q model and the three-phase detailed model of VSC using switching functions. The influence of the operating modes of the converters and effects of some important parameters, such as effective short circuit ratio and generator rating are investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4729814/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370603","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Subsynchronous Resonance With VSC-Based HVDC Transmission Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Subsynchronous Resonance With VSC-Based HVDC Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-nprabhu-2005878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092046S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4729794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4729794","articleId":"4729814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4729817,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Roncero-Sanchez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, Control Engineering and Communications, E.T.S.

The control scheme deals with all three disturbances simultaneously within a bandwidth. The control structure is quite simple and yet very robust; it contains a feedforward term to improve the transient response and a feedback term to enable zero error in steady state. The well-developed graphical facilities available in PSCAD/EMTDC are used to carry out all modeling aspects of the repetitive controller and test system. Simulation results show that the control approach performs very effectively and yields excellent voltage regulation.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4729794","startPage":"277","endPage":"284","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4729794/04729817.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2002967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Versatile Control Scheme for a Dynamic Voltage Restorer for Power-Quality Improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Power quality","Power system restoration","Control systems","Power system harmonics","Voltage fluctuations","Bandwidth","Robust control","Transient response","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","feedforward","power supply quality","power system harmonics","robust control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic voltage restorer","repetitive controller","power-quality disturbances","voltage sags","harmonic voltages","voltage imbalances","robust control","feedforward term","transient response","feedback term","PSCAD-EMTDC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR)","harmonic distortion","power quality (PQ)","repetitive control","voltage sag"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Versatile Control Scheme for a Dynamic Voltage Restorer for Power-Quality Improvement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4729817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4729817/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10370592","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Versatile Control Scheme for a Dynamic Voltage Restorer for Power-Quality Improvement","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd04-proncero-sanchez-2002967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091606S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4729794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4729794","articleId":"4729817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
