However, every quantization level requires a folding stage, thus no reduction in input circuitry is found. Interpolation between the outputs of the folding stages generates additional folding signals without the need for input stages. A reduction in input circuitry equal to the number of interpolations is obtained. The converter is implemented in an oxide-isolated bipolar process, requiring 800 mW from a single 5.2-V supply.

This fast operation requires the use of submicrometer fabrication technology. To overcome the analog circuit limitations of the latter, the design of the oscillator is simplified and, in turn, highly redundant digital and analog control capability is provided. A brief review of possible oscillator structures is given and it is found that the best approach for high-speed, wide-range specifications is the relaxation network of the constant-current charge type.

The only difference between the amplified MOS image (AMI) and this new device is the transfer gate added between the photodiode pixel and the source follower. In this structure, the photoinduced charge loss in video-line parasitic capacitance is compensated to improve the sensitivity. A high-voltage-gain amplifier is used to control the input voltage of the transfer gate so as to maintain an unchanged bias voltage of the photodiode and by operating the photodiode cell as a current source. In this device, the photoinduced charge is not divided by the photodiode capacitance C/sub d/ or the capacitive load C/sub t/. Therefore, it is possible to enlarge the photodiode size, and the sensor has a large saturation exposure as well as a large photocurrent/dark-current ratio of about 30:1. The device operates on a single 5 V power supply. These features make the device suitable for applications in low light levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.90065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.90065","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2984/00090065.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2984","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090065.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new MOS imager using photodiode as current source","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"A new MOS imager using photodiode as current source","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016587","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90065/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new MOS imager using photodiode as current source","sourcePdf":"00090065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039577S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"90065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":90069,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This processor offers 5-MOPS performance in 3- mu m CMOS technology, and is implemented in a two-chip set comprising 170 K transistors. Two techniques are used to achieve this precision in a moderate circuit area. Linear approximation of the LNS arithmetic functions using logarithmic arithmetic is shown to be simple due to the particular functions involved. A segmented approach to linear approximation minimizes the amount of table space required. Subsequent nonlinear compression of each lookup table leads to a further reduction in table size. The result is that a factor of 285 reduction in table size is achieved, compared to previous techniques. The circuit area of the implementation is minimized by optimizing the table parameters, using a computer program that accurately models ROM area. The implementation is highly pipelined, and produces one result per clock cycle using a ten-stage pipeline.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.90098","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090098.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2985/00090098.pdf","startPage":"1433","endPage":"1440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.90098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 30-b integrated logarithmic number system processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 30-b integrated logarithmic number system processor","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4047644","volume":"26","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 30-b integrated logarithmic number system processor","sourcePdf":"00090098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048201S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"2985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"26","articleId":"90098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":90100,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The purpose is to develop a new design concept for high-frequency switched-capacitor (SC) filters which uses balanced non-op-amp type UGAs with tunable gain to replace conventional op-amp-based unity-gain buffers (UGBs). The proposed UGA has a normal gain of unit, but it has a greater bandwidth, better setting behavior, smaller chip area, and less transistors than op-amp-based UGB. The new UGA also has a fully differential balanced configuration. The balanced configuration and proper predistortion by CAD tools can reduce the error due to linear parasitic capacitances.

This model can be easily implemented for computer-aided analysis of circuits comprising URC lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.90105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2985","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2985/00090105.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of loaded uniform RC lines for computer-aided analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling of loaded uniform RC lines for computer-aided analysis","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4047651","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of loaded uniform RC lines for computer-aided analysis","sourcePdf":"00090105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035339S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"2985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"2","articleId":"90105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":90110,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Radiation testing is performed to understand failure mechanisms, to characterize the radiation response of specific devices, and to provide data for lot acceptance. Part selection and hardness assurance are discussed by contrasting the traditional approach with the unique aspects of space systems.

The instrument is to be included in the payload of the Cassini Saturn Mission, scheduled for launch in 1995. The individual modes of Cassini Radar Mapper will allow topographic mapping and surface imaging at few hundred meters resolution. The requirements that lay behind the design are briefly discussed, and the configuration and capability of the instrument are described. The present limited knowledge of Titan's surface and the measurement requirements imposed on the radar instrument are addressed. Also discussed are the Cassini mission and the projected orbits, which imposed another set of design constraints that led to the multitude of modes and to an unconventional antenna configuration. The antenna configuration and the different radar modes are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cassini Titan Radar Mapper","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.90164","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/2988/00090164.pdf","startPage":"867","endPage":"880","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090164.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.90164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90164","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Cassini Titan Radar Mapper","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"79","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4029042","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cassini Titan Radar Mapper","sourcePdf":"00090164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051143S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"41","articleId":"90164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":90209,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

There are two key features of this formulation, first, it allows for uniform treatment of LFSR, MISR, and multiple MISR-based signature analyzer. In addition, using this formulation, a new compression scheme for multiple output CUT is proposed. This scheme, referred to as multiinput LFSR, has the potential to achieve better aliasing than other schemes such as the multiple MISR scheme of comparable hardware complexity. Several results on aliasing are presented, and certain known results are shown to be direct consequences of the formulation. Also developed are error models that take into account the circuit topology and the effect of faults at the outputs. Using these models, exact closed-form expressions for aliasing probability are developed.

The basic physical processes involved are the formation of a pulsed streamer corona, the transformation of one of the streamers into a leader step, the temporal development of the leader channel, and the stepped propagation of the leader through the gap. The growth and structural characteristics of the corona are modeled and the results obtained are used to derive simple approximations for the spatial corona extension and the corona charge. Two leader inception mechanisms are discussed, namely, the stem and the precursor mechanisms. Inception criteria and characteristic time scales are derived for both of them in terms of the experimental parameters. A simplified model, which also predicts the random aspects of leader propagation through the gap, is presented. Some typical gas-insulation design problems are treated as examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090289.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/2993/00090289.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/14.90289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.90289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The mechanism of leader breakdown in electronegative gases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric breakdown","Gases","Corona","Breakdown voltage","Electrodes","Ionization","Temperature control","Heating","Dynamic voltage scaling","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corona","electric breakdown of gases","gaseous insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leader breakdown","electronegative gases","nonuniform field gaps","fast-rising voltage waveforms","pulsed streamer corona","leader channel","stepped propagation","spatial corona extension","corona charge","inception mechanisms","stem","precursor mechanisms","leader propagation","gas-insulation design problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"The mechanism of leader breakdown in electronegative gases","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3433146","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The mechanism of leader breakdown in electronegative gases","sourcePdf":"00090289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05619S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"2993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"127","articleId":"90289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":90292,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

A unique feature of the control method is that only one current sensor in the DC link is required. Excellent control of torque, stator flux, and motor current waveshapes is seen to be obtained without affecting the high dynamic performance associated with direct self control (DSC) of machines. By defining a control that does not use the zero voltage vector, an observer is purposed for estimation of the motor current using only one current sensor in the DC link. A direct bang-bang (sliding mode) torque controller is then derived on the basis of this current observer. Experimental verification of simulation results is included on a resonant DC link inverter drive with a switching frequency of 27 kHz. The inverter switching scheme is implemented using a real-time Motorola DSP56000 digital signal processor-based controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.90344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2995/00090344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.90344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2995","startPage":"893","endPage":"901","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090344.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control strategies for direct torque control using discrete pulse modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control strategies for direct torque control using discrete pulse modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4063204","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control strategies for direct torque control using discrete pulse modulation","sourcePdf":"00090344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042254S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","isNumber":"2995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"115","articleId":"90344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":90349,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Variable speed is achieved by adjusting the average motor voltage, just like chopper control of DC motors. The position sensorless drive proposed is based on detection of the conducting interval of free-wheeling diodes connected in antiparallel with power transistors. This approach makes it possible to detect the rotor position over a wide speed range, especially at a lower speed. Experimental results obtained from a prototype brushless DC motor of 300 W rating are shown to confirm the validity of the sensorless drive from 45 to 2300 r/min.

In addition, the third harmonic signal is also used to determine the rotor speed. Hence, the output power of the machine can be calculated with only a single sensor wire attached to the neutral point of the machine. The flux-producing component can be readily adjusted to produce the minimum input power for a fixed amount of output power (fixed speed).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Induction motor drives","Copper","Iron","Induction motors","Stators","Power generation","Induction machines","Rotors","Industry Applications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric sensing devices","harmonics","induction motors","machine control","optimal control","rotors","stators","torque","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable speed drives","machine control","harmonics","torque","optimal control","efficiency","induction motor","sensing","air-gap flux","stator current","rotor speed","output power","neutral point","input power"]}],"doi":"10.1109/28.90351","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090351.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2995/00090351.pdf","startPage":"940","endPage":"946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.90351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple efficiency maximizer for an adjustable frequency induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple efficiency maximizer for an adjustable frequency induction motor drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90351/","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4057123","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple efficiency maximizer for an adjustable frequency induction motor drive","sourcePdf":"00090351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035555S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","isNumber":"2995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"59","articleId":"90351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":90356,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown experimentally that these parasitic effects can significantly influence the performance of a VCSynRM. A synchronous reference frame steady state model of SynRM including saturation and iron losses is developed. The behavior of a vector-controlled SynRM is analyzed based on the model. It is observed that saturation and iron losses can have a significant effect on the performance of a VCSynRM. To verify the validity of the model for vector control, a digital signal processor (DSP) based vector controller was built for a 7.5 hp SynRM to experimentally evaluate performance. Experimental results concerning optimal torque/ampere and optimal efficiency operation are shown to be in general agreement with the predictions of the model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.90356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.90356","endPage":"985","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090356.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2995/00090356.pdf","startPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector control of a synchronous reluctance motor including saturation and iron loss","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90356/","displayDocTitle":"Vector control of a synchronous reluctance motor including saturation and iron loss","volume":"27","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4057128","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector control of a synchronous reluctance motor including saturation and iron loss","sourcePdf":"00090356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054546S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1991","isNumber":"2995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"166","articleId":"90356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":90357,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A speed signal is derived from the rate of change of angle of the flux linkage. A drift compensation program is proposed to avoid calculation errors in the determination of angle position and speed.

The design is based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, an exhaustive search technique which permits nonlinear pattern matching between an unknown utterance and a reference word. This design differs from previous systolic DTW designs in that all data is represented in signed-digit, base-4 format, digits are passed between processing elements in a most-significant-digit-first, digit-serial fashion, and the algorithms are pipelined at the digit level. Using most-significant digit first data flow allows digit pipelining to succeed where conventional bit-serial pipelining has failed for the arithmetic operations required in the DTW algorithm. This allows a high degree of concurrency and a high data rate to be maintained, while the pin-out requirements are kept low. As many as 25 DTW processing elements will fit on one 128-pin chip. The VLSI DTW design presented is both flexible and modular. It is independent of the number of coefficients per frame and the precision of those coefficients. The design is easily expandable in the number of frames per word and the warp factor used to achieve the nonlinear matching.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.90369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2996/00090369.pdf","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1422","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090369.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.90369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digit pipelined dynamic time warp processor (word recognition)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90369/","displayDocTitle":"A digit pipelined dynamic time warp processor (word recognition)","volume":"36","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","accessionNumber":"3271171","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digit pipelined dynamic time warp processor (word recognition)","sourcePdf":"00090369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046127S","chronDate":"Sep 1988","isNumber":"2996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"17","articleId":"90369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":90371,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The training problem is considered as a statistical parameter estimation problem. In particular, the conditional maximum likelihood estimate (CMLE), which estimates the parameter values that maximize the conditional probability of words given acoustics during training, is compared to the maximum-likelihood estimate, which is obtained by maximizing the joint probability of the words and acoustics. For minimizing the decoding error rate of the (optimal) maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder, it is shown that the CMLE (or maximum mutual information estimate, MMIE) may be preferable when the model is incorrect.

This relationship is reviewed and explored. Novel theorems for the subsampling of sequences are derived by direct use of the digital-filter-bank framework. These results are related to the theory of perfect reconstruction in maximally decimated digital-filter-bank systems. One of the theorems pertains to the subsampling of a sequence and its first few differences and its subsequent stable reconstruction at finite cost with no error. The reconstruction filters turn out to be multiplierless and of the FIR (finite impulse response) type. These ideas are extended to the case of two-dimensional signals by use of a Kronecker formalism. The subsampling of bandlimited sequences is also considered. A sequence x(n) with a Fourier transform vanishes for mod omega mod >or=L pi /M, where L and M are integers with L<M, can in principle be represented by reducing the data rate by the amount M/L. The digital polyphase framework is used as a convenient tool for the derivation as well as mechanization of the sampling theorems.<<ETX>>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classical sampling theorems in the context of multirate and polyphase digital filter bank structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.90376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/2996/00090376.pdf","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1495","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090376.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.90376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=90376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1988","displayDocTitle":"Classical sampling theorems in the context of multirate and polyphase digital filter bank structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","accessionNumber":"3271178","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classical sampling theorems in the context of multirate and polyphase digital filter bank structures","sourcePdf":"00090376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036553S","chronDate":"Sep 1988","isNumber":"2996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"43","articleId":"90376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":90378,"authors":[{"name":"T.N.

Analog/digital (A/D) hybrid realizations have the advantage that there is no need for an A/D converter array when the original signals come from an integrated sensor array. An experimental digital rank-order filter with a window size of three and arbitrary number of input bits is designed and implemented in a 3- mu m double-metal polysilicon gate CMOS process.

The rectifier can be used in high-frequency high-efficiency resonant DC/DC power converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2997/00090422.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00090422.png","startPage":"926","endPage":"928","doi":"10.1109/31.90422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.90422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class E zero-voltage-switching rectifier with a series capacitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/90422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Class E zero-voltage-switching rectifier with a series capacitor","publicationDate":"June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3456980","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class E zero-voltage-switching rectifier with a series capacitor","sourcePdf":"00090422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026344S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"2997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"27","articleId":"90422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":90471,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The method takes a computational approach to the analysis of phase-space-based information about the global behavior of the system. The desired optimal control of a system is determined with a cell-state-space-based optimal control algorithm. Output function parameter modification is accomplished through application of an error gradient estimation algorithm. The optimal control algorithm generates an optimal control table. The optimal control table is used by the gradient descent algorithm to identify the values of the output function parameters that best match the desired optimal control. Using this method, a given fuzzy rule base can be calibrated automatically.

Utilizing phase information this filter can express arbitrary tap coefficients (including general complex numbers) by coherently combining tapped signals. Experimental filters using silica-based single-mode optical waveguides, monolithically integrated on silicon substrates were developed for stable and high-speed operation. Experimental results demonstrate the operating capabilities of the filters for high-speed signal processing. The operating bandwidth was experimentally estimated.

Applying the Pade approximation, which is often used in the control system, to the calculation of the phase-error variance with the nonzero loop delay time, a high-accuracy analytic expression phase-error variance is obtained. The linewidth requirement with the nonnegligible loop delay time for phase-shift-keying (PSK) homodyne detection is obtained as delta nu =2.04*10/sup -3// tau where delta nu (hertz) is beat linewidth and tau (seconds) is the loop delay time. The linewidth requirement with small delay time approaches delta nu =6.2*10/sup -4/ R/sub b/ where R/sub b/ (bits-per-second) is the system bit rate. Results were confirmed by a 10-GB/s optical PSK homodyne detection experiment using external cavity laser diodes.

Experimental results indicate that stability can be achieved with negligible loss in least squares performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.91147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3022","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00091147.png","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1779","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3022/00091147.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.91147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for stabilizing recursive least squares filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Resonance light scattering","Adaptive filters","Roundoff errors","Explosives","Stability","Signal processing algorithms","Mobile communication","Signal processing","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","roundoff errors","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RLS filter","recursive least squares filters","fixed point analysis","error propagation mechanism","instability","roundoff errors","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for stabilizing recursive least squares filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/91147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4020501","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for stabilizing recursive least squares filters","sourcePdf":"00091147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040459S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","articleId":"91147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":91154,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The authors present an analysis of the CF-TMUX based on the polyphase component matrices of the filter banks used in TDM to FDM and FDM to TDM conversions, respectively. Thus a necessary and sufficient condition for complete CC is obtained. It is shown that the filters for a CF-TMUX are the same as the filters for a 1-skewed alias free QMF bank. In addition, if the QMF bank satisfies the perfect reconstruction (PR) property, then the TMUX also satisfies PR. The relation between CF-TMUX filters and alias-free QMF banks is used to obtain a direct design procedure for CF-TMUX filters (both FIR and IIR). It is also shown that approximately crosstalk-free TMUX filters can be obtained from any approximately alias-free QMC bank.

The main characteristic of this class is the fast computation of the gain vector needed for the adaptation of the transversal filters. The method for deriving these algorithms is based on the assumption that the input signal is autoregressive of order M, where M can be much smaller than the order of the filter to be estimated. Under this assumption the covariance matrix of the input signal is estimated by extending in a min-max way the M order sample covariance matrix. This estimate can be regarded as a generalization of the diagonal covariance matrix used in LMS and leads to an efficient computation of the gain needed for the adaptation. The new class of algorithms contains the LMS and the fast versions of LS as special cases. The complexity changes linearly with M, starting from the complexity of the LMS (for M=0) and ending at the complexity of the fast versions of LS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/91175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4053570","volume":"39","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Newton transversal filters-a new class of adaptive estimation algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Newton transversal filters-a new class of adaptive estimation algorithms","sourcePdf":"00091175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045145S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"87","articleId":"91175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":91176,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Consequently, the SVD can be applied along with 1-D finite impulse response (FIR) techniques for the design of linear-phase 2-D filters with arbitrary prescribed amplitude responses which are symmetrical with respect to the origin of the ( omega Psi omega /sub 2/) plane. The balanced approximation method is applied to linear-phase 2-D FIR filters of the type that may be obtained by using the SVD method. The method leads to economical and computationally efficient filters, usually infinite impulse response filters, which have prescribed amplitude responses and whose phase responses are approximately linear.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.91181","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00091181.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/3023/00091181.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.91181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of two-dimensional digital filters using singular-value decomposition and balanced approximation method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=91181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Design of two-dimensional digital filters using singular-value decomposition and balanced approximation method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/91181/","volume":"39","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4053576","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of two-dimensional digital filters using singular-value decomposition and balanced approximation method","sourcePdf":"00091181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052294S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"58","articleId":"91181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":91190,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is applicable to both circuit-switched and packet-switched networks and to a wide variety of network topologies.

The ATM topology consists of links (express pipes) obtained from the backbone facility via circuit switching through DCSs.

The variables in this problem are the selection of the express pipes, the routing of traffic on such pipes, and the allocation of bandwidth to pipes.

Performance was evaluated at the ATM cell level in terms of effective assigned bandwidth with respect to the peak bandwidth allocation. The gains obtained using the CRR are significant for the various bursty classes investigated with burstiness values b>or=5. It was found that the CRR is a conservative approach, based on the extensive simulation of a wide range of cases and of the assumed traffic and multiplexing models. Performance of the CRR was then evaluated at the virtual call level in terms of call blocking probability in a group of ATM trunks with respect to the peak bandwidth allocation. It was found that the CRR gain at the virtual call level is greater than the CRR gain at the ATM cell level, thus increasing the attractiveness of using statistical bandwidth assignment. All the results reported require further careful verifications, in particular to test other types of service classes and cases of multiple streams mixed with bursty and variable-bit-rate traffic sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1990.91335","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A solution to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based WAN networks that addresses this limitation is presented. The proposed lightpath architecture trades the ample bandwidth obtained by using multiple wavelengths for a reduction in the number of processing stages and a simplification of each switching stage, leading to substantially increased throughput. The principle of the lightpath architecture is the construction and use of a virtual topology network in the wavelength domain, embedded in the original network. A study is made of the embedding of virtual networks whose topologies are regular, using algorithms which provide bounds on the number of wavelengths, switch sizes, and average number of switching stages per packet transmission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Because of the different natures of all those signals, different bandwidth and dynamic range, complex analog anti-aliasing circuits, and several types of A/D (analog-to-digital) converters would normally be required to convert the signals from the analog to digital domain. With the proposed technique it is possible to carry out the conversion of the high-frequency data as well as the low-frequency control signals with only a single type of multibit sigma-delta ( Sigma Delta ) A/D converter in combination with digital signal processing. The use of Sigma Delta type A/D conversion also has other advantages such as its suitability for integration in a CMOS VLSI process and the fact that the requirements for the anti-aliasing filters in front of the converters are relaxed due to the oversampling technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.92008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.92008","startPage":"905","endPage":"909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3037/00092008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3037","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092008.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multibit oversampled Sigma Delta A/D converters as front end for CD players","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multibit oversampled Sigma Delta A/D converters as front end for CD players","publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"26","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016561","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92008/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibit oversampled Sigma Delta A/D converters as front end for CD players","sourcePdf":"00092008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028063S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"92008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":92010,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.A.

Novel highly linear transconductors consisting of N emitter-coupled pairs were designed for low-voltage operation. The linear input range is expanded to about 100 mV/sub p-p/ at 1% error with N=4, which is about twice that of the conventional linearization technique. The filter is basically a gyrator-capacitor type, in which gyrators are implemented by using the linearized transconductors. Large time constants were realized with very low current (540 nA/transconductor) owing to the high transconductance-to-operating-current ratio of the linearized transconductors. Measured results show a passband ripple of 1.5 dB, a minimum stopband rejection of 70 dB, and a dynamic range of 56 dB, despite a very high nominal impedance (400 k Omega ). Practical limitations of this approach are also discussed, such as the sensitivity of the linearized transconductors against process variations, noise, and frequency limitations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","volume":"26","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4016566","publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Realization of a 1-V active filter using a linearization technique employing plurality of emitter-coupled pairs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of a 1-V active filter using a linearization technique employing plurality of emitter-coupled pairs","sourcePdf":"00092013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042712S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"98","articleId":"92013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":92014,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method derives from high-level algorithm specifications or from high-level source programs not only the target hardware, but (in contrast to silicon compilers) also the machine code to run it. The method is based on a novel sequential machine paradigm where execution is used (being orders of magnitude more efficient) instead of simulation and where programmers may do the design job, rather than real hardware designers. It is shown that, for a very large class of commercially important algorithms (DSP, graphics, image processing and many others), this paradigm is orders of magnitude more efficient that the von Neumann paradigm. Compared to von-Neumann-based implementations, acceleration factors of up to more than 2000 have been obtained experimentally. The performance of ASICs obtained by this methodology is mostly competitive with ASIC designs obtained in the much slower and much more expensive traditional way. As a by-product the new methodology also supports the automatic generation of universal accelerators for coprocessor use in workstations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.92017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3037/00092017.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"989","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092017.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.92017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel ASIC design approach based on a new machine paradigm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"A novel ASIC design approach based on a new machine paradigm","volume":"26","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4016570","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92017/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel ASIC design approach based on a new machine paradigm","sourcePdf":"00092017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042873S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"31","articleId":"92017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":92018,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

The universal-V/sub cc/ DRAM concept features a low-voltage (1.5 V) DRAM core and an on-chip power supply unit optimized for the operation of the DRAM. A circuit technique for oxide-stress relaxation is proposed to improve high-voltage sustaining characteristics while only scaled MOSFETs are used in the entire chip. This technique increases sustaining voltage by about 1.5 V compared with conventional circuits and allows scaled MOSFETs to be used for the circuits, which can be operated from an external V/sub cc/ of up to 4 V. A two-way power supply scheme is proposed to suppress the internal voltage fluctuation within 10% when the DRAM is operated from external power supply voltages ranging from 1.5 to 3.6 V. An experimental 1.5-3.6-V 64-Mb DRAM is designed based on these techniques and fabricated by using 0.3- mu m electron-beam lithography. An almost constant access time of 70 ns is obtained.

The methodology, which can improve the physical design of testable CMOS digital ICs, is supported in realistic fault-list generation and classification. Two measures of physical testability, weighted class fault coverage and fault incidence, and one measure of fault hardness are introduced. The testability is evaluated prior to fault simulation; difficult-to-detect faults are located on the layout and correlated with the physical defects which originate them; and suggestions for layout reconfiguration are provided. Several design examples are described, ascertaining the usefulness of the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology demonstrated that stuck-at test sets only partially cover the realistic faults in digital CMOS designs. Moreover, it is shown that classical fault models of arbitrary faults are insufficient to describe the realistic fault set. Simulation results have shown that the fault set strongly depends on the technology and on the layout style.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.92027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3037/00092027.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1072","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092027.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.92027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical design of testable CMOS digital integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Physical design of testable CMOS digital integrated circuits","volume":"26","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4016580","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical design of testable CMOS digital integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00092027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082991S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"92027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":92029,"authors":[{"name":"U.

To cover a large field of applications, only slightly different realizations can be used for capacitive sensors as well as for resistive sensor bridges.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.92029","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092029.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3037/00092029.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1080","doi":"10.1109/4.92029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS readout amplifier for instrumentation applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS readout amplifier for instrumentation applications","volume":"26","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4016582","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS readout amplifier for instrumentation applications","sourcePdf":"00092029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042671S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"3037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"20","articleId":"92029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":92163,"authors":[{"name":"Yinyi Lin","affiliation":["Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yinyi Lin","id":"37068285200"},{"name":"J.K.

Separation of variables is used to convert transient-eddy-current problems into an ordinary differential equation in time and linear combination of normal modes in space. The eigensolution of the vector wave equation by the usual finite-element basis functions usually results in numerical instabilities that render the procedure worthless. It has been found that the root cause of these instabilities is the improper approximation of the null space of the curl operator. Three different methods that eliminate the instabilities completely have been developed. The first method uses C/sup 1/ or derivative continuous finite elements; the second uses tangential vector basis functions developed in a companion paper; and the third uses ordinary Lagrangian finite elements but places them in a special mesh pattern so that C/sup 1/ continuous polynomials are possible, although C/sup 1/ continuity is not imposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3366407","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Combined finite element-modal solution of three-dimensional eddy current problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined finite element-modal solution of three-dimensional eddy current problems","sourcePdf":"00092213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037701S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"3040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"56","articleId":"92213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":92217,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The film is modeled as a planar array of hexagonal single-domain particles with long-range magnetostatic as well as possible nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. Magnetization configurations are determined by following the Landau-Lifshitz equations of motion with finite damping. The media parameters used here approximate Co films. The recording geometry resembles a close flying head with a small gap. Transition fluctuations, a source of transition noise, are also suited for both non-exchange-coupled and exchange-coupled media. It is shown that intergranular exchange coupling can significantly enhance transition noise and that films with well defined nonmagnetic grain boundaries exhibit better signal-to-noise ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092219.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3040/00092219.pdf","startPage":"2706","endPage":"2708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.92219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.92219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=92219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recording and transition noise simulations in thin film media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Signal to noise ratio","Micromagnetics","Planar arrays","Magnetostatics","Elementary particle exchange interactions","Magnetization","Equations","Damping","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic recording","magnetic thin films","magnetisation","metallic thin films","noise","simulation","storage media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR","long range magnetostatic interactions","motion equations","micromagnetic simulations","magnetic storage media","transition fluctuations","nonexchange-coupled media","transition noise simulations","thin-film metallic media","planar array","hexagonal single-domain particles","nearest-neighbor exchange interactions","Landau-Lifshitz equations","finite damping","recording geometry","flying head","small gap","exchange-coupled media","intergranular exchange coupling","nonmagnetic grain boundaries","signal-to-noise ratios","Co films"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","displayDocTitle":"Recording and transition noise simulations in thin film media","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3354847","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recording and transition noise simulations in thin film media","sourcePdf":"00092219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042685S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"3040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"24","articleId":"92219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":92232,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

He briefly describes the circuit fabrication process and then introduces the modified variable threshold logic (MVTL) gate family. The lowest experimentally obtained MVTL OR-gate delay was only 2.5 ps with a power consumption of 17 mu W/gate. This gate family is used in various high-speed logic circuits, such as 8-bit shift registers, 16-bit ALUs (arithmetic logic units), and 4-bit microprocessors. The author confirmed the high-speed operation of less than 10 ps per gate on average for these circuits. A novel high-sensitivity magnetic sensor using a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) was also developed. It is called a single-chip SQUID magnetometer because the feedback circuit, which is operated at room temperature is a conventional SQUID system, has been integrated on the same chip as the SQUID sensor itself.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3041/00092398.pdf","doi":"10.1109/20.92398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.92398","startPage":"740","endPage":"749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed Josephson integrated circuit technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92398/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed Josephson integrated circuit technology","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3420902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed Josephson integrated circuit technology","sourcePdf":"00092398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053804S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"3041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"20","articleId":"92398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":92404,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The stress, optically measured for Nb films, depends on the Ar pressure during sputtering, and it changes from compressive to tensile when the Ar pressure is increased. From X-ray diffraction, the shift in the lattice constant was observed to be proportional to the film stress. Changes in the lattice constant were also clearly observed when Nb films were etched to fine patterns. This suggests that the intrinsic stress in Nb films is relaxed at peripheral areas after the patterning process, and that such relaxation is one cause of deterioration in current-voltage characteristics frequently observed in small Josephson junctions. This indicates that stress-free Nb should be used for submicrometer junctions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of intrinsic stress on submicrometer Nb/AlO/sub x//Nb Josephson junctions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.92486","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3041/00092486.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.92486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=92486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"Effects of intrinsic stress on submicrometer Nb/AlO/sub x//Nb Josephson junctions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3410360","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of intrinsic stress on submicrometer Nb/AlO/sub x//Nb Josephson junctions","sourcePdf":"00092486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042866S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"3041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"38","articleId":"92486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":92495,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The Q-spoiler was then used in an experiment to detect the oscillating electric polarization induced by /sup 35/Cl nuclear quadrupole moments. The fourth experiment involved the extension of the use of the Q-spoiler and SQUID amplifier to NMR, detecting the signal from /sup 119/Sn nuclei at 30 MHz. Finally, a SQUID amplifier was used with an untuned input circuit to detect the low-frequency NMR signal at 55 kHz from /sup 195/Pt nuclei in an applied field of 60 Gauss.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nuclear magnetic resonance","SQUIDs","Preamplifiers","Superconducting device noise","Polarization","Pulse measurements","Superconducting devices","Interference","Magnetic resonance","Magnetic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nuclear quadrupole resonance","preamplifiers","SQUIDs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC SQUID preamplifiers","magnetic resonance experiments","nuclear spin noise","spontaneous emission","zero polarization state","Q-spoiler","nuclear quadrupole resonance","NMR","oscillating electric polarization","untuned input circuit","30 MHz","55 kHz","/sup 35/Cl nuclei","/sup 119/Sn nuclei"]}],"doi":"10.1109/20.92510","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00092510.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3041/00092510.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.92510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nuclear magnetic resonance with DC SQUID preamplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=92510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nuclear magnetic resonance with DC SQUID preamplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92510/","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3410378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nuclear magnetic resonance with DC SQUID preamplifiers","sourcePdf":"00092510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042402S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"3041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"92510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":92513,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

The transresistance of the array was less than the expected value calculated from measurements obtained on a single VFT. The difference was probably due to nonuniformities in the fabrication process, which caused some of the junctions not to be biased in the flux flow state or receive the same amount of magnetic field from the control line.

The distributed amplifier design is used to raise the input impedance and the power gain of the amplifier over a wide bandwidth. The small signal current gain of the device can be increased by biasing the Josephson junction in an asymmetric configuration.

This involved anomalously high values of the maximum switching current of Josephson junctions at temperatures where thermally activated switching was expected to greatly lower it. This effect was modeled by evaluating junction parameters from the measured characteristics. The junction resistance determined from the return switching current is that of a nearly ideal quasiparticle tunneling resistance, increasing exponentially fast at low temperatures. As a result, the load resistance becomes dominant over a wide range of temperatures. The frequency dependence of this load resistance then produces the anomalously large Josephson switching currents, which have not been observed previously in junctions with significant normal conductance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/3041/00092563.pdf","startPage":"1424","endPage":"1427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.92563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.92563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=92563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalously large Josephson switching currents in low dissipation Josephson junctions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Josephson junctions","Current density","Circuits","Frequency dependence","Threshold voltage","Magnetic shielding","Batteries","Temperature","Packaging","Quantum mechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Josephson effect","modelling","superconducting junction devices","switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low dissipation junctions","model","superconducting junctions","Josephson junctions","switching characteristics","high-quality junction","frequency dependence","external circuitry","anomalously high values","maximum switching current","thermally activated switching","junction parameters","junction resistance","nearly ideal quasiparticle tunneling resistance","load resistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"Anomalously large Josephson switching currents in low dissipation Josephson junctions","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3433023","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalously large Josephson switching currents in low dissipation Josephson junctions","sourcePdf":"00092563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060971S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"3041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"92563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":92651,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Here, transform domain processing is characterized by the effect of the transform on the shape of the mean-square error surface. It is shown that the effect of an ideal transform is to convert equal error contours that are initially hyperellipses in the parameter space into hyperspheres. Five specific real-valued orthogonal transforms are compared in terms of learning characteristics and computational complexity. Since the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) is the ideal transform for this application, and since the KLT is defined in terms of the statistics of the input signal, it is certain that no fixed-parameter transform can deliver optimal learning characteristics for all input signals. However, the simulations suggest that transforms can be found which give much improved performance in a given situation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3043/00092880.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/31.92880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.92880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3043","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=92880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of orthogonal transforms for improving performance of adaptive filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Least squares approximation","Arithmetic","Convergence","Computational complexity","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Adaptive algorithm","Very large scale integration","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal transforms","adaptive filters","real-time decomposition","convergence rates","transform domain processing","mean-square error surface","error contours","hyperellipses","hyperspheres","learning characteristics","computational complexity","Karhunen-Loeve transform","fixed-parameter transform","input signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/92880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"The use of orthogonal transforms for improving performance of adaptive filters","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3421268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The use of orthogonal transforms for improving performance of adaptive filters","sourcePdf":"00092880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034062S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"3043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"135","articleId":"92880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":92883,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A unified framework makes it possible to take into account broadband, as well as low-frequency (such as flicker), noise sources by basing the modeling for all noise types on the mathematical white-noise model in which broadband noise is modeled by white noise and low-frequency noise by linearly filtered white noise. The noise signal decomposition used is different from that used in previous approaches and leads to simple and straightforward computer implementations on various approximation levels. On the basis of this solution, existing SC circuit analyzers featuring different abstraction levels can easily be extended with the noise analysis feature by using much of their original routines.

This latter class of realizations, which has not previously been synthesized, is found to be very similar to the realizations obtained by simply rescaling an optimal L/sub 2/-norm-scaled realization for L/sub infinity / scaling.

The feedback filter is composed of a relatively short FIR filter that cancels the initial part of the channel impulse response, which may contain rapid variations due to bridge taps, and a pole-zero, or IIR, filter that cancels the smoothly decaying tail of the impulse response. Modifications of an adaptive IIR algorithm, based on the Steiglitz-McBride (1965) identification scheme, are proposed to adapt the feedback filter. A measured subscriber loop impulse response is used to compare the performance of the adaptive pole-zero DFE, assuming a two-pole feedback filter, with a conventional DFE having the same number of coefficients. Results show that the pole-zero DFE offers a significant improvement in mean squared error relative to the conventional DFE. The speed convergence of the adaptive pole-zero DFE is comparable to that of the conventional DFE using the standard least mean square (LMS) adaptive algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.93092","startPage":"817","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3051/00093092.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.93092","endPage":"829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pole-zero decision feedback equalization with a rapidly converging adaptive IIR algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Pole-zero decision feedback equalization with a rapidly converging adaptive IIR algorithm","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4051532","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pole-zero decision feedback equalization with a rapidly converging adaptive IIR algorithm","sourcePdf":"00093092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045346S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","articleId":"93092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":93094,"authors":[{"name":"H.

When baud-space feedforward filters are used, PAM has 1-2 dB more SNR than QAM, where the type of PAM is the 2B1Q line code. However, when using fractionally spaced feedforward equalizers (FSEs), the SNRs of 2B1Q and QAM are almost equal for loops at the extreme range of a CSA. Four- and 16-state trellis-coded modulation is applied to PAM and QAM. Coded and uncoded PAM and QAM are simulated with parallel decision feedback estimation. Viterbi receivers and coding gains are computed. QAM has up to 1 dB higher coding gains that PAM. However, the higher coding gains of QAM do not compensate for the lower SNR of uncoded QAM, and coded QAM has worse performance than coded PAM in the presence of self near-end crosstalk. The error rates of PAM and QAM with impulse noise are computed using a collection of measured impulse noise events.

The DMT transmitter and receiver structure and algorithms are detailed, and the computational requirements of DMT for HDSL are estimated. At a sampling rate of 640 kHz, using an appropriate combination of a short finite-impulse-response (FIR) equalizer and a length-512 DMT system, 1.6 Mb/s data transmission is possible within the carrier serving area (CSA) at an error rate of 10/sup -7/ on a single twisted pair. A significant performance margin can be achieved when two coordinated twisted pairs are used to deliver a total data rate of 1.6 Mb/s. In terms of a performance-per-computation figure of merit, the DMT system is an excellent candidate for HDSL implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.93100","doi":"10.1109/49.93100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3051/00093100.pdf","startPage":"895","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete multitone transceiver system for HDSL applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A discrete multitone transceiver system for HDSL applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4051540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete multitone transceiver system for HDSL applications","sourcePdf":"00093100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060891S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"353","articleId":"93100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":93101,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

An expression is derived on the minimum mean square performance of a continuous-time infinite-length decision feedback equalizer in the presence of multiple cyclostationary interferers and additive white noise. This expression is calculated for a subscriber line system to show the performance improvements over the situation where the interference is stationary with the same power spectrum. Linear equalizer performance curves were also added to the comparisons. These results show two techniques which can provide opportunities for improved equalizer performance by enhancing the cyclostationarity of the interference. The first is by decreasing the misalignment of the phases of the transceiver clocks in the central office transmitters. The second is by using transmitter pulse bandwidths which are wide relative to the symbol rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.93103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/3051/00093103.pdf","startPage":"931","endPage":"940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.93103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum mean square equalization in cyclostationary and stationary interference-analysis and subscriber line calculations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=93103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93103/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum mean square equalization in cyclostationary and stationary interference-analysis and subscriber line calculations","volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4051543","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum mean square equalization in cyclostationary and stationary interference-analysis and subscriber line calculations","sourcePdf":"00093103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057553S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"75","articleId":"93103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":93182,"authors":[{"name":"N.

When the signal light is not at the gain peak of the EDFA, gain tilt exists and EDFA cannot be used in an AM-FDM optical analog video transmission system because of CSO degradation. To counteract the gain tilt induced CSO, the authors demonstrated that codoping Al and setting the laser oscillation wavelength at the gain peak are useful. Er-Al-codoped fiber amplifiers have better linearity than Er-doped fiber amplifiers because the gain tilt of the former is smaller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00093272.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3057/00093272.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.93272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.93272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=93272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion due to gain tilt of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical distortion","Erbium-doped fiber lasers","Intermodulation distortion","Optical coupling","Laser noise","Laser theory","Chirp","Stimulated emission","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","erbium","fibre lasers","optical communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Er doped fiber amplifiers","composite second order distortion","gain tilt","second-order intermodulation product","coupling","laser chirp","signal light","gain peak","AM-FDM optical analog video transmission system","codoping","laser oscillation wavelength"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Distortion due to gain tilt of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","volume":"3","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4085273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion due to gain tilt of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00093272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051599S","chronDate":"Oct.  1991","isNumber":"3057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"33","articleId":"93272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":93273,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

A combination of design innovations and process and materials breakthroughs that can overcome these problems is presented. PZT (lead zirconate titanate) is chosen as the basic ferroelectric material and integrated into a standard CMOS process. PZT has a wide temperature range (+350 degrees C Curie temperature), low coercive voltage, high specific polarization charge (10-20 mu C/cm/sup 2/), and good retention and endurance. The lack of a well-defined coercive field was overcome with a DRAM-like circuit architecture, which provides for transistor switches in series, with each ferroelectric element preventing disturb pulses from affecting the unselected cells. As a demonstration vehicle, a fully decoded 256-b nonvolatile ferroelectric random-access memory (FRAM) was developed. The switching speed inherent in the PZT material was found to be on the order of 1 ns.

The application of more advanced methods, such as partial-response (PR) signaling and maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD), allows a further increase in the recording densities and reliability presently achieved. After reviewing RLL coding an PD schemes, recording systems using PR signaling and MLSD (PRML) are described. Viterbi decoding and decision-directed algorithms for automatic gain control and timing recovery are discussed for the two types of PR scheme best suited for magnetic recording, class-IV (PR-IV) and extended class-IV (EPR-IV). Results of a performance study on PD and PRML systems which demonstrate the superiority of the PRML approach are presented. For the two PRML systems considered, sensitivity to various parameters and performance in an off-track situation were investigated. The results shown indicate that the two schemes are equally robust and that PR-IV signaling is superior to EPR-IV in off-track situations. A PRML system based on PR-IV signaling is also simpler to realize.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93353","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Further, three variable-threshold NNs (color identification) are introduced. The detection of motion is also done in this second layer using already preprocessed information represented by on-off, on, and off signals, with the same meaning as the corresponding signals from the human ganglion cells; four analog classifiers are used for directions (up, down, left, right). The results of a program used to simulate the proposed NN are discussed, as well as a theoretical VLSI implementation.

These algorithms perform mapping and filling at the same time, while respecting the connectivity of the original image. As a result, the transformations become more consistent and accurate. The essential parallelism in the new algorithms also facilitates their implementation using VLSI architecture, such that the time complexity is the only O(N) compared with O(N/sup 2/) using a uniprocessor, where n is the dimension of the image plane. The new algorithms can handle all kinds of images, including those of long narrow objects which present problems to other algorithms. They also reduce the errors introduced by the order in which rotation and scaling are applied. A series of experiments was conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results indicate that the new algorithms and VLSI architectures can be very useful to image-processing, pattern recognition, and related areas, especially real-time applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93389","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Instead of noisy analog multiplexers, digital multiplexing is achieved utilizing high-performance sigma-delta modulators. Due to the oversampling approach, no sample-and-hold circuitry is needed, and only a very simple analog antialias filtering is required. The one-bit-oversampled data includes quantization noise, which is out of the signal band and can be filtered out digitally. Two of the channels have high-resolution constraints, and they use low-order IIR filters and a simple decimation stage. The IIR filters use no general multipliers. The other two channels are mainly for estimation of spectral information of the signal. Therefore, an efficient linear-phase decimation filter is used to remove the quantization noise of the modulator. The resolution requirements in these channels are less than in the other two. The digital filters also work as antialiasing filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93419","startPage":"3/126","endPage":"3/128","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

An innovative non-von Neumann principle eliminates one of them. Its new processor, the map-oriented machine (MOM), is compared with the von Neumann concept. The MOM is the key resource to a completely new philosophy of data processing, map-oriented processing. It does not use sequential programs since it has no program sequencer. For many applications it provides acceleration factors of up to several orders of magnitude, compared to von-Neumann-type processing. Existing computer application support tools (assemblers, compilers, operating systems, etc.) cannot be used for the MOM, since they produce sequential code. Thus, a new programming theory and new application support tools are introduced, so that MOM is based on a marriage between standard IC and application-specific IC techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93471","startPage":"5/7","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00093471.png","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In view of the large number of sizes currently used in circuit design, the common use of polynomial fits and tables was deemed to be too restrictive in the designer's choice of transistor size or too inaccurate for circuit simulation. This is particularly true for analog design. Therefore, a new procedure has been developed and introduced into the design strategy. This permits unlimited choice of device geometry without reducing the precision of the circuit simulation. The proposed solution allows the continued use of standard SPICE MOS models and even increases simulation accuracy and reliability by calculating model parameter sets for all individual transistor sizes. It also standardizes the transition from measurement and model parameter extraction to electrical-circuit analysis. The need to simulate statistical behavior is implemented in a user-friendly way.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93491","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The possible range of applications as a contactless diagnostic method for integrated circuits in the real-time and sampling modes of photoemission probing is discussed on the basis of theoretical and experimental studies.

If the reference electrode is at the same potential as the point of electron emission on the VLSI circuit, all photoemitted electrons can pass the reference electrode and are guided towards an electron detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1989.93494","startPage":"5/105","endPage":"5/109","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A major difficulty in using broadcast communication is the issue of access to the channel. The authors deal with the following prioritized conflict resolution problem: a collection of c messages is initially distributed among nodes on an MABN; each message is associated with a value representing its priority or deadline; and it is required that the messages be broadcast in ascending order of this value. This problem is solved by a distributed prioritized conflict resolution algorithm. It is proved that the expected waiting time of the ith network node to transmit is Theta (i+log c), which is optimal. It is also shown that the algorithm runs in the expected linear time, which is optimal in both the number of slots used and the total elapsed time including local processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.93743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/3063/00093743.pdf","startPage":"1102","endPage":"1108","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00093743.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.93743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal prioritized conflict resolution on a multiple access channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=93743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93743/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal prioritized conflict resolution on a multiple access channel","volume":"40","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4078660","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal prioritized conflict resolution on a multiple access channel","sourcePdf":"00093743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036628S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"5","articleId":"93743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":93744,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These graphs are regular, point-symmetric, and maximally connected, and one such optimal graph exists for any given number of nodes. The proposed interconnection schemes consist of mesh-connected networks with wrap-around links, and are isomorphic to the optimal distance circulants previously considered. Ways to construct one such network for any number of nodes are shown, their good properties to build interconnection schemes for multicomputers are examined, and some interesting particular cases are discussed.

This modular approach is intended for a telephone trunk network consisting of high-bandwidth fiber-optic links connected through reconfigurable digital cross-connect nodes. It works for both node and link failures. This approach comprises a distributed protocol with two parts. First, the surviving digital cross-connect nodes are caused to converge to an agreement on the topology (i.e., what is up and what is down). Second, based on the agreed topology and on a precomputed plan for that topology, the digital cross-connect nodes are reconfigured to restore as much call-carrying capacity as possible. The modularity of this approach comes from separating the problem of devising a distributed fault-tolerant protocol to determine what the failure is from the problem of designing a network reconfiguration for that failure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.93760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/3064/00093760.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"416","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00093760.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.93760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=93760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/93760/","displayDocTitle":"Using distributed topology update and preplanned configurations to achieve trunk network survivability","volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4063007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using distributed topology update and preplanned configurations to achieve trunk network survivability","sourcePdf":"00093760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065057S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"56","articleId":"93760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":93764,"authors":[{"name":"K.T.

The choice of rooftop functions as basis functions and razor blade functions as testing functions leads to a very suitable scheme for iterative methods. A numerical example illustrating the results of the code is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00093999.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

To improve the bandwidth and the sensitivity of the radiotelescope the line feeds will be replaced with a dual-reflector feed system. A computer code is described that is based on an efficient geometrical optics (GO) ray tracing technique. The code, called the TRT code, is related to the procedure of dynamic ray tracing used in seismics, which means that the complete complex ray field amplitude (and polarization for EM waves) is traced. The code also makes use of the paraxial-ray approximation, applied by considering each individual ray as an axis. In addition to the GO analysis, the code gives asymptotic information about the diffraction losses. This is obtained by the diffraction tracing techniques of the transition region theory (TRT). The characters of the TRT code are noted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1988.94004","publicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

The array uses cavity-backed printed cross-slot array elements. The cross-slot was chosen as the radiating element because it has a low profile, very wide space angular coverage, low cost, and broad frequency coverage (1545 MHz to 1660 MHz). The beamformer consists of 19-way radial unequal power divider and eighteen 3-b diode phase shifters. The major features of the antenna system are its low profile (total array thickness of the breadboard including beamformer and supporting structure is 0.68 inches), low elevation angular coverage, and fast acquisition and tracking performance, even under fading conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00094028.png","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

By applying the conjugate gradient (iterative) method directly to solve an operator equation, an exact solution is developed of the problem to the infinite-dimensional problem in a symbolic fashion. The exact solution is attained in M steps where M is the number of independent eigenvalues of the operator in the infinite-dimensional space. From a computational point of view, the solutions for the two equations are similar (or different) depending on how the weighting function is integrated in the inner product and how the derivative operator is treated; this is a secondary point for the iterative methods. The greatest strength of the iterative method the solution of the operator equation lies in the fact that unlike matrix methods, the nature of the expansion functions (i.e. the discretized version for the unknown) can be changed at each iteration depending the desired degree of accuracy and the discretization error can be quantified at each iteration, if so desired.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/94033/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3317415","conferenceDate":"6-10 June 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The basic difference between solving an operator equation and a matrix equation by the conjugate gradient","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The basic difference between solving an operator equation and a matrix equation by the conjugate gradient","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00094033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044119S","chronDate":"6-10 June 1988","isNumber":"3074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"724","articleId":"94033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":94035,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The building blocks of this novel concept are fixed BFNs (beam-forming networks). The fixed BFNs are connected to input ports by use of VPDs (variable power dividers) or switches. Compared to other concepts, only a very small number of variable or switching components is needed. The crux of the design is the optimization of the feed excitations of each fixed sub-BFN. Each fixed sub-BFN is switched to the input port directly to generate an individual contoured beam. The same BFN is combined with another fixed BFN to generate a different footprint, the sum of the individual beams. This requires simultaneous optimization of each sub-BFN for multiple coverages. The concept has potential for a highly reconfigurable antenna. The number of theoretically available beams increases much faster than the increase of overall system complexity represented by the required variable/switchable BFN components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/94120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3317483","conferenceDate":"6-10 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable contoured beam antenna using fixed sub-beam forming networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable contoured beam antenna using fixed sub-beam forming networks","confLoc":"Syracuse, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00094120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036261S","chronDate":"6-10 June 1988","isNumber":"3074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"724","citationCount":"2","articleId":"94120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":94189,"authors":[{"name":"W.V.

The authors focus on two of the advantages of aperture-coupled patch antennas: the aperture-coupling feed scheme eliminates the soldering process required to secure a pin connecting the feed circuit to the patch, as is necessary in fabricating the conventional probe-fed patch antenna; this can greatly reduce the complexity in constructing large patch arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of elements; and the ground plane sandwiched between the feed circuitry and the radiating patch can prevent the radiation from the feed network from interfering with the patch radiation pattern.

The antenna portion of the DBF system consists of a 2*4 array of microstrip patch elements. The patch radiators are corner-fed square elements with a diagonal slot for circular polarization designed at 2.95 GHz in Duroid. The signal is split into I (inphase) and Q (quadrature phase) channels, and each channel is converted into a digital signal by an 8-b A/D (analog-to-digital) converter at a 5 MHz rate. The I and Q channels of each element are multiplied by an 8-b weight vector. The results of the I multiplications and Q multiplications are separately summed and then detected and converted to a DC voltage output proportional to the input received signal level. Numerous different patterns were obtained by varying the I and Q weight vectors appropriately. The experimental and theoretical patterns of a flat-top-beam and a difference pattern obtained by inverting the phase of half of the array are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1988.94337","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

The author defines those parameters that are common to any MBA system. Results are presented of parametric studies in which the lenses are assumed to be simple apertures with ideal transducers that convert the spherical wavefront from the feed into a plane wave without introducing any aberrations. An 18 in. diameter zoned dielectric lens for a 271 beam MBA was fabricated and tested with a Potter feed horn, both with and without resistive tapering. Measurements of its on-axis radiation patterns and gain show that they are correctly predicted by the aperture theory used for optimization. These results indicate that optimum dimensions for a lens or reflector MBA may be determined through straightforward analytic techniques and the use of the parametric curves.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1988.94339","publicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

Individual components of the beamforming system are discussed. Topics covered include receiver modules, I/Q generation, calibration/array alignment, and the technique used for monitoring quality and integrity of digitized array data. The subject of system drift is addressed by comparing single-source receive patterns taken at various times. RF isolation is demonstrated using IF spectral plots computed from digitized receiver module data. In addition, single-source receive patterns for various arrival angles are presented. The experimental data is used to illustrate the performance of a DBF array in two rather important application areas, namely, spatial analysis for source detection and localization and adaptive nulling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1988.94360","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 IEEE AP-S.

Therefore, techniques to extract the information and produce appropriate models are desirable. In this study, multichannel EMG signal comparison by the linear prediction method is proposed. Estimation of the dissimilarities between the predicted signals can be quantified in terms of the poles of the linearly predicted signal.

Fatigue indices were evaluated according to R.E. Burke et al. (1973), with stimulation parameters modified for the larger dimensions in sheep. Fatigue indices were calculated after 2, 4, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min. After 2 min, submaximal multichannel stimulation resulted in at least 14% less muscle fatigue compared to single-channel stimulation. Accordingly, after prolonged stimulation up to 60 min, higher contraction forces were recorded at multichannel stimulation. The fatigue indices were 0.43 for single-channel and 0.66 for multichannel stimulation. The data clearly indicate that multichannel stimulation results in 23% less muscle fatigue.

A feature extraction stage inspects each EEG channel for spikelike occurrences on the basis of parameters such as duration, amplitude, and sharpness.

The results of a preliminary pilot trial of the PC-based system are reported. In an analysis of EEGs from five patients, epileptiform events were detected in all EEGs with epileptiform activity. Most missed events were due to failure to detect sufficient coincident spikes in the first pass because the spikes were of very low amplitude or there were bursts of muscle artifact.

Both sets of data were taken from an anesthetized patient about to undergo cardiac surgery.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1989.96581","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00096581.png","startPage":"2034","endPage":"2035 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Images of the Twenty-First Century.

Consequently, its drive requirements are minimal and the windings are simple. This is achieved through the elimination of the additional semiconductor switch(es) normally required for regeneration. Energy stored in the phase windings during conduction time is partially dissipated in a resistor, while the rest is converted to mechanical power. A complete steady-state analysis of the drive is given, including the input filter parameters. Closed-form expressions for determining the current and voltage stresses on the semiconducting devices are derived and cast in normalized form for use in selecting the ratings of the power devices.

It is shown that with the allowable switching combinations, six output voltage space vectors with varying amplitudes can be obtained, in addition to the zero vector. The variation is compensated by adapting the standard modulation technique. The technique permits space vector synthesis of a three-phase, nonsymmetrical, nonsinusoidal output voltage, even under non-steady-state conditions, which is essential for the control of AC servo drives. A detailed explanation of the modulator principles and the switch control as well as simulation results for the time- and frequency domain analysis is given.

This converter topology has an advantage over the conventional SRC in that no energy is returned to the source; therefore, the peak current drawn from the source is limited and the power dissipation in the source impedances in practice is avoided. To verify the analytical results, a two-output power supply is designed and tested. The problem of cross regulation in the two outputs is solved by using a nonlinear inductor as a switch in one of the output circuits.

If a known object is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise, then the matched filter maximizes the output signal-to-noise ratio. The main drawback of the matched filter in two dimensions is its sensitivity to object shifts, rotation,, and scaling, especially in the presence of additive colored Gaussian noise of unknown covariance. These problems have been overcome by using higher-order statistics (HOS). The zero lag of the triple correlation of the matched filter output has been computed and compared with zero. Since the triple correlation of a Gaussian process is zero, it has been shown that this statistic will peak if the object is present. A detection algorithm that exploits all the output samples of a single matched filter has been developed. Rotation and scaling invariance have been incorporated by transforming the Cartesian coordinates of the image and the templates into log-polar coordinates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MDSP.1989.97005","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097005.png","publicationTitle":"Sixth Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop,","startPage":"32","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDSP.1989.97005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3082","pdfPath":"/iel2/875/3082/00097005.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop,","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Matched filters","Filtering","Higher order statistics","Additive white noise","Signal to noise ratio","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Gaussian processes","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","computerised picture processing","correlation methods","filtering and prediction theory","random noise","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation invariance","image Cartesian coordinates","object detection/classification","higher-order statistics","additive colored Gaussian noise","zero lag","triple correlation","matched filter output","log-polar coordinates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Object detection and classification using matched filtering and higher-order statistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97005/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3763709","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object detection and classification using matched filtering and higher-order statistics","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00097005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038168S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","isNumber":"3082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"875","citationCount":"12","articleId":"97005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":97027,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

A new class of orthogonal basis functions that can be relevant to signal processing has recently been introduced. These bases are constructed from a single smooth bandpass function psi (t), the wavelet, by considering its translates and dilates on a dyadic grid 2/sup n/, 2/sup n/m of points, psi /sub n,m/(t)=2/sup -n/2/ psi (2/sup -n/t-m). It is required that psi (t) be well localized in both the time and frequency domain, without violating the uncertainty principle. Any one-dimensional signal can be represented by the bidimensional set of its expansion coefficients. Multidimensional signals can also be expanded in terms of wavelet bases. An algorithm for computing the expansion coefficients of a signal in terms of wavelet bases has been found, the structure of which is that of a pruned-tree quadrature mirror multirate filter bank.

A novel scheme for image compression is proposed. Wavelet transform is used to obtain a set of orthonormal subclasses of images. Wavelets are functions that allow the construction of an orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R). The wavelet functions are well localized both in the space and frequency domains. The original image is decomposed on this orthonormal basis with a pyramidal algorithm architecture using quadrature mirror filters. This classification approach separates images (vectors) into perceptually distinct classes and thus matches the visual system model. The wavelet coefficients of each class are then vector quantized. The algorithm is based on a clustering approach and on the minimization of a distortion measure such as mean-squared error (MSE).

A focusing technique that can reduce each wideband interferer in multigroup scenarios to essentially a rank-one representation without preliminary estimates of the group locations has been developed. The method is based on adjusting the spatial sampling rate or spatially resampling the array outputs, as a function of temporal frequency. Resampling has the effect of rescaling the spatial frequency axis at each temporal frequency. For proper focusing, the rescaling factors are selected so that the spatial frequency of each wideband arrival in the resampled sequences is the same for all temporal frequencies in the receiver band. A linear shift-variant transformation that can perform the required resampling operation has been designed. The array gain of the focused minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer has been compared with its fully adaptive counterpart in some common broadband interference-dominated scenarios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MDSP.1989.97067","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097067.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop,","pdfPath":"/iel2/875/3082/00097067.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDSP.1989.97067","publicationTitle":"Sixth Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop,","startPage":"117","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focussed partially adaptive broadband beamforming via spatial resampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Focussed partially adaptive broadband beamforming via spatial resampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97067/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3763763","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focussed partially adaptive broadband beamforming via spatial resampling","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00097067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072458S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","isNumber":"3082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"875","articleId":"97067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97090,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Five samples with x values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 and barrier thicknesses from 35 to 95 AA were studied. Within this range, the authors find that the electroabsorption is not very sensitive to the barrier thickness, but that the ionization field of the excitons approximately doubles for an increase of x from 0.2 to 0.4. The samples with high, thick barriers have lower internal quantum efficiencies than those with low, thin barriers. It was found that the exciton saturation intensity increases with increasing applied field, and decreasing barrier thickness or height. Time-resolved electroabsorption measurements confirm the variation in sweep-out rates between samples, and indicate that the escape mechanism at low field is probably a thermally-assisted tunneling process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.97272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3086/00097272.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097272.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.97272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum well carrier sweep out: relation to electroabsorption and exciton saturation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Excitons","Switches","Tunneling","Senior members","Ionization","Thermionic emission","Helium","Carrier confinement","Potential well","Stark effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","electroabsorption","excitons","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","optical saturation","semiconductor quantum wells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum well carrier sweep out","time resolved measurements","semiconductors","electroabsorption","exciton saturation","barrier design","sweep-out times","barrier thicknesses","ionization field","lower internal quantum efficiencies","saturation intensity","applied field","escape mechanism","thermally-assisted tunneling process","35 to 95 AA","GaAs-Al/sub x/Ga/sub 1-x/As"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Quantum well carrier sweep out: relation to electroabsorption and exciton saturation","volume":"27","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4078730","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97272/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum well carrier sweep out: relation to electroabsorption and exciton saturation","sourcePdf":"00097272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075745S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"266","articleId":"97272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":97280,"authors":[{"name":"P.V.

During nonlinear propagation of a continuous-wave (CW) dual-frequency signal through a fiber with effective amplification, a train of practically noninteracting fundamental solitons is formed. It is shown that the effective amplification can be achieved as in usual fibers with an actual amplification as well as in fibers with nonuniform parameters along the fiber axis. The method is demonstrated experimentally. Dual-frequency 25 ps pulses at lambda =1.55 mu m are reshaped into 0.2 THz combs of 0.49 ps solitons in fiber with slowly decreasing dispersion.

Moreover, this synchronous interpretation allows it to be compiled into an efficient sequential program. The LUSTRE formalism is very similar to temporal logics. This allows the language to be used for both writing programs and expressing program properties, which results in an original program verification methodology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097300.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3087","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/3087/00097300.pdf","doi":"10.1109/5.97300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.97300","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The synchronous data flow programming language LUSTRE","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97300/","displayDocTitle":"The synchronous data flow programming language LUSTRE","isJournal":true,"volume":"79","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4058947","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The synchronous data flow programming language LUSTRE","sourcePdf":"00097300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065964S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"3087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"875","articleId":"97300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":97301,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Designed to provide safe real time system programming, the SIGNAL language is based on synchronous principles. Its semantics are defined via a mathematical model of multiple-clocked flows of data and events. SIGNAL programs describe relations on such objects, so that it is possible to program a real time application via constraints. The compiler calculates the solutions of the system and thus can be used as a proof system. The equational approach is a natural way to derive multiprocessor executions of a program. This approach uses a graphical interface of a block-diagram style, and the system is illustrated on a speech recognition application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.97301","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1336","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/3087/00097301.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097301.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.97301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programming real-time applications with SIGNAL","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Mathematical model","Equations","Speech recognition","Digital filters","Program processors","Signal design","Real time systems","Plasma welding","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel languages","program compilers","real-time systems","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SIGNAL language","compiler","real time system programming","synchronous principles","multiple-clocked flows","proof system","equational approach","multiprocessor executions","graphical interface","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Programming real-time applications with SIGNAL","volume":"79","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4058948","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97301/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programming real-time applications with SIGNAL","sourcePdf":"00097301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032294S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"3087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"273","articleId":"97301","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97325,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The calibration targets include a flat plate, a dihedral corner reflector, and a rotated dihedral corner reflector. The rotation angle of the third calibrator can be derived in the calibration process and used to verify the calibration performance. Experimental results show that the calculated rotation angle of the third calibrator over the operation bandwidth is in good agreement with its actual angle, hence it provides a self-consistent parameter of the calibration algorithm. Based on the signal-to-noise consideration, an optimal rotation angle for a dihedral corner reflector is found to be 22.5 degrees . This calibration technique is also useful in characterizing the frequency and polarization responses of dual-polarization antennas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","volume":"39","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4073752","displayDocTitle":"A new calibration algorithm of wide-band polarimetric measurement system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new calibration algorithm of wide-band polarimetric measurement system","sourcePdf":"00097354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042493S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","articleId":"97354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":97356,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The characteristic equation for surface waves that can be supported by such saw-tooth conducting surfaces is derived.

The model considers optical feedback from the light generated in the LED, electrical feedback from the holes thermally emitted over the LED cladding layer, nonlinear gain of the HPT, the Early effect, and leakage resistance. The analysis shows that either electrical or optical feedback can be the dominant cause for the NDR, depending upon their relative strengths. The NDR observed in the devices was caused primarily by electrical feedback since the optical feedback is weak.

The source/drain regions of a switching transistor are raised by using a selective silicon growth technique. Because of lateral growth of the silicon over gate and field regions, the bitline contact can overlap the gate and field regions. The shallow source/drain junction by the raised source/drain structure realizes a reduction of gate length and isolation spacing. As a result, the DRAM memory cell area can be reduced to 37% of that using the conventional LDD MOSFET. In the fabrication of an experimental DRAM cell, a new stacked capacitor structure has been introduced to maintain enough storage capacitance, even in the small-cell area. The new capacitor is made by a simple and unique process using a cylindrical silicon-nitride sidewall layer.

The most significant phenomenon is that write-state retentivity is less dependent on the programmed depth, and is improved by reducing silicon nitride thickness. This behavior suggests that write-state charges are distributed rectangularly, while erase-state charges are distributed exponentially. The lower limit of the programming voltage is determined by write-state retentivity and not erase-state retentivity, and the write-state charge distribution depth determines the lower limit of silicon nitride thickness. The upper limit of the programming voltage is determined by erase-state retentivity after erase/write cycles. The scaling guidelines indicate that 16-Mb EEPROMs can be designed using MNOS memory devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4073796","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"New scaling guidelines for MNOS nonvolatile memory devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New scaling guidelines for MNOS nonvolatile memory devices","sourcePdf":"00097417.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037638S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"40","articleId":"97417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97424,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In a series of experiments with this system and five trained test operators covering more than 100 h of teleoperation, performance in a series of generic and application-driven tasks with and without force feedback was measured, and with control shared between teleoperation and local sensor referenced control. Measurements defining task performance include 100-Hz recording of six-axis force-torque information, task completion time, and visual observation of predefined task errors. It is shown that all performance measures improved as capability was added along a spectrum of capabilities ranging from pure position control through force-reflecting teleoperation and shared control.

The novel waveguides are constructed from dielectric materials and structures which are available in monolithic technology so that the integration of active devices is possible.

The model accounts for path loss, log-normal shadowing, Rayleigh fading, and vehicle velocity. The outage predictions are obtained by computer simulation. Various outage control techniques are evaluated, including cell sectoring, transmitter control, and hands-off. It is shown that down link power control is quite useful when hand-offs are used, and that shadowing can have a large effect on the outage predictions. The outage predictions are applied to a digital cellular system that uses quadrature differential phase shift keying (QDPSK) modulation and Reed-Solomon (RS) coding. It is shown that the performance of a coded digital cellular system is largely limited by rapidly moving vehicles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097507.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3095/00097507.pdf","doi":"10.1109/25.97507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.97507","startPage":"521","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink outage predictions for cellular radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97507/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink outage predictions for cellular radio systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4063113","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink outage predictions for cellular radio systems","sourcePdf":"00097507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03416S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","articleId":"97507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":97508,"authors":[{"name":"H.W.-H.

The approach presented is to store a precalculated bank of pilot filters and automatically select the best one as the signal-to-noise, (SNR) or vehicle speed change. The authors address the issue of adjusting the filter bandwidth as speed changes. They call this technique the filter switching algorithm. This technique can provide a 1.0 dB improvement for a normalized Doppler frequency of 2%; up to 2.0 dB can be gained when operating at a lower Doppler frequency. The algorithm is found to be very robust, in the sense that self-noise and decision direction have little effect on its operation and the resulting bit error rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.97508","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097508.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3095/00097508.pdf","startPage":"532","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.97508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive filtering technique for pilot-aided transmission systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive filtering technique for pilot-aided transmission systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4063114","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive filtering technique for pilot-aided transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00097508.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032361S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","articleId":"97508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":97509,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

The system is modeled as a frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channel corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and co-channel interference (CCI). The probability density function of the phase difference between two consecutive symbols of M-ary differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signals is first derived. In M-ary DPSK systems, the information is completely contained in this phase difference. For pi /4-DQPSK, the BER is derived in a closed form and calculated directly. Numerical results show that for the 24 kBd (48 kb/s) pi /4-DQPSK operated at a carrier frequency of 850 MHz and C/I<20 dB, the BER will be dominated by CCI if the vehicular speed is below 100 mi/h. In this derivation, frequency-selective fading is modeled by two independent Rayleigh signal paths. Only one co-channel is assumed in this derivation. The results obtained are also shown to be valid for discriminator detection of M-ary DPSK signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.97510","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097510.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3095/00097510.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.97510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error rate performance of pi /4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Bit error rate performance of pi /4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channel","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4063116","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error rate performance of pi /4-DQPSK in a frequency-selective fast Rayleigh fading channel","sourcePdf":"00097510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041493S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"55","articleId":"97510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97511,"authors":[{"name":"J.-F.

According to the results presented here, the performance of a narrowband system (<200 kHz) at 900 MHz could greatly benefit from a frequency diversity scheme provided that the separation between the two frequencies is greater than approximately 5 MHz.

In particular, the authors utilize the current estimates of the channel impulse response (CIR) at each diversity branch to compute the receiver parameters periodically. The authors propose a novel block-adaptive strategy which computes the time-varying CIR by interpolating a set of CIR estimates obtained through periodic training. Although incurring some inherent processing delay and throughput reduction, this interpolation strategy has the advantage of immunity to decision errors which would quite likely occur during a deep fade. It is shown that the system performance is limited, in the form of an irreducible bit error rate at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), by the CIR estimation of the rapidly fading channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization and diversity combining for mobile radio using interpolated channel estimates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.97518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/3095/00097518.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"645","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097518.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.97518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive equalization and diversity combining for mobile radio using interpolated channel estimates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4063124","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive equalization and diversity combining for mobile radio using interpolated channel estimates","sourcePdf":"00097518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046107S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"3095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"69","articleId":"97518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97520,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The circuit is derived from a class-E rectifier by replacing a diode with a controllable switch. It can then both rectify and regulate the rectified output against variations in DC load and amplitude of the AC input voltage. The switch consists of a transistor and an antiparallel diode or a series diode. The DC output voltage of the rectifier is regulated by varying the ON duty ratio of the switch. The AC input voltage can be at a constant or varying frequency. The controllable switch turns on and off at zero voltage with low dv/dt, reducing switching losses, stresses, and noise. Equations governing the circuit operation are derived. Experimental results at 0.5 MHz were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The rectifier can be used in high-frequency-power-density multiple-output power supplies, all of whose outputs are regulated. The frequency need not be varied to regulate the DC output.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.97536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3096","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097536.png","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1172","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3096/00097536.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.97536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class E low dv/dt synchronous rectifier with controlled duty ratio and output voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Rectifiers","Diodes","Frequency","Regulators","Switching circuits","Stress control","Voltage control","Low voltage","Zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply circuits","rectifying circuits","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous rectifier","controlled duty ratio","output voltage","DC regulator","controllable switch","DC load","AC input voltage","antiparallel diode","switching losses","circuit operation","multiple-output power supplies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Class E low dv/dt synchronous rectifier with controlled duty ratio and output voltage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4063239","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class E low dv/dt synchronous rectifier with controlled duty ratio and output voltage","sourcePdf":"00097536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037611S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"39","articleId":"97536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":97537,"authors":[{"name":"E.

RM8 is a novel approach to defining a coding standard for video communications at p*64 kb/s. Methods studied include reducing the quantizer step size, randomized scanning of the macroblock, and/or nonuniform quantization of the transform coefficients. Reducing the quantizer step size did improve the codec performance, but only marginally. Nonuniform quantization coupled with randomized scanning of the macroblocks was found to be effective in improving the image quality, both objectively and subjectively. Improvement is particularly marked in the initial 20 frames of a sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.97543","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097543.png","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.97543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3096","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3096/00097543.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of image quality for low bit rate video coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97543/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of image quality for low bit rate video coding","volume":"38","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4063246","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of image quality for low bit rate video coding","sourcePdf":"00097543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027871S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"8","articleId":"97543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":97547,"authors":[{"name":"S.-S.

This current density image is created by measuring the magnetic field arising from these currents and taking its curl. These magnetic fields are proportional to the phase component of a complex magnetic resonance image. Measurements of all three components of a quasistatic nonuniform current density in a phantom are described. Expected current density calculations from a numerical solution for the magnetic field which was created by the phantom are presented for comparison. The results of a numerical simulation of the experiment, which used this field solution and which included the effects of slice selection and sampling, are also presented. The experimental and simulated results are quantitatively compared.

The subtraction is carried out using two sets of data: one set is acquired with a main window centered at photopeak energy and the other is acquired with two subwindows on both sides of the main window. The scattered photons included in the main window are estimated from the counts acquired with the subwindows and then they are subtracted from the count acquired with the main windows. Since the subtraction is performed at each pixel in each planar image, the proposed method has the potential to be more precise than conventional methods. For three different activity distributions in cylinder phantoms, simulation tests gave good agreement between the activity distributions reconstructed from unscattered photons and those from the corrected data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.97591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.97591","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3098/00097591.pdf","startPage":"408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical method for position-dependent Compton-scatter correction in single photon emission CT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97591/","displayDocTitle":"A practical method for position-dependent Compton-scatter correction in single photon emission CT","volume":"10","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4062409","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18222843","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical method for position-dependent Compton-scatter correction in single photon emission CT","sourcePdf":"00097591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066334S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"3098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"429","articleId":"97591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97598,"authors":[{"name":"J.I.

This hidden layer is then backprojected to form an image as the network output. The learning algorithm adjusts the weighting coefficients using a backpropagation algorithm which minimizes the mean squared error between the ideal training image and the reconstructed training image. The response of the trained network to an impulse projection resembles the ramp filter typically used with backprojection, and reconstructed images are similar to filtered backprojection images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.97600","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/3098/00097600.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"487","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097600.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.97600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial neural network for SPECT image reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","displayDocTitle":"An artificial neural network for SPECT image reconstruction","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4062418","pubMedId":"18222852","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial neural network for SPECT image reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00097600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029324S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"3098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"32","articleId":"97600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":97619,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Performance comparisons on integrated circuit bus crossing problems show that for problems with as few as 12 conductors the multipole accelerated boundary element method can be nearly 500 times faster than Gaussian-elimination-based algorithms, and five to ten times faster than the iterative method alone, depending on required accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097624.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/3099/00097624.pdf","startPage":"1447","endPage":"1459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.97624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.97624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FastCap: a multipole accelerated 3-D capacitance extraction program","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Capacitance","Conductors","Iterative algorithms","Computational geometry","Dielectrics","Integral equations","Boundary element methods","Gaussian processes","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-elements methods","capacitance","circuit analysis computing","integral equations","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BEM acceleration algorithm","3D geometry","IC bus crossing problems","capacitance extraction program","fast algorithm","three-dimensional geometry","ideal conductors","uniform dielectric","capacitance extractor","boundary-element technique","integral equation","conjugate residual iterative algorithm","multipole approximation","multiconductor capacitance calculations","integrated circuit bus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"FastCap: a multipole accelerated 3-D capacitance extraction program","volume":"10","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4078020","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FastCap: a multipole accelerated 3-D capacitance extraction program","sourcePdf":"00097624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057347S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"622","articleId":"97624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":97625,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Among the analytically determined properties are the Gaussian probability densities of the three components of the dispersion vector, and the hyperbolic secant (soliton shaped) probability densities of the components of the derivative of the dispersion vector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.97630","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3100/00097630.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1456","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097630.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.97630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical theory of polarization dispersion in single mode fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97630/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical theory of polarization dispersion in single mode fibers","volume":"9","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4092751","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical theory of polarization dispersion in single mode fibers","sourcePdf":"00097630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042121S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"342","articleId":"97630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97635,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

By segmenting this large problem into a number of smaller problems, the simulation region can be shrunk to a small area containing only the details of the rough-surface mirror. By launching the incident wave judiciously, the computation time grows linearly with the length of the mirror. A farfield transformation of the calculated time-domain scattered field yields forward-reflected and back-reflected powers. The computer time needed to analyze this large turning-mirror system is reduced to about 3 min of CRAY time, compared to several hours for a brute-force approach using a full mesh.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of rough-surface effects in an optical turning mirror using the finite-difference time-domain method","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.97635","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/3100/00097635.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1480","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097635.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.97635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of rough-surface effects in an optical turning mirror using the finite-difference time-domain method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4092755","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of rough-surface effects in an optical turning mirror using the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00097635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054033S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","articleId":"97635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":97649,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

A ladder network of resistances/capacitances represents the cable out to the outer surface of the pipe.

The heat input to the system is conductor I/sup 2/R loss. The heat input can be a periodic signal or a transient of up to 300 h. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to obtain heat input in the frequency domain. The frequency domain thermal input at the conductor is divided by the thermal admittance seen by the conductor and an inverse FFT is used to obtain conductor temperature as a function of time. A similar procedure obtains shield and pipe temperature. Iteration is used to model conductor electrical resistance change with temperature.

Each boost type PWM HVDC converter is presented as a black box. It is shown how the black boxes can tie several independent AC utility systems, together through a multiterminal DC grid which facilitates power exchanges. On the AC side, the converter station has active controls over: (1) the voltage amplitude, (2) the voltage angle, and (3) the frequency. On the DC side, parallel connections facilitate multiterminal load sharing by simple local controls so that redundant communication channels are not required. Bidirectional power through each station is accomplished by the reversal of the direction of DC current flow.

Consequently, the ratings of these components are substantially lower than for similarly rated resonant topologies. While resonant elements are used to ensure zero voltage switching of all devices, they have little or no role in the actual power transfer and can thus be reasonably sized. As the resonant elements are not involved in the primary power transfer, the converter is referred to as a pseudo-resonant converter. It is shown that the converter offers significantly higher levels of performance than either the pulse width-modulated (PWM) or typical resonant converters. Operation at very high frequencies is possible and is shown with the fabrication of a 200 W 1 MHz DC-DC converter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.97767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/3102/00097767.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097767.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.97767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudo-resonant full bridge DC/DC converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97767/","displayDocTitle":"Pseudo-resonant full bridge DC/DC converter","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4074596","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudo-resonant full bridge DC/DC converter","sourcePdf":"00097767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052192S","chronDate":"Oct.  1991","isNumber":"3102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"192","articleId":"97767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97771,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Thus, the amplitude of the optical pulse train is modulated by the (relatively) low-frequency envelop of a few gigahertz under this condition. This observation was obtained by simultaneously measuring the pulsewidth using an autocorrelator and monitoring the optical intensity using a high-speed photodiode and a microwave spectrum analyzer. It is concluded that while it is possible to generate picosecond optical pulses in ultrahigh-frequency mode-locking of quantum-well lasers, very short pulses ( to 1 ps) are almost always accompanied by self-pulsation which is manifested as low-frequency (gigahertz) envelope modulation of the optical pulse train.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.97831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3105/00097831.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.97831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3105","startPage":"974","endPage":"976","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097831.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition for short pulse generation in ultrahigh frequency mode-locking of semiconductor lasers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Condition for short pulse generation in ultrahigh frequency mode-locking of semiconductor lasers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97831/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4089588","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition for short pulse generation in ultrahigh frequency mode-locking of semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"00097831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038621S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"41","articleId":"97831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97837,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When plotting maximum amplification versus the 980 luminescence on a logarithmic scale, the slope was approximately -2 irrespective of the host material. The validity of the assumed two-particle upconversion model up to 4 mW of pump power is shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.97839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","startPage":"996","endPage":"998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3105/00097839.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097839.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.97839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concentration-dependent upconversion in Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifiers: Experiments and modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Optical fiber cables","Telecommunications","Fluorescence","Photonics","Artificial intelligence","Silicon compounds","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Doped fiber amplifiers","Stationary state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","erbium","fibre lasers","germanium compounds","optical pumping","phosphorus compounds","population inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concentration dependent upconversion","Er concentration","Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifiers","computer model","two-particle upconversion","upconversion coefficient","rate-equation model","amplification reduction","parasitic upconversion","maximum amplification","luminescence","host material","pump power","4 MW","GeO/sub 2/:Er/sup 3+/","GeO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-P/sub 2/O/sub 5/:Er/sup 3+/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Concentration-dependent upconversion in Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifiers: Experiments and modeling","volume":"3","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4089596","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97839/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concentration-dependent upconversion in Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifiers: Experiments and modeling","sourcePdf":"00097839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033892S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"127","articleId":"97839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97840,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This scheme uses the gradient projection optimization method in the framework of resolved motion rate control and does not require calculation of the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian. An efficient formulation for determining joint velocities for given Cartesian components of linear and angular end-effector velocities is obtained. This control scheme is well suited for real-time implementation, which is essential if the end-effector trajectory is continuously modified based on sensory feedback. Implementation of this scheme on a Motorola 6820 VME bus-based controller of the 7-DOF manipulator is described.

A suitable kinetostatic formulation for multiple cooperating arms is adopted that allows a global task space description of external and internal forces as well as absolute and relative velocities at the object level. The concept of a force manipulability ellipsoid for a single arm is formally extended to the multi-arm case by regarding the whole system as a mechanical transformer from the extended joint space to the global task space. Kinetostatic duality properties are then exploited to derive velocity manipulability ellipsoids for the multiple-arm system. The proposed method is compared with other approaches using numerical examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4058502","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Global task space manipulability ellipsoids for multiple-arm systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global task space manipulability ellipsoids for multiple-arm systems","sourcePdf":"00097880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064007S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"144","articleId":"97880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":97883,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.V.

The authors deal with two problems: the visit problem and the terrain model acquisition problem. In the visit problem, the robot is required to visit a sequence of destination points, and in the terrain model acquisition problem, the robot is required to acquire the complete model of the terrain.

A simple closed-form expression for contention in buffered, direct networks is derived and found to agree closely with simulations. The model includes the effects of packet size and communication locality. Network analysis under various constraints and under different workload parameters reveals that performance is highly sensitive to these constraints and workloads. A two-dimensional network is shown to have the lowest latency only when switch delays and network contention are ignored; three- or four-dimensional networks are favored otherwise. If communication locality exists, two-dimensional networks regain their advantage. Communication locality decreases both the base network latency and the network bandwidth requirements of applications. It is shown that a much larger fraction of the resulting performance improvement arises from the reduction in bandwidth requirements than from the decrease in latency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/3107/00097897.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097897.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.97897","doi":"10.1109/71.97897","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97897","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Delay","Switches","Communication switching","Wire","Performance analysis","Bandwidth","Concurrent computing","Multiprocessing systems","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffered networks","interconnection network performance","latency","direct networks","wire delays","closed-form expression","packet size","communication locality","two-dimensional network","switch delays","network contention","four-dimensional networks","network bandwidth requirements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Limits on interconnection network performance","accessionNumber":"4065070","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limits on interconnection network performance","sourcePdf":"00097897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03282S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"349","articleId":"97897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":97902,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Therefore, dependences extracted from a loop nest must be lexicographically positive. This leads to a simple test for legality of compound transformations: any code transformation that leaves the dependences lexicographically positive is legal. The loop transformation theory is applied to the problem of maximizing the degree of coarse- or fine-grain parallelism in a loop nest. It is shown that the maximum degree of parallelism can be achieved by transforming the loops into a nest of coarsest fully permutable loop nests and wavefronting the fully permutable nests. The canonical form of coarsest fully permutable nests can be transformed mechanically to yield maximum degrees of coarse- and/or fine-grain parallelism. The efficient heuristics can find the maximum degrees of parallelism for loops whose nesting level is less than five.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.97902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/3107/00097902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.97902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3107","startPage":"452","endPage":"471","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097902.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A loop transformation theory and an algorithm to maximize parallelism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=97902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A loop transformation theory and an algorithm to maximize parallelism","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4065075","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A loop transformation theory and an algorithm to maximize parallelism","sourcePdf":"00097902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047243S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"382","articleId":"97902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":97903,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Accuracy is comparable to that for the nearest-neighbor algorithm, which is slower and requires more storage space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3963659","pubMedId":"18282856","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast training algorithms for multilayer neural nets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast training algorithms for multilayer neural nets","sourcePdf":"00097911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057757S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"3108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"122","articleId":"97911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":97912,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The method avoids disadvantages of other existing methods by parametrizing a set of component densities from which the actual densities are constructed. The parameters of the component densities are optimized by a self-organizing algorithm, reducing to a minimum the labeling of design samples. All the required computations are realized with the simple sum-of-product units commonly used in connectionist models. The density approximations produced by the method are illustrated in two dimensions for a multispectral image classification task. The practical use of the method is illustrated by a small speech recognition problem.

Intrafield codes are introduced, some of which can be implemented with fewer than 1 multiplier per 100 pixels. These codes have a great advantage in a bandlimited TV environment over alternative error-control methods requiring no redundancy, since they depend on prefiltering of the image. The primary implementation cost is, therefore, that of intrafield processors at the source and receiver. These processors consist primarily of a field store and of simple arithmetic units implementing vertical line (comb). filtering. In the optimal filters discussed, most coefficients are +or-1's. An application to compatible coding of TV signals for control of impulse errors in NTSC signals is presented. The emphasis is on encoding by vertical filtering and burst error estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/76.97989","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00097989.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/3112/00097989.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.97989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image filtering with orthogonal projectors for burst error control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/97989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Image filtering with orthogonal projectors for burst error control","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4058830","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image filtering with orthogonal projectors for burst error control","sourcePdf":"00097989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051083S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"2","articleId":"97989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":97995,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

By imposing some mild constraints on sample location in the 2-D frequency plane, the method always provides a unique design solution. Important characteristics of the method are design flexibility through the use of nonuniform samples and computational efficiency. This method is compared with the uniform sampling, inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) approach and also with a general method for filter design called arbitrary sampling. The method presented is shown to require much less computation than the arbitrary sampling approach, which may lead to possible degenerate cases where there is no unique solution for the filter.

With three buses, the bus bandwidth equals the input data rate. A single time-multiplexed bus with a bandwidth of three times the input data rate can alternatively be used.

When fewer correlations are known than would be necessary to specify such an eigenvector, it is natural to choose a signal which is robust to the implied uncertainty in the noise dependency structure. This is shown to be tantamount to finding a tight upper bound on the minimum eigenvalue over all correlation matrices within the uncertainty class. Such a bound is achieved by the reduced correlation matrix of order equal to the number of available correlations, and hence the robust signal is shown to have this length. No matter how reasonable, any assumption used to extend the correlation matrix can degrade performance; a system designer should not try to use information that is not available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/98015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","volume":"39","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4100664","displayDocTitle":"Robust signal selection for the matched filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust signal selection for the matched filter","sourcePdf":"00098015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031835S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","articleId":"98015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":98032,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In some process situations, however, the use of a non-linear control strategy may impart operational advantages. In this contribution a new formulation of a non-linear predictive controller is proposed. The algorithm follows a model based approach where the nominal model for control algorithm synthesis is an artificial neural network. This type of model structure can be considered generic in the sense that little prior knowledge of the process is required. Unlike other commonly used black box approaches, a neural network based process model has the potential to describe more concisely the behaviour of complex process dynamics. Results are presented from application of the artificial neural network based controller to an exothermic chemical reactor and binary distillation column.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/1215/3117/00098459.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"271 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Control 1991.

Both the first and second order statistics of the envelope distribution are satisfied by this mathematical-modelling-oriented algorithm. The simulator provides user-selectable radio channel parameters with dual outputs providing Rayleigh plus log-normal fading and having a 52 dB dynamic range over a 500 MHz to 2 GHz usable RF bandwidth.

With the power supply adjusted to assure hot-electron reliability, the 25-ns 4-Mb low-temperature (LT) chips operated 3 times faster than conventional chips. The LT-optimized chips functioned properly with cycle times as fast as 45 ns, and with a toggle-mode data rate of 667 Mb/s. Wide operating margins and a very large process window for data retention were demonstrated. At a temperature of 85 K the storage retention time of the trench-capacitor memory cells exceeded 8 h.

The speed limitations of the conventional DRAM sensing technique are discussed, and the advantages of using the direct bit-line sensing technique are explained. A direct bit-line sensing technique with a two-stage amplifier is described. One readout amplifier is composed of a two-stage current-mirror amplifier and a selected readout amplifier is activated by a column decoder output before the selected word line rises. The amplifier then detects a small bit-line signal appearing on a bit-line pair immediately after the word-line rise. This two-stage amplification scheme is essential to improving access time, especially in the case of a CMOS process. The high sensitivity of the readout amplifier is discussed, and the electrical features and characteristics of the fabricated DRAM are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","CMOS process","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Decoding","CMOS technology","Microprocessors","Timing","Read-write memory","Semiconductor device measurement","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS DRAM","nonaddress-multiplexed","dynamic RAM","direct bit-line sensing","two-stage amplifier","readout amplifier","current-mirror amplifier","column decoder output","access time","4 Mbit","17 ns"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=98969","doi":"10.1109/4.98969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3123/00098969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.98969","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 17-ns 4-Mb CMOS DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 17-ns 4-Mb CMOS DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/98969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","volume":"26","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4088239","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 17-ns 4-Mb CMOS DRAM","sourcePdf":"00098969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045525S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"98969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":98970,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the past, it was assumed that simultaneous switching noise created by CMOS outputs was directly proportional to the number of outputs switching simultaneously. Recent studies indicate that CMOS circuits exhibit sublinear behavior (due to the negative feedback influence) of power/ground noise (or bounce) as a function of the number of outputs switching simultaneously. Detailed electrical models, equations, and a trial architecture for calculating the switching noise are included. The results are compared to SPICE simulations and conventional power/ground noise calculations. The behavior of simultaneous switching noise as a function of constant-voltage (CV) device scaling is explained for small-geometry CMOS output drivers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/3123/00098995.pdf","startPage":"1724","endPage":"1728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.98995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.98995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=98995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous switching ground noise calculation for packaged CMOS devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Circuit noise","Driver circuits","Feedback circuits","Negative feedback","Switching circuits","Semiconductor device modeling","Equations","SPICE","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous switching ground noise","calculation","ground bounce","packaged CMOS devices","internal switching current","output driver switching current","simultaneous switching noise","CMOS outputs","sublinear behavior","negative feedback influence","electrical models","trial architecture","SPICE simulations","power/ground noise calculations","device scaling","small-geometry CMOS output drivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/98995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous switching ground noise calculation for packaged CMOS devices","volume":"26","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4088265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous switching ground noise calculation for packaged CMOS devices","sourcePdf":"00098995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034997S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"160","articleId":"98995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":99034,"authors":[{"name":"N.

These results are compared with the local plane-slab approximation described by G. Tricoles (1964). Errors <1% in magnitude are found for radii of curvature >10 lambda /sub 0/, and thickness <1% lambda /sub 0/. For the extreme case of shells with radii <5 lambda /sub 0/ and thickness greater than 1 lambda /sub 0/, the plane-slab approximation appears to have significant error. Typically, for a shell of radius 5 lambda /sub 0/ and thickness of 1 lambda /sub 0/, the error in the normalized far field is less than 4%. The procedure of P.D. Einziger and L.B.

This technique is computationally more efficient than the 'brute force' (or ordinary) FDTD approach, which must use cells small enough to resolve the dielectric sheets. Numerical results are presented which show that this technique yields accurate scattering results at a large savings in computational resources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/3125/00099042.pdf","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.99042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.99042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of thin dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Slabs","Electromagnetic scattering","Maxwell equations","Integral equations","Dielectric materials","Helium","Magnetic fields","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["difference equations","electromagnetic wave scattering","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic scattering","modelling","thin dielectric structures","finite-difference time-domain technique","conductor-backed dielectric sheets","smart cell technique","crack widths","FDTD approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of thin dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain technique","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4078652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of thin dielectric structures using the finite-difference time-domain technique","sourcePdf":"00099042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053436S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","articleId":"99042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":99047,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two antenna nulling schemes that can be used with frequency hopping to reduce the follower jammer threat are described. One of the schemes is only effective with uncorrelated signals. The second scheme is designed for coping with correlated jamming. Both schemes capitalize on the arrival time differences of the desired signal and the interference to isolate the interference for cancellation. The fast converging sample matrix inversion algorithm is considered in both schemes for improved effectiveness. The performance of the antenna nulling schemes, described in terms of the array output-signal-to-interference and noise ratio (OSINR), is evaluated by computer simulation. The OSINR of the array at a single frequency in the hop-set is presented for a range of desired signal-to-noise and jammer-to-noise ratios.

Another approach is to design the amplifier in such a way that the feedthrough of high isolation mode voltage remains negligible. It is shown that an eight-channel isolation amplifier with a very good isolation mode rejection ratio can be built with commercially available components, provided that special attention is paid to the shielding of the amplifier inputs.

A predictive block-matching motion estimation scheme was implemented for efficient video code design. The scheme is based on the so-called inertia effect of natural video scenes and takes advantage of the motion vectors obtained in the previous frames. The benefits from this prediction process are threefold. First, the searching area is greatly reduced, and so is the computational complexity. Second, the motion vector overhead information is reduced since motion vectors are decorrelated by the prediction process. Finally, the motion vectors estimated from this procedure are more realistic since it reflects the real physical phenomena. These advantages were also demonstrated by simulation results including the coded data rate, displaced frame difference entropy, motion vectors, and reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio. Only a simple prediction model was implemented; further results in more general autoregressive (AR) modes are still under study.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.99095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/3127/00099095.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00099095.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.99095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive block-matching motion estimation for TV coding.

The walls are assumed to be good conductors. Loss is only applied to the current component that flows axially along the slot walls, which is generally the dominant component for slots that are long and narrow. The first method modifies an FDTD equation internal to the slot to include a surface-impedance contribution. This method is appropriate for the usual FDTD thin-slot formalisms. The second method includes the losses into a half-space integral equation that can be used by the recently introduced hybrid thin-slot algorithm.

By computing the channel capacity and the associated throughput, a simple hard decision receiver is shown to perform much better than a receiver using perfect side-information to erase the symbols transmitted on hops that were hit when all the users have the same power and one binary symbol is transmitted per hop.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.99146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/3130/00099146.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.99146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3130","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability of error in frequency-hop spread-spectrum multiple-access communication systems with noncoherent reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probability of error in frequency-hop spread-spectrum multiple-access communication systems with noncoherent reception","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99146/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4057148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability of error in frequency-hop spread-spectrum multiple-access communication systems with noncoherent reception","sourcePdf":"00099146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054532S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"3130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"99146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":99156,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.F.

This design technique effectively doubles the applicable frequency range of standard bi-phase SC filters. In practice, the particular nonideal properties of the double-sampling scheme result mainly in parasitic sidebands in the output spectrum. The DSS design technique is described, and a spectral analysis of double-sampling SC filters, including the nonideal properties, is given. With these results, the precise specifications for the pre- (anti-aliasing) and postfilter are derived. An excellent match between the analytical description and experimental results is found for a linear fifth-order elliptic double-sampling SC low-pass filter designed for video frequency applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Active filters","Decision support systems","Clocks","Frequency","Low pass filters","Charge transfer","Sampling methods","Circuits","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","ladder networks","low-pass filters","network synthesis","spectral analysis","switched capacitor filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear fifth order filter","ladder filters","elliptic filter","prefilter","HF type","double-sampling","switched-capacitor filters","design technique","high-frequency","spectral analysis","SC filters","nonideal properties","anti-aliasing","postfilter","low-pass filter","video frequency applications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/31.99156","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00099156.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/3131/00099156.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.99156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral analysis of double-sampling switched-capacitor filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectral analysis of double-sampling switched-capacitor filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99156/","volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4078782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral analysis of double-sampling switched-capacitor filters","sourcePdf":"00099156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03837S","chronDate":"Nov 1991","isNumber":"3131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"21","articleId":"99156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":99157,"authors":[{"name":"N.-C.

The proposed strategy uses a two-level hierarchical control by partitioning the interconnection structure of a distributed or multiprocessor system into independent symmetric regions (spheres) centered at some control points. The central points, called schedulers, optimally schedule tasks within their spheres and maintain state information with low overhead. The authors consider interconnection structures belonging to a number of families of distance transitive graphs for evaluation, and, using their algebraic characteristics, show that identification of spheres and their scheduling points is in general an NP-complete problem. An efficient solution for this problem is presented by making exclusive use of a combinatorial structure known as the Hadamard matrix. The performance of the proposed strategy has been evaluated and compared with an efficient fully distributed strategy through an extensive simulation study. The proposed strategy yielded much better results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99188/","volume":"17","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4093206","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semi-distributed load balancing for massively parallel multicomputer systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-distributed load balancing for massively parallel multicomputer systems","sourcePdf":"00099188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049402S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"58","articleId":"99188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":99198,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The process of deriving formal specifications is viewed as a problem-solving process. The system uses common problem-solving techniques such as schemas, analogy, and difference-based reasoning to derive formal specifications. If an informal description is a commonly occurring operation for which the system has a schema, then the formal specification is derived by instantiating the schema. If there is a no such schema, SPECIFIER tries to find a previously solved problem which is analogous to the current problem. If the problem found is directly analogous to the current problem, it applies an analogy mapping to obtain a formal specification. On the other hand, if the analogy found is only approximate, it solves the directly analogous part of the problem by analogy and performs difference-based reasoning using the remaining (unmatched) parts to transform the formal specification obtained by analogy to a formal specification for the entire original problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4093216","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic derivation of formal software specifications from informal descriptions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic derivation of formal software specifications from informal descriptions","sourcePdf":"00099198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053636S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"45","articleId":"99198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":99233,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These descriptors can be constructed using the methods of invariant theory, which are briefly surveyed. A range of applications of invariant descriptors in 3D model-based vision is demonstrated. First, a model-based vision system that recognizes curved plane objects irrespective of their pose is demonstrated. Curves are not reduced to polyhedral approximations but are handled as objects in their own right. Models are generated directly from image data. Once objects have been recognized, their pose can be computed. Invariant descriptors for 3D objects with plane faces are described. All these ideas are demonstrated using images of real scenes. The stability of a range of invariant descriptors to measurement error is treated in detail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.99233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3135/00099233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.99233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3135","startPage":"971","endPage":"991","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00099233.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invariant descriptors for 3D object recognition and pose","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Invariant descriptors for 3D object recognition and pose","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","accessionNumber":"4084149","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invariant descriptors for 3D object recognition and pose","sourcePdf":"00099233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049553S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"287","articleId":"99233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":99234,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is shown that for objects with sharp edges as well as with smooth bounding contours, the set of possible images of a given object is embedded in a linear space spanned by a small number of views. For objects with sharp edges, the linear combination representation is exact. For objects with smooth boundaries, it is an approximation that often holds over a wide range of viewing angles. Rigid transformations (with or without scaling) can be distinguished from more general linear transformations of the object by testing certain constraints placed on the coefficients of the linear combinations. Three alternative methods of determining the transformation that matches a model to a given image are proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.99234","startPage":"992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/3135/00099234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.99234","endPage":"1006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition by linear combinations of models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1991","displayDocTitle":"Recognition by linear combinations of models","volume":"13","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4084150","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition by linear combinations of models","sourcePdf":"00099234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039438S","chronDate":"Oct 1991","isNumber":"3135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"535","articleId":"99234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":99262,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this study, the generation dispatch problems are formulated as a multiple objective optimization problem with two noncommensurable objectives (economy and environmental impacts). Each objective is optimized by Powell's method in the light of the individual performance index. Goal programming, a powerful tool for multiple criteria decision-making, is quantitatively performed to identify trade-off relations among these conflicting objectives. After a trade-off relation has been determined, sensitivity analysis is applied to evaluate the environmental marginal cost which indicates the increased portion of the monetary cost of system operation while the impact on the environment is improved.

The developed expert system, which was implemented on a personal computer, was written in PROLOG using a 5-year database. To benefit from the expert knowledge and experience of the system operator, eleven different shapes, each with different means of load calculations, were established. With these load shapes at hand, some peculiar load characteristics pertaining to the Taiwan Power Company can be taken into account. The special load types considered by the expert system include the extremely low load levels during the week of the Chinese New Year, the special load characteristics of the days following a tropical storm or a typhoon, the partial shutdown of certain factories on Saturdays, the special event caused by a holiday on Friday or on Tuesday, etc. A characteristic feature of the knowledge-based expert system is that it is easy to add new information and new rules to the knowledge base. To illustrate the effectiveness of the system, short-term load forecasting is performed on the Taiwan power system by using both the developed algorithm and the conventional Box-Jenkins statistical method. It is found that a mean absolute error of 2.52% for one year is achieved by the expert system approach as compared to an error of 3.86% by the statistical method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.99372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3139/00099372.pdf","startPage":"1214","endPage":"1221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.99372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short term load forecasting of Taiwan power system using a knowledge-based expert system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99372/","displayDocTitle":"Short term load forecasting of Taiwan power system using a knowledge-based expert system","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3838982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short term load forecasting of Taiwan power system using a knowledge-based expert system","sourcePdf":"00099372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036903S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"3139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"150","articleId":"99372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":99376,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

The main driver is a real-time digital simulation of a large power system. A full-graphic human interface made up of several levels of one-line diagrams, tables and other displays permits the observation of the power system behavior in real time; it also makes it possible to affect its behavior by introducing supervisory control actions. These programs operate on a database, which can be changed to represent different power systems. The simulation and the database are run on a VAX 11-785 mainframe computer, while the human interface is run on an Apollo DN570 workstation with a 19-inch full-graphic color display. The two computers are linked via a high-speed Ethernet data link. The program-to-program communication was specifically developed for this application. The total environment created is that of a power system control center. It can be used to demonstrate and teach power system behavior as well as to experiment with all facets of the energy management system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.99392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3139/00099392.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.99392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real time power system simulation laboratory environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A real time power system simulation laboratory environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99392/","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1990","accessionNumber":"3838986","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real time power system simulation laboratory environment","sourcePdf":"00099392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025752S","chronDate":"Nov.  1990","isNumber":"3139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"24","articleId":"99392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":99410,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

The preamplifier circuit is implemented in two stages, each consisting of a common source circuit with a source follower. The output impedance matching is realized with a common source circuit. To obtain wide bandwidth and optimize the input impedance and noise characteristics, parallel feedback was applied. The gain-controllable amplifier adopts basically the same configuration as the preamplifier. The output of the main amplifier must be divided among decision, timing, and gain-controller circuits. Amplifiers with a three-way divider applying resistors and FETs have been studied. The amplifier ICs were fabricated by advanced SAINT (self-aligned implantation for N/sup +/-layer technology) process. These ICs have a 3-dB bandwidth of more than 5 GHz and can be applied to optical receivers transmitting NRZ (nonreturn to zero) signals in excess of 7 Gb/s.

The authors present experimental confirmation of the ability to detect the onset of slip, and discuss the sensor response to various surface texture parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing skin acceleration for slip and texture perception","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1989.99981","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, 1989 International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/242/3146/00099981.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"150 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00099981.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1989.99981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=99981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Sensing skin acceleration for slip and texture perception","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3451275","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing skin acceleration for slip and texture perception","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00099981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027372S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"133","articleId":"99981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":99999,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

This approach is based on a manifold mapping reformulation of manipulator kinematics. While the kinematic problem has an infinite number of solutions for redundant manipulators, the infinity of solutions can be grouped into a finite and bounded set of disjoint continuous manifolds. Each of these manifolds, termed self-motion manifolds, physically corresponds to a distinct self-motion of the manipulator, and the number, geometry, and characterizations of the self-motion manifolds are investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/99999/","accessionNumber":"3451292","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-19 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators: characterization of the self-motion manifolds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators: characterization of the self-motion manifolds","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00099999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022976S","chronDate":"14-19 May 1989","isNumber":"3146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"242","citationCount":"112","articleId":"99999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
