The millimeter-wave absorption coefficient values for the compensated silicon are at least one order of magnitude less than values obtained with undoped pure silicon. At 140 GHz, the loss tangent value of the compensated silicon is as low as 40 mu rad. The study of the dielectric properties of silicon as a function of resistivity reveals that the low-frequency free-carrier absorption present in all silicon (and other semiconductors) vanishes with increasing resistivity. The dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopic technique was utilized for the measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CPEM.1990.110005","publicationTitle":"Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements","pdfPath":"/iel5/118/3336/00110005.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPEM.1990.110005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter wave complex refractive index, complex dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of high purity and compensated silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110005/","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave complex refractive index, complex dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of high purity and compensated silicon","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3956465","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave complex refractive index, complex dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of high purity and compensated silicon","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00110005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109852S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1990","isNumber":"3336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"118","citationCount":"10","articleId":"110005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":110121,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The chip contains 77 K transistors on 78 mm/sup 2/. It is dedicated to running scalar integer applications. The chip consists of several independent functional units controlled on a cycle-by-cycle basis by a 200-b instruction. All units are pipelined and all stages operate in lock step, controlled by a single global clock. All units are connected to a shared on-chip multiport memory from which they take operands and into which they write results. Any previously computed result can be used as any operand of any unit. Ideally, six native operations can be initiated every cycle. In practice, the utilization of units will depend on the fine-grain parallelism that the application provides. Each unit (except the constant unit) gets an extra Boolean operand from the multiport guard memory. The guard controls whether the operation scheduled on the unit completes and whether the operation has any side effect on the processor state, such as completing a store or raising an arithmetic exception. All guards are independent and are used efficiently by the compiler to reduce the branch delay penalty drastically. A special design is required to get the necessary bandwidth from the multiport memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110121","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110121.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 500 MHz microprocessor with a very long instruction word architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 500 MHz microprocessor with a very long instruction word architecture","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3965939","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 500 MHz microprocessor with a very long instruction word architecture","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"110121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040205S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"16","articleId":"110121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":110123,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The redundancy circuit consists of an erasable PROM cell and an unerasable PROM cell for the storage of a nonfunctional address. Divided bit lines and tungsten polycide word lines are the keys to 85-ns access time. This device meets the requirements for high-density EPROMs to be used with 16-b or 32-b microprocessors. The EPROM uses 0.6- mu m n-well CMOS technology. The 2.0*1.8- mu m core cell has been scaled using (1) self-aligned trench isolation refilled with BPSG, (2) oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) interpoly dielectrics, and (3) a bit-line contact with a silicide pad and selective chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) tungsten. The resulting 16-Mb EPROM has a die area of 7.1*17.1 mm. Trench isolation technology minimizes the spacing between memory cells and ensures durability against the high gate voltage used in programming. Two ONO structures with a thickness equivalent to 20 nm of oxide serve as the interpoly dielectrics. To reduce the parasitic resistance of the core cell transistor, a 200-nm-thick tungsten silicide layer and a selectively deposited tungsten plug are used for the bit-line contact.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 85 ns 16 Mb CMOS EPROM with alterable word organization","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110127","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110127.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"An 85 ns 16 Mb CMOS EPROM with alterable word organization","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3965944","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 85 ns 16 Mb CMOS EPROM with alterable word organization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"110127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033941S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"4","articleId":"110127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":110130,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The circuits are designed with source-coupling techniques to achieve high-speed with small-signal swings, using only CMOS devices. A metal option permits selection of the 64 K*4 or 256 K*1 configuration. The same core architecture has also been used to generate *8 and *9 designs. One version achieves 3-ns output enable access time. SRAM speed-power ratio has traditionally been improved by array subdivision and address transition detection (ATD) to decrease current. However, for operation near 100 MHz, the advantage of ATD is diminished. The design described here removes ATD, allowing the row address to propagate statically. The resulting DC current is, countered with a strategy of (1) radically increasing array subdivisions and (2) exploiting small-signal techniques, preamplifiers, and current regulation. The core consists of 32 blocks with 128 rows and 64 columns per block.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"8 ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110163","startPage":"134","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110163.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"8 ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976019","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"8 ns CMOS 64 K*4 and 256 K*1 SRAMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046699S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"1","articleId":"110163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":110164,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The minimum feedforward propagation time is 10 mu s, equivalent to operation speed of 10/sup 8/ multiplications/s. Analog neuroprocessors with a storage capacitor for the synapse have been studied. The short retention time of the synapse weight has been an obstacle to the development of an analog neurochip. A dynamic refresh technique described here increases the retention time of the synapse weight, leading to a practical implementation of the neuroprocessor. The approach is to refresh the weight charge in the same manner as in DRAMs. All outputs from the synapses on the same column are summed and sent to a neuron cell. The weight from an off-chip digital memory is converted to analog form and then written on the storage capacitor of a synapse selected by x and y decoders. This scheme permits updating the weight by addressing the synapses sequentially. Iteration number in backpropagation learning depends on the operation accuracy of a sigmoid function generator and a multiplier. The network is hardly trained when the multiplier error is larger than 20%. To reduce the error, the neuroprocessor is based on a bipolar-MOS analog circuit, using bipolar transistors for both the multiplier and the sigmoid function generator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110167","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110167.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BiCMOS analog neural network with dynamically updated weights","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110167/","displayDocTitle":"A BiCMOS analog neural network with dynamically updated weights","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976022","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BiCMOS analog neural network with dynamically updated weights","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"110167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052068S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"33","articleId":"110167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":110168,"authors":[{"name":"H.P.

The voltage dependence and the mutual matching of large-area polysilicon resistors allow the design of a converter with high integral and differential linearity. However, in a single 1024-tap-resistor ladder, output settling requires such low tap resistors that accurate resistor matching, and consequently linearity, becomes a problem. The solution to this problem is the combination of a dual ladder with a matrix organization for the fine ladder, a full decoding scheme, an on-chip 75- Omega output buffer, and an additional ladder for the reduction of distortion at high signal frequencies. The coarse ladder consists of two ladders, each with 16 large-area 250- Omega resistors connected antiparallel to eliminate the first-order resistivity gradient. A 1024-resistor fine ladder is arranged in a 32*32 matrix, where every sixty-fourth tap is connected to the coarse ladder taps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 50 MHz 10-bit CMOS digital-to-analog converter with 75 Omega buffer","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110194","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110194.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 50 MHz 10-bit CMOS digital-to-analog converter with 75 Omega buffer","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976041","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 50 MHz 10-bit CMOS digital-to-analog converter with 75 Omega buffer","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027543S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"8","articleId":"110194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":110197,"authors":[{"name":"T.

By means of analogies to switched-capacitor circuits, a five-pole lowpass Chebyshev SI filter has been integrated in a 2- mu m N-well, double-metal CMOS technology. The average die area is about 200 mil/sup 2/ per SI pole. The current mirror gain factors were derived by means of signal flow-graph techniques starting with the RLC prototype. A doubly terminated five-pole Chebyshev filter was designed for a 0.1-dB ripple bandwidth of 5 kHz with a sampling frequency of 128 kHz. The measured response is shown. The noise floor is about 70 dB down with respect to the passband. A three-pole elliptic SI filter has also been integrated to illustrate the realization of transmission zeros with SI filter techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110197","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110197.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS switched-current filter technique","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976044","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110197/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS switched-current filter technique","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"110197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027016S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"20","articleId":"110197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":110198,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Feedforward-feedback paths for transmission zeros were implemented by connecting capacitors between the appropriate nodes on the basis of signal flow-graph analysis. For dynamic range optimization, only integral scaling of Gm was performed using multiple transconductance amplifiers. To facilitate signal addition, each Gm block is a two-input stage, single-output-stage transconductance amplifier. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the element matching achievable in fabrication meets specifications, provided the nominal cutoff frequency of the master is maintained by an on-chip tuning system. Simulations show that, to achieve this, it is necessary to tune both the magnitude and the phase of the filter. The master-slave approach of tuning used maintains accuracy in the presence of fabrication tolerances, temperature variations, and aging. The complete filter was implemented in a 1- mu m N-well CMOS process. The active area is 6 mm/sup 2/. The measured frequency response and the output noise spectrum are shown. To assess viability of this scheme in video antialiasing applications, 92 chips from various wafers were tested for yield, the variability of cutoff frequency, and ripple amplitude.

These specifications are for the high-definition-television (HDTV) format. The horizontal shift register consists of dual-channel, two-phase CCDs driven by a 37.125-MHz clock pulse. The readout phase of each channel is the same, which allows the reset gate of each channel to be connected together. To adapt to the 74.25-MHz readout frequency, one of the output signals is delayed by 13.47 ns through a sample-hold circuit. To reduce the voltage drop of the vertical shift register (V-CCD) drive pulse along the poly-Si transfer gate, an Al wire is put onto the transfer gate and interconnected to decrease the resistance. This Al wire works also as a photoshield.

This signal-processing capability is implemented with standard CMOS technology without decreasing the fill factor of the imager, without significantly increasing power dissipation, and with only a 15 % increase in chip area. As a column of image pixel data is shifted simultaneously, local interactions between neighboring column elements are directly performed in parallel. As row values are sequentially clocked through the processor local interactions between neighboring row elements are similarly performed by delay elements. This architecture is able to implement efficiently linear convolutions that are separable and recursively defined.

The port-configurable (PC) SRAM cell achieves the minimum area overhead associated with the configurability by using four port-customization terminals at every memory-cell boundary. Prior to customization, first and second polysilicon are used to connect the internal memory-cell nodes to the port-customization terminals. Multiport SRAMs are configured by first Al so that corresponding internal nodes of adjacent memory cells are connected. At the same time, word lines are configured according to the port customization using second Al and the via hole. The use of second Al is a key to the density and speed. A high-resistance polysilicon load cell is used to provide good write operation and high density. The cell size is 9*13.6 mu m, one-tenth the area of an equivalent multiport cell based on gate-array basic cells. The worst-case access speed of multiport configuration based on this scheme has no dependence on the number of ports because the memory-cell current available to drive unit bit-line load capacitance remains constant. In the multiport configuration, the write operation from one port must flip all of the connecting cells through the NMOS transfer gate of the write port cell. Therefore, a six-transistor full CMOS SRAM cell is not suitable for PC SRAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110207.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5 ns 369 kb port-configurable embedded SRAM with 0.5 mu m CMOS gate array","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 5 ns 369 kb port-configurable embedded SRAM with 0.5 mu m CMOS gate array","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3965953","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5 ns 369 kb port-configurable embedded SRAM with 0.5 mu m CMOS gate array","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025979S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"4","articleId":"110207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":110209,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Besides enhancing reliability, this technique allows power savings. The technique is based on regulation of the supply voltage of an equivalent critical path, a small circuit with delay V/sub dd/ properties proportional to those of the actual critical path. The output of this equivalent critical path is compared with the output of a second identical equivalent critical path which is connected to the full supply voltage and serves as a reference. In a first-order approximation the ratio of the delay of a critical path to the period of a ring oscillator is a constant that depends only on the number of gates, the dimensions of the transistors, and the load capacitances. This means that a ring oscillator can be used as an equivalent critical path for all digital circuits. Moreover, when the supply voltage of a ring oscillator (VCO) is changed the frequency changes. The voltage regulator principle can be implemented with a phase-locked loop (PLL). By adjusting the VCO supply voltage, the PLL causes the VCO to oscillate at N*f/sub in/. If the dimensions of the VCO transistors and the division ratio N are such that the critical path functions correctly at the regulated voltage, it will always function correctly, as changing parameters temperature or frequency f/sub in/ affect the VCO in the same way as the circuitry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110213","publicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 37th IEEE International Conference on Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/120/3337/00110213.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1990.110213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A voltage reduction technique for digital systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110213/","displayDocTitle":"A voltage reduction technique for digital systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3956194","conferenceDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A voltage reduction technique for digital systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026098S","chronDate":"14-16 Feb. 1990","isNumber":"3337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"120","citationCount":"94","articleId":"110213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":110228,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A normal force is applied to a displaced suspended structure by an underlying electrode. The tangential force to measure the frictional force is produced by a restoring force from the displaced suspension. The spring constant is found empirically by resonating the structure. The mu for coarse-grained polysilicon-polysilicon interfaces is found to be 4.9+or-1.0. Silicon nitride-polysilicon surfaces exhibit less friction with a mu of 2.5+or-0.5. Friction is found to be independent of apparent area. Tests were conducted on a piezoelectric crystal resulting in a reduction of friction and improved reliability of data extraction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.1990.110254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, An Investigation of Micro Structures, Sensors, Actuators, Machines and Robots.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Proceedings on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, An Investigation of Micro Structures, Sensors, Actuators, Machines and Robots.","pdfPath":"/iel2/126/3338/00110254.pdf","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polysilicon microstructures to characterize static friction","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1990.110254","startPage":"82","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Polysilicon microstructures to characterize static friction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110254/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3764179","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"11-14 Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polysilicon microstructures to characterize static friction","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029192S","chronDate":"11-14 Feb 1990","isNumber":"3338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"126","citationCount":"51","articleId":"110254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":110256,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A test device has been built (with silicon micromachining) for the study of electrowetting, and a detailed model of the devices is given. The model describes liquid flow in a small channel, as governed by Navier-Stokes equations, Laplace's equation, Young's equation, and Lippmann's equation. Simulation results presented indicate that electrowetting is a viable approach to microactuation: in a 10 mu m radius channel, it may be used to generate pressures on the order of 0.01 MPa, comparable to pressures generated by existing micropump designs are order of magnitude larger in size. Although the dynamics of the test device are dominated by fluid friction, it is also shown that another micropump design, based on mercury, should behave as a nearly frictionless oscillator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110258/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3776069","conferenceDate":"11-14 Feb. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary investigation of micropumping based on electrical control of interfacial tension","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary investigation of micropumping based on electrical control of interfacial tension","confLoc":"Napa Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00110258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052702S","chronDate":"11-14 Feb 1990","isNumber":"3338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"126","citationCount":"29","articleId":"110258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":110259,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

It is necessary to adjust the pre-distort waveform so that it can track changes in amplifier characteristics. An adaptive predistortion technique which uses a digital signal-processing microprocessor and memory look-up tables is described. The method differs from a previously described adaptive predistortion technique by using much smaller table sizes, with the result that conversion speeds are much higher. The disadvantage is that the processing overhead is higher, which puts a limit on the maximum data rate of the system. Low data rate services such as are found in mobile satellite applications (<17 kb/s) can be handled by this digital signal-processing approach. System requirements are examined, some alternative linearization techniques are described, and a more detailed analysis of adaptive predistortion is given.

According to the experimental and calculated results, the propagation loss is dominated by interference among the direct ray and specularly, building-reflected and mobile-reflected rays in the line-of-sight propagation environment, and by interference between specular rays and building-diffracted rays in shadowed propagation. Therefore, in line-of-sight propagation, the median of propagation loss is similar to the free-space loss. In shadowed propagation, however, the median is not determined only by the base-to-mobile antenna distance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of propagation characteristics above 1 GHz for microcellular land mobile radio","publicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1990.110354","displayPublicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/131/3339/00110354.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1990.110354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of propagation characteristics above 1 GHz for microcellular land mobile radio","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832625","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of propagation characteristics above 1 GHz for microcellular land mobile radio","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00110354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040328S","chronDate":"6-9 May 1990","isNumber":"3339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"131","citationCount":"14","articleId":"110354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":110356,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Since the peak output power coincides with the saturation power at a 4 dB backoff, the NLDC improves the backoff to the theoretical limit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/131/3339/00110381.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"546","publicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1990.110381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1990.110381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backoff improvement of an 800-MHz GaAs FET amplifier for a QPSK transmitter using an adaptive nonlinear distortion canceller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","FETs","Quadrature phase shift keying","Transmitters","Power amplifiers","Nonlinear distortion","Random access memory","Feedback loop","Power generation","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","electric distortion","field effect transistor circuits","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","phase shift keying","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["III-V semiconductors","UHF","QPSK signal","backoff improvement","cellular radio","radio transmitter","QPSK transmitter","adaptive nonlinear distortion canceller","Cartesian feedback loop","FET power amplifier","quadrature phase shift keying","rolloff factor","amplifier module","saturated power","out-of-band emission","center frequency","peak output power","800 MHz","50 percent","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Backoff improvement of an 800-MHz GaAs FET amplifier for a QPSK transmitter using an adaptive nonlinear distortion canceller","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853619","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backoff improvement of an 800-MHz GaAs FET amplifier for a QPSK transmitter using an adaptive nonlinear distortion canceller","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00110381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024456S","chronDate":"6-9 May 1990","isNumber":"3339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"131","citationCount":"18","articleId":"110381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":110384,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The channel coding used is assumed to be for error detection only; therefore, the throughput reduction due to coding is smaller than if the coding were used for error correction. Only practical ARQ protocols that can be implemented in real-time applications with finite-buffering capability are considered. Protocols implemented in software are used in a computer-simulated fading channel to study the throughput of these protocols for data communications. It is found that SR is significantly superior to GBN when fading rate is high; this advantage decreases as fading becomes slower.

An investigation is carried out to see how far a parallel neural network algorithm may be used for a real-world CAP. The neural network algorithm identified a channel assignment without heuristic rules generating the sequence of channel assignments. Formulating the optimization problems in terms of an energy function turned out to be very flexible, making it easy to include a variety of additional technical constraints and optimization criteria. Since a distinction between hard constraints and soft optimization criteria is only expressed by the relative strength of the terms in the energy function, the user is free to choose this relative strength according to his actual planning situation. Therefore, this neural network algorithm is well suited for the solution of real-world channel assignment problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110399/","accessionNumber":"3842717","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Practical channel assignment using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical channel assignment using neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00110399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048876S","chronDate":"6-9 May 1990","isNumber":"3339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"131","citationCount":"4","articleId":"110399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":110402,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The design of the RF and mixing circuits, as well as the baseband filtering and the vector-operation-based demodulation circuit are presented. Some computer simulations of the operating performance of this receiver system are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1990.110402","publicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/131/3339/00110402.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1990.110402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new incoherent direct conversion receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new incoherent direct conversion receiver","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3832644","publicationDate":"1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 1990","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new incoherent direct conversion receiver","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00110402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041278S","chronDate":"6-9 May 1990","isNumber":"3339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"131","citationCount":"23","articleId":"110402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":110405,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Instead of a fixed valued pilot symbol sequence, a scrambled pilot symbol sequence is transmitted to measure, and therefore to compensate for, the Rayleigh fading channel. The bit error rate (BER) performance of this system is investigated in fast Rayleigh fading, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and cochannel interference (CCI) environments by using computer simulation. The simulated results show that a 2.5 dB improvement is achieved over the differentially detected pi /4-DQPSK at a BER of 10/sup -3/. Unlike the differentially detected pi /4-DQPSK, the system does not have an error floor or residual bit error, provided that the frame length N is not longer than the upper limit of frame length, N/sub max/. Another significant advantage is that the proposed IJF-OQPSK modulated signal is shown to suffer less spectral spreading than pi /4-QPSK signaling over a nonlinearly amplified channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/131/3339/00110412.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"737","publicationTitle":"40th IEEE Conference on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1990.110412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1990.110412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=110412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital Rayleigh fade compensation technique for coherent IJF-OQPSK systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","AWGN","Computer errors","Intersymbol interference","Quadrature phase shift keying","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Additive white noise","Interchannel interference","Radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio systems","error compensation","fading","intersymbol interference","mobile radio systems","phase shift keying","random noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offset QPSK","digital mobile radio","digital Rayleigh fade compensation","coherent intersymbol interference-jitter-free","scrambled pilot symbol sequence","BER","fast Rayleigh fading","AWGN","cochannel interference","2.5 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/110412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"A digital Rayleigh fade compensation technique for coherent IJF-OQPSK systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital Rayleigh fade compensation technique for coherent IJF-OQPSK systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00110412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033539S","chronDate":"6-9 May 1990","isNumber":"3339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"131","citationCount":"7","articleId":"110412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":110440,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The neural network outputs are AUV rudder angle and propulsion power: basic vehicle maneuvering characteristics are incorporated in the model. Obstacle avoidance is accomplished using a proximity detector for avoiding static obstacles and a rate detector for avoiding moving obstacles.

This new approach, applicable to dual-gate FET (DGFET) variable-gain amplifiers, is to connect an active variable load to the second gate of the DGFET. This load makes use of a cold FET (with Vds=0 V) whose impedance varies depending on the amplitude command of the circuit. Then, the cold FET compensates the insertion phase change introduced by the DGFET attenuation control over a wide dynamic range. Based on this principle, a C-band GaAs MMIC attenuator for active antenna application has been designed.

In the RAM-DFE, a look-up table, which can be easily implemented with random access memory, (RAM), replaces the transversal filter feedback section of the DFE. The feedforward section of the equalizer remains linear. A general nonlinear Markov (or finite-state machine) model is used to model the nonlinear intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. With this Markov model, a method is introduced for computing the minimum-mean-squared-error settings of the feedforward filter coefficients and the feedback filter and look-up table contents for the linear DFE and the RAM-DFE, respectively. RAM-DFE with these settings can be significantly better than the linear DFE for channels with trailing nonlinear ISI. Globally convergent gradient-type algorithms for updating the feedforward section coefficients and the contents of the feedback table are introduced and analyzed.

It is not cost-effective to require testing time (and software development time) to diagnose failure modes which will probably never occur. In practice, the person repairing a circuit knows more about the circuit than anyone else, including the original developer of the diagnostic software. It is therefore desirable that meaningful diagnostic software be able to capture this expert knowledge as it becomes available to diagnose failure modes not anticipated in the original software development. To assist in this task, a user-friendly, menu-driven, artificially intelligent software program has been developed to assist the technician in diagnosing circuit card failures. As failures are diagnosed, the technician enters the corrective action as well as the essential failure and probing information. When similar failures are encountered in the future, the neural network diagnoses the most probable failure mode and directs the technician as to the information which would be useful in pinpointing the fault.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Sep 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/111509/","accessionNumber":"3936278","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-21 Sept. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interactive SRU diagnosis using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive SRU diagnosis using neural networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00111509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031159S","chronDate":"17-21 Sep 1990","isNumber":"3354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"109","citationCount":"6","articleId":"111509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":111534,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This relative placement algorithm addresses size effect and net connectivity effect simultaneously, while attaining a low polynomial time complexity O(kn/sup 2/) without loss of global perspective, where k is a constant and depends on the accuracy that the placement required.

However, since the optimal values of l/sub 0/ and DEF (deformation ratio) are unknown, different values for l/sub 0/ and DEF should be used in different circuits to obtain better placement results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.111925","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00111925.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.111925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1675 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new placement algorithm for custom chip design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=111925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new placement algorithm for custom chip design","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/111925/","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3865009","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new placement algorithm for custom chip design","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00111925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039708S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","articleId":"111925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":111947,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The Fourier transform (FT) is recomputed at each sample input time, with only O(N) operations being required to compute the transform, where N is the number of frequency bins. Various window functions are considered for windowing the input-wave form, namely a rectangular window, a triangular window, and an exponential window. The last type of window has not been widely considered in the past, partly due to its asymmetrical shape, and hence nonlinear phase response. Nevertheless, it is shown to have certain advantages in ease of computation and in flexibility. For the exponential window, a circuit that conveniently allows zooming in to particularly interesting parts of the frequency spectrum is shown. By appropriately loading a multiplier storage RAM, arbitrarily fine resolution may be achieved in any part of the spectrum, thus permitting closely adjacent peaks to be distinguished. The general approach is based on the interpretation of the FT as a set of simultaneous bandpass filters. Though these filters are generally finite-impulse-response filters, computational advantages are derived from formulating them as recursive filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.111983","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00111983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.111983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","startPage":"1792","endPage":"1795 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive computation of the Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=111983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recursive computation of the Fourier transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/111983/","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3876263","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive computation of the Fourier transform","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00111983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026199S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"14","articleId":"111983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":111984,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

A general expression for the reduction of in-band noise power as a function of coder order, quantizer resolution, and oversampling ratio is derived, together with a subsidiary condition imposed by the use of multibit DACs in the network. A coder topology is proposed which uses multibit quantization with single-bit feedback, overcoming the manufacturing of calibration difficulties inherent in the use of high resolution DACs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112045","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112045.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"375 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved sigma-delta modulator architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=112045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112045/","displayDocTitle":"An improved sigma-delta modulator architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832542","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved sigma-delta modulator architecture","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044104S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"100","articleId":"112045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":112054,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

The neural network is shown, via a theorem with proof, to select an open path through the interconnection network if one exists. The solution uses a Hopfield network with a binary threshold rather than a sigmoidal function. The weights of the neural network are fixed for all time, and thus are independent of the current state of the interconnection network. It is possible to implement various routing strategies through selection of inputs to the neural network, again independently of the weights. The convergence proof is based on a hypercube analysis technique that defines and locates all local minima of the neural network energy function. When one or more open paths exist, it is shown that all local minima correspond to such paths, and therefore convergence to a minimum is equivalent to selection of an open path. When no such path is available, the energy function is unimodal and the neural network converges to a null state indicating that the interconnection network is blocked.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112091","startPage":"483","endPage":"486 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112091.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network solutions for routing in three stage interconnection networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112091/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network solutions for routing in three stage interconnection networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3842631","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network solutions for routing in three stage interconnection networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027608S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"5","articleId":"112091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":112092,"authors":[{"name":"S.-K.

The optimal model f thus obtained consists of a two-layer feedforward net, the first layer being the same as the matching score layer of the Hamming net, and the second layer being a new layer (absent in the Hamming net) possessing synaptic weights which result from the described optimization procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112181","startPage":"723","endPage":"726 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112181.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new nonlinear functional analytic framework for modeling artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112181/","displayDocTitle":"A new nonlinear functional analytic framework for modeling artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3842664","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new nonlinear functional analytic framework for modeling artificial neural networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025024S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"17","articleId":"112181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":112182,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

The architecture has a structure similar to a content addressable memory (CAM). One work of CAM is regarded as a processing element, and a group of elements forms a neuron. All processing elements execute the same operation in bit-serial but in processor-parallel. Thus, the number of instructions for realizing the network algorithm is independent of the number of neurons in the network. With reference to a previously reported CAM, it is estimated that a network with 96 neurons for speech recognition could be integrated on three chips and that it would operate 50 times faster than sequential hardware.

The design of a simple third-order IIR SC interpolator building block with a sampling-rate increase of L=2 is illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112296","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2196 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112296.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infinite impulse response switched-capacitor interpolators with optimum implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Infinite impulse response switched-capacitor interpolators with optimum implementation","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3876355","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112296/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infinite impulse response switched-capacitor interpolators with optimum implementation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047118S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"11","articleId":"112296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":112301,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is based on the utilization of an SC macromodel for the operational amplifiers (op amps) when its own clock frequency tends to infinitum. This method extends the capability of a similarly based one previously developed by the authors. Its application allows the z-domain transfer functions, the complete frequency spectrum, and response sensitivities to element changes to be obtained in a quite inexpensive way. It basically consists of closed-form manipulations over a reduced set of matrices derived by means of an adaptation of the two-graph modified nodal approach. Therefore, no additional matrices need to be obtained. Also, the need for explicit numerical integration in each phase is eliminated because it is included in the procedure. This technique not only reduces the computational cost of spectral analysis of SC networks, but also makes exact sensitivity calculation very easy when compared with previously published works.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switched capacitor networks","Operational amplifiers","Computer networks","Spectral analysis","Switches","Frequency domain analysis","Transfer functions","Circuits","Telecommunication computing","Telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","frequency-domain analysis","matrix algebra","operational amplifiers","sensitivity analysis","spectral analysis","switched capacitor networks","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonideal switched capacitor networks","op amp asymptotic modelling","computer-oriented method","exact frequency-domain analysis","SC macromodel","operational amplifiers","z-domain transfer functions","frequency spectrum","response sensitivities","two-graph modified nodal approach","spectral analysis","SC networks","sensitivity calculation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112301","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112301.pdf","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2204 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact analysis and sensitivity of nonideal switched capacitor networks through op amp asymptotic modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=112301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exact analysis and sensitivity of nonideal switched capacitor networks through op amp asymptotic modelling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112301/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3876357","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact analysis and sensitivity of nonideal switched capacitor networks through op amp asymptotic modelling","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043742S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","articleId":"112301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":112302,"authors":[{"name":"X.C.

In the new algorithm, the search direction created at each optimization iteration is based on this second-order approximation. As a result, the computational efficiency has been greatly improved compared with other constrained optimization methods in terms of the number of function evaluations required (a measure which is crucial in the context of IC design).

Optimal methods for estimation of the missing lines from temporal and spacial frequency constraints are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112369","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112369.pdf","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1305 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal error estimation and interpolation in frequency constrained image sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=112369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112369/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal error estimation and interpolation in frequency constrained image sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3863555","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal error estimation and interpolation in frequency constrained image sequences","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044547S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"6","articleId":"112369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":112371,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Fast algorithms for computing the real discrete Fourier transform (FRFT) use Given's planar rotation as the basic computing kernel instead of the complex butterfly used in the FFT computation. Two approaches for the VLSI implementation of FRFT are presented. The first approach is based on an elegant implementation using a CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) processor. The second approach is based on the implementation using a distributed arithmetic scheme, which reorders the rotation as a sum of products and has the advantage of efficient mechanization. The global communication inherent in the FRFT algorithm is circumvented using the systolic elevator concept, which assures local communication in the algorithm. The proposed architectures exploit regularity and are quite simple and modular, hence very attractive for VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112473","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112473.pdf","startPage":"2316","endPage":"2319 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural design styles in the VLSI implementation of real discrete Fourier transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Architectural design styles in the VLSI implementation of real discrete Fourier transform","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3865029","publicationDate":"1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural design styles in the VLSI implementation of real discrete Fourier transform","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035104S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"2","articleId":"112473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":112478,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

It is shown that a very efficient in-place, in-order prime factor mapping (PFM) addressing scheme can best be applied to the model. In this scheme, a single mapping equation is used for both data loading and data retrieval, hence no extra unscrambling process is required. The authors propose the use of a form of two parallel recursive digital filters for the computation of each short-length DFT (discrete Fourier transform). A significant improvement in speed is thereby achieved. This algorithm has been realized using Fortran 77 language with the IBM PC AT. Results of the realization show that the proposed software computation model can achieve a 44% speed improvement over the radix-2 FFT (fast Fourier transform) algorithm, whereas the code length is comparable. As compared with the prime factor algorithm, it has a similar, if not better, speed performance for medium-length DFT computations. However, the code length is much shorter. This approach has the advantage of a large choice of sequence lengths, unlike the FFT algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112486.pdf","startPage":"2369","endPage":"2372 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=112486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced model for software realisation of recursive prime radix discrete Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Filters","Software algorithms","Equations","Concurrent computing","Computational modeling","Hardware","High performance computing","Parallel processing","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised signal processing","digital filters","Fourier transforms","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced model","software realisation","discrete Fourier transform","recursive prime radix algorithms","prime factor mapping","addressing scheme","data loading","data retrieval","parallel recursive digital filters","short-length DFT","Fortran 77 language","IBM PC AT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced model for software realisation of recursive prime radix discrete Fourier transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3865031","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced model for software realisation of recursive prime radix discrete Fourier transform","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077975S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"2","articleId":"112486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":112487,"authors":[{"name":"Yuk-Hee Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yuk-Hee Chan","id":"37289428700"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Wan-Chi Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"articleNumber":"112487","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":25},"abstract":"A formulation for converting a length-N, where N=2/sup m/ and m is an integer, discrete cosine transform into two length-N/2 correlations is presented.

Pulse-stream methodologies are chosen because they allow a noise-insensitive, hence efficient, transmission of information. Although this has not been the selection criterion, it is worth noting that the use of pulse streams has a counterpart in natural neural networks, which use these techniques heavily to transmit analog information in a noisy environment and to reduce the total power dissipation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112505","startPage":"2446","endPage":"2449 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112505.pdf","publicationTitle":"1990 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixing analog and digital techniques for silicon neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Working environment noise","Digital circuits","Performance analysis","Adaptive systems","Pulse circuits","Circuit noise","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","neural nets","pulse circuits","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dedicated implementations","artificial neural networks","digital circuits","performance improvement","pulse-stream circuits","size","selection criterion","analog information","noisy environment","power dissipation","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Mixing analog and digital techniques for silicon neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","accessionNumber":"3876412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixing analog and digital techniques for silicon neural networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047808S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"8","articleId":"112505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":112522,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-W.

The displacement vector is calculated by relating the maximization of a proposed similarity measure in the image-registration algorithm to the minimization of the network energy function in the neural implementation. The similarity criterion incorporated in the image-registration algorithm uses a coincident bit counting (CBC) method to obtain the number of matching bits between the frames of interest.

The stopband attenuation of these decimators is more than 120 dB. The decimators contain no general multipliers and a few data memory locations, thereby making them easily VLSI-realizable. This is achieved by using several decimation stages, with each stage containing a small number of delays and arithmetic operations. Some of the stages are constructed using low-order building blocks which are combined to give a selective filter using a few additional tap coefficients and adders. The output sampling rate of these decimators is the minimum possible one, and the proposed decimators can be used, with very slight changes, for many oversampling ratios. These decimators highly attenuate the undesired out-of-band signal components of the input signal, thus significantly relaxing the antialiasing prefilter requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112711","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/143/3356/00112711.pdf","startPage":"3275","endPage":"3278 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1990.112711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiplier-free decimator algorithms for superresolution oversampled converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multiplier-free decimator algorithms for superresolution oversampled converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3888000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112711/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiplier-free decimator algorithms for superresolution oversampled converters","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00112711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039976S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1990","isNumber":"3356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"143","citationCount":"19","articleId":"112711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":112712,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It assumes that the aspect angles (elevation and azimuth) of the target to be identified are unknown. The relative amplitude features are the ratios of the target amplitude returns of two different frequencies, and they are two-dimensional functions of the target aspect angles. The features are also related to target geometry, wave polarization, and frequency, but are independent of target range and other radar system parameters. The database contains a finite number of samples of reference target features taken at certain target aspect angles. The differences between the aspect angles of the unknown target and those of the samples, called the aspect offsets, cause identification error. An unknown target is considered identified if its nearest neighbor in the feature space is in the set of feature samples from the same reference target in the database. A computer simulation was conducted to determine the misidentification percentage, due to the aspect offsets, as a function of the aspect angle sampling intervals and the number of frequencies, based on amplitude returns from multiple point scatters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853742","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radar target identification with relative amplitudes and unknown target aspect angles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar target identification with relative amplitudes and unknown target aspect angles","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00112784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029223S","chronDate":"21-25 May 1990","isNumber":"3357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"150","citationCount":"5","articleId":"112784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":112818,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Attention is focused on a portion of the problem, i.e. global FDIE for single impairments of control effectors. Polynomial neural networks are synthesized using a constrained error criterion to obtain pairwise discrimination between impaired and no-fail conditions and isolation between impairment classes. The pairwise discriminators are then combined in a form of voting logic. Polynomial networks are also synthesized to obtain estimates of the amount of effector impairment. The algorithm for synthesis of polynomial networks (ASPN) and related methods are used to create the networks, which are high-order, linear or nonlinear, analytic, multivariate functions of the in-flight observables. The authors outline the design procedure, including database preparation, extraction of waveform features, network synthesis techniques, and the architecture of the FDIE system that has been studied for control reconfigurable combat aircraft (CRCA).

Advantages of neural networks over conventional digital avionic systems include speed (especially when implemented in special hardware, taking advantage of massive parallel processing), robustness, fault tolerance, and the ability to adapt to new situations by learning. An example shows how an artificial NN can be used as a gain adjuster in a stability augmentation system. A three-layer NN receives elevator commands and the sensed resulting longitudinal aircraft motion as input. The NN recognizes certain patterns in this response which are an indication that the gain is too high and that the control system is dangerously close to the stability boundary. Another example shows how a NN can solve a complex combinatorial problem which arises in search planning. It has similarities to the traveling salesman problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/112827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 May 1990","conferenceDate":"21-25 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3863937","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks in flight control and flight management systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks in flight control and flight management systems","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00112827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037933S","chronDate":"21-25 May 1990","isNumber":"3357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"150","citationCount":"4","articleId":"112827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":112896,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Such a processor-time-minimal scheduling of an algorithm's DAG first is illustrated using a triangular shaped 2-D directed mesh (representing, for example, an algorithm for solving a triangular system of linear equations). Then, algorithms represented by an n*n*n directed mesh are investigated. This cubical directed mesh is fundamental; it represents the standard algorithm for computing matrix product as well as many other algorithms. Completion of the cubical mesh required 3n-2 steps. It is shown that the number of processing elements needed to achieve this time bound is at least (3n/sup 2/4/). A systolic array for the cubical directed mesh is then presented. It completes the mesh using the minimum number of steps and exactly (3n/sup 2/4/) processing elements it is processor-time-minimal. The systolic array's topology is that of a hexagonally shaped, cylindrically connected, 2-D directed mesh.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.113078","startPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/3359/00113078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.113078","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A processor-time-minimal systolic array for cubical mesh algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"A processor-time-minimal systolic array for cubical mesh algorithms","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4115870","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A processor-time-minimal systolic array for cubical mesh algorithms","sourcePdf":"00113078.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077068S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","articleId":"113078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":113080,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

The possible incoherence of a cache entry is detected and the associated entry is implicitly invalidated by comparing a clock (related to program flow) and a timestamp (related to the time of update in the cache). Results of a performance comparison, which is based on a trace-driven simulation using actual traces. between the proposed timestamp-based scheme and other software-assisted schemes indicate that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than previous software-assisted schemes, especially when the processors are carefully scheduled so as to maximize the reuse of cache contents.

The modular and regular parallel architecture is based on a constant geometry algorithm using butterflies of four data items and the perfect unshuffle permutation.

An initial query is posed, and once it is discovered that the answer does not meet the additional constraints, which are not expressed in the relational query, it is necessary to modify the query in a way such that those constraints are satisfied. The aim of this work is to capture this iterative process by extending the query model. Extended queries, which express additional constraints on the answer set and designate some of the conditions in the relational query as flexible, are defined. The query modification operators modify flexible constraints to satisfy an extended query. The query modification operation, generalization, is described. The conditions under which generalization is applicable are identified.

However, all of these require that the ranges in the different dimensions be specified independently. In other words, only rectangular regions can be specified and searched for. Similarly, nonpoint objects can be indexed only in terms of their bounding rectangles. However, polyhedral search regions and polyhedral bounding rectangles can often provide a much greater selectivity in the search. It is shown how to use multiattribute search structures for polyhedral regions by mapping polyhedral regions into rectangular regions of a higher dimension. In particular, the P-tree (polyhedral tree) is introduced and shown to be an effective multiattribute index structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Feb 1990","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"5-9 Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3776028","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spatial search with polyhedra","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial search with polyhedra","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00113483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036434S","chronDate":"5-9 Feb 1990","isNumber":"3363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"274","citationCount":"38","articleId":"113483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":113496,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The principle of operation of the multiplier is based on two identical 12*12 null-bounded CA each having semi-group order 126. In practice, implementation utilizes the data compression capabilities of CA to reduce the area required by these arrays by about 90%. This is achieved by using triangular CA, each comprising 15 cells having appropriately chosen inertial boundary conditions. Encoding and decoding is performed on-chip and the complexity of this task is significantly reduced by observing only critical cells when ascertaining the state of a cellular automation. The main objective of this work was to determine performance and area requirements for this simpler tasks so predictions can then be made for more substantial units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1990.113682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1990.113682","publicationTitle":"COMPEURO'90: Proceedings of the 1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Software Engineering - Systems Engineering Aspects of Complex Computerized Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"COMPEURO'90: Proceedings of the 1990 IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Software Engineering - Systems Engineering Aspects of Complex Computerized Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/285/3365/00113682.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of modulo-arithmetic units using 2-D cellular automata","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 May 1990","accessionNumber":"3853632","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of modulo-arithmetic units using 2-D cellular automata","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00113682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028629S","chronDate":"8-10 May 1990","isNumber":"3365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"285","articleId":"113682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":113788,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An experiment designed to demonstrate the feasibility of overlaying a direct sequence code division multiple access (CDMA) personal communications network (PCN) on an existing set of narrowband microwave users is described. The frequency band 1850-1990 MHz was chosen for the experiment; this band will be divided into two 50 MHz subbands, one for the base-to-mobile link and the other for the mobile-to-base link (the remaining 40 MHz will be used for guard bands). The experiment has two phases associated with it. The initial phase corresponds to the test of a single cell. The goal of the initial phase is primarily to determine what limitations, if any, have to be placed upon the overlay system; once this has been established, a full scale field test is planned for spring 1991 in both Houston and Orlando where 20000 to 25000 users per city will be deployed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental CDMA personal communications network","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1991.113843","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/329/3368/00113843.pdf","startPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1991.113843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3368","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=113843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 March 1991","displayDocTitle":"An experimental CDMA personal communications network","conferenceDate":"27-30 March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4000158","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental CDMA personal communications network","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00113843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032877S","chronDate":"27-30 March 1991","isNumber":"3368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"329","articleId":"113843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":113846,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

It is shown that, by using a nonuniform sample sequence, with an appropriate anti-aliasing filter, one can whiten the spectrum of the filtering error as well as allow more high frequency information to be captured. The filtering error using this method, although randomized, may also be greater in magnitude than for the standard sampling and reconstruction process. Whether the noise level is increased unacceptably depends on the closeness of the matching of the signals to the sampling scheme. The idea is that, for some audio applications, the added random noise will be less objectionable than the muffling of the sound produced by standard sampling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1991.113852","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/329/3368/00113852.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"482","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1991.113852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whitening of filtering error using nonuniform sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Whitening of filtering error using nonuniform sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 March 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4000167","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whitening of filtering error using nonuniform sampling","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00113852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032589S","chronDate":"27-30 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"329","articleId":"113852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":113853,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is found that unless an appropriate number of interpolation points are chosen on an appropriate number of irreducible curves, the resulting problem might become singular. Specifically, if the sum of the degrees of the irreducible curves on which the interpolation points are chosen is small compared to the degree of the interpolating polynomial, then the problem becomes singular. Similarly, if there are too many points on any of the irreducible curves on which the interpolation points are chosen, the interpolation problem runs into singularity. Examples of geometric distributions of interpolation points satisfying these conditions are shown. The examples include polynomial interpolation of polar samples, and samples on straight lines.

The results suggest that orthogonal signaling schemes are preferable to the on-off orthogonal signaling schemes. It is also shown that prime codes are much better than the optical orthogonal codes for optical code-division multiplexing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1991.113857","publicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991 Proceedings] Tenth Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/329/3368/00113857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1991.113857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3368","startPage":"513","endPage":"519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-detection APD-based optical CDMA using orthogonal signalings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=113857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct-detection APD-based optical CDMA using orthogonal signalings","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/113857/","conferenceDate":"27-30 March 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4000172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-detection APD-based optical CDMA using orthogonal signalings","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00113857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049927S","chronDate":"27-30 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"329","citationCount":"2","articleId":"113857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":113884,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The concept of destination removal is dependent upon the destination address space and a uniform distribution was used in the analysis and simulation for this work.

The method is based on very simple objects, namely, double-cube divisors and single-cube divisors with only two laterals. It is demonstrated that these objects, despite their simplicity, provide a very good framework for reasoning about common algebraic divisors and duality relations between expressions. Since both the time and space complexity of the operations on double-cube and single-cube divisors is polynomial in the size of the two-level representation, the algorithms run much faster than those based on kernels. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that the decomposition and factorization transformations introduced preserve testability, which implies that a complete test set developed for an input network also gives complete coverage of faults in the synthesized multi-level network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1990.114032","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Scan flip-flops result in layout and delay overheads. Hence, scan flip-flops have to be chosen such that the net cost associated with these overheads is bounded by some user-specified limit. The problem then reduces to choosing a set of flip-flops which gives the best improvement in testability, while keeping the cost bounded. Cost functions are proposed for a standard cell design approach to model the effects of the overheads. Profit functions for three different testability criteria are proposed, and the optimization methodology for each is discussed. The optimization process is modeled on the lines of the 0/1 knapsack problem. Results for some medium-sized sequential circuits which show a very large improvement in fault coverage obtained by optimally selecting a small fraction of the flip-flops in the circuit are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Unlike conventional parallel pattern or parallel fault simulators, CMP3F can dynamically choose the fault set size as well as the number of vectors being simulated in parallel. Hence, the fault simulation process is split into several phases. The first phase primarily uses fault-list partitioning because, initially, the fault-list size dominates the fault simulation time. If fault dropping is allowed, CMP3F goes through a number of subsequent phases as the fault list becomes smaller, simulating an increasing number of distinct sets of vectors in parallel. Thus, CMP3F avoids useless computations when a small number of faults are present and maintains nearly linear speedup with an increasing number of processors. Experimental data obtained using ISCAS85 benchmark circuits suggest that CMP3F implemented on a fully configured 64 K-node CM, will perform fault simulation one to two orders of magnitude faster than most existing fault simulators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1990.114049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

As a practical test procedure, a data retention test, in which BIST circuits with an 8-word*11-b ROM were used, was investigated. BIST circuit area overheads for the above three test patterns for 16-Mb DRAMs are less than 1%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. A testing method for the BIST circuits themselves, with no special BIST circuit overhead, is also proposed for more practical applications. The measured operational margin for a 16-Mb DRAM using the BIST showed a good agreement with that using an LSI tester.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Accurate simulation of such faults mandated the development of several new design automation tools, including an analog-digital fault simulator. The results of this simulation are analyzed. It is shown that stuck fault test generation, while inherently incapable of directly expressing many of the likely CMOS faults, was still able to generate a set of effective test patterns. Current monitoring, however, by virtue of its more accurate model and less stringent detection criterion, was able to generate tests of measurably higher quality. It is concluded that the selection of one technique over the other becomes a cost tradeoff. Current testing produced test patterns that were consistently more effective in detecting bridging faults. This higher quality comes at higher start-up costs aid higher costs per chip design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS bridging fault detection","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Teradyne's LASAR was used to simulate bridging and stuck-at faults in a number of combinational circuits, including parity trees, multiplexers, and the 74ASCI181 4-b, 16-function ALU (arithmetic and logic unit). When the traditional technique was used, between 30%-50% of the bridging faults were mis-diagnosed, with the presence of a failure indicated on a fault-free node. In addition, as the stuck-at-fault diagnostic ability of a test increased, the bridging fault diagnostic ability decreased. By use of the new technique. over 92% of the bridging faults in the circuits used for this research were diagnosed correctly and less than 4% led to misleading diagnoses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Simulations were done to determine the electrical behavior and detection possibilities of the defects. The authors introduce a test pattern for functional testing of SRAMs. It was found, by testing more than 7000 devices, that this 6N march pattern produces the same results as a 13N pattern in over 99.9% of the tested devices. Because of this, the 6N algorithm can be used in special applications, such as embedded SRAMS and RAMs with built-in self test, where it can decrease the area overhead for the different blocks. A theoretical analysis predicted the presence of RAM states in which I/sub DDQ/ would be elevated. The practical results have clearly shown the existence of I/sub DDQ/ states in a six-transistor cell. In the 8K*8 SRAM used, all I/sub DDQ/ faults in the memory matrix will also result in a functional error, owing to destructive readout. It was found that there are I/sub DDQ/ faults in the periphery of the 8K*8 SRAM which do not show a functional error. By use of the I/sub DDQ/ test, a problem in the X-decoders was found. clearly demonstrating the relevance of the I/sub DDQ/ testing to product engineering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional and I/sub DDQ/ testing on a static RAM","doi":"10.1109/TEST.1990.114113","startPage":"929","endPage":"937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.1990.114113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3370","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Influential factors have been the lack of suitable wavelength defined sources and the increased losses of the multiplexing elements which limit the system range. Solutions to these problems are in the form of higher power, wavelength definable DFB lasers, higher sensitivity receivers and optical amplifiers (either semiconductor lasers or fibre types). The authors show that wavelength multiplexed systems can be interconnected to form an optical transmission network infrastructure that offers similar planning flexibility to those currently used but with increased bandwidth. With the progress of optical switching technology it is possible to foresee how flexibility can be added to these networks to provide automatic routing and protection of high capacity channels.

An optical subsystem generates a set of delayed signals which are transferred to the elements by fiber optics. The time delays are generated by creating frequency-dependent microwave phase shifts in the optical system. An optical fiber array spatially samples optical wavefronts and transfers the optical signals to the array where they are heterodyne detected to recreate the microwave signals at the input to transmit-receive (TR) modules. This process essentially extends the backplane of the antenna back to the control system where element level operations may be performed. All beamforming and nullforming functions may be implemented, e.g. monopulse. The requisite TR modules have no phase shifters and a minimum of logic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1991.114723","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/515/3380/00114723.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1991.114723","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE National Radar Conference","startPage":"50","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave time delay beamforming using optics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Microwave time delay beamforming using optics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114723/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"3977053","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-13 March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave time delay beamforming using optics","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00114723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026177S","chronDate":"12-13 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"515","citationCount":"3","articleId":"114723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":114747,"authors":[{"name":"S.O.

Fine range resolution, which depends on good frequency sweep linearity, improves the target-to-clutter power ratio by reducing the clutter area. This analysis shows that an extremely wide bandwidth linearizer is required for high range resolution with the sawtooth FMCW waveform. Time gating at the ends of the frequency sweep significantly reduces the nonlinearity. Triangle FMCW requires less linearizer bandwidth than the sawtooth modulation for a given linearity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1991.114747","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE National Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1991 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/515/3380/00114747.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1991.114747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FMCW linearizer bandwidth requirements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114747/","displayDocTitle":"FMCW linearizer bandwidth requirements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"3977067","conferenceDate":"12-13 March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FMCW linearizer bandwidth requirements","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00114747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086138S","chronDate":"12-13 Mar 1991","isNumber":"3380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"515","citationCount":"18","articleId":"114747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":114774,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A micro-magnetic alloy tube, with an inner diameter a few microns larger than that of a standard single-mode fiber and a thickness of several tens of microns, has been successfully fabricated by a combination of the metallization and etching of a glass fiber. The tube can easily be inserted into the fiber and fixed by adhesive to construct an optical switch or to splice fibers. The developed mechanically actuated single-mode fiber switch has a latching-type switching mechanism and exhibits a low insertion loss of 0.9 dB and a low driving power of 9 mW with a relatively short switching response time of <6 ms. It exhibits high stable operation throughout endurance, vibration, and shock tests. The microtube has also been applied to single-mode fiber splicing. In the tube, facing fibers can be aligned with a lateral misalignment of less than 2 mu m. Transparent adhesive is used to bond the fibers to the tube. The adhesive also serves as an index matching fluid to reduce the Fresnel reflection loss at the fiber ends. The measured splicing losses are 0.3-0.5 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Splicing","Optical fiber testing","Optical switches","Micromagnetics","Metallization","Etching","Glass","Optical fiber losses","Insertion loss","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["etching","optical couplers","optical fibres","optical switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-mode fibers","switching","micromagnetic alloy tubes","metallization","etching","optical switch","mechanically actuated single-mode fiber switch","latching-type switching mechanism","insertion loss","driving power","switching response time","vibration","shock tests","lateral misalignment","index matching fluid","Fresnel reflection loss","splicing losses","0.9 dB","9 mW","0.3 to 0.5 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1991.114774","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings.

Sheath flow geometry is formed in a two-dimensional passage configuration. A viscous flow analysis using the finite element method helps to examine the inside flow of a small passage and design the passage configuration. The micro-sheath flow chamber consists of bent passages for sheath fluid, a constricted passage, and a capillary tube. The height of these passages is 300 mu m. The viscous flow analysis reveals that swirl flow is generated at the constricted passage, causing the sample flow to scatter. This result suggests that a sample flow guide plate is needed to eliminate the swirl flow and induce a flow to envelope the sample fluid. Experimental measurement of the sample flow using a guide plate shows that smooth constricted sheath flow is obtained and that the velocity reaches 3.0 m/s, nearly the same speed as the value obtained by the viscous analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1991.114808","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings.

Visual observation of the spheres indicates that they move in the direction of wave propagation with a speed proportional to the square of the acoustic amplitude. The maximum speed is 130 mu m/s for an RF drive voltage of 7.1 Vrms at 3.5 MHz; the wavelength is 100 mu m. Standing Lamb waves, which can be seen visually with a phase-contrast microscope, are found to trap particles, including bacteria located in a drop of water that contacts the membrane. A first order model of Lamb-wave micropumping is presented, based on acoustic streaming theory. Important parameters for device design and operation are discussed, along with options for integrating the device into microflow systems. Possible applications include temperature redistribution in ICs and miniature chemical processing systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings.

It uses a minimum net-cut criteria to partition standard cells into flexible virtual blocks before block placement. Blocks are then placed using a simulated annealing optimization. The block placement algorithm evaluates placements based on both routing area costs and net costs. An adaptive move selection algorithm maximizes the annealing performance. A simple annealing-based optimization of the standard cell partitions completes the process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Simulated annealing","Partitioning algorithms","Area measurement","Length measurement","Temperature","Circuit simulation","Routing","Optimization methods","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","simulated annealing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard cell designs","automatic placement","integrated circuit layouts","macro block placement program","minimum net-cut criteria","flexible virtual blocks","simulated annealing optimization","routing area costs","net costs","adaptive move selection algorithm","standard cell partitions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114824","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114824","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114824","startPage":"32","endPage":"35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated placement for mixed macro cell and standard cell designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated placement for mixed macro cell and standard cell designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976075","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated placement for mixed macro cell and standard cell designs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045086S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"17","articleId":"114824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":114826,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

A package for manipulating Boolean functions based on the reduced, ordered, binary decision diagram (ROBDD) representation is described. The package is based on an efficient implementation of the if-then-else (ITE) operator. A hash table is used to maintain a strong canonical form in the ROBDD and memory use is improved by merging the hash table and the ROBDD into a hybrid data structure. A memory function for the recursive ITE algorithm is implemented using a hash-based cache to decrease memory use. Memory function efficiency is improved by using rules that detect when equivalent functions are computed. The usefulness of the package is enhanced by an automatic and low-cost scheme for recycling memory. Experimental results are given to demonstrate why various implementation trade-offs were made. These results indicate that the package described is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than other ROBDD implementations described in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","startPage":"40","endPage":"45","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114826","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114826.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of a BDD package","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","displayDocTitle":"Efficient implementation of a BDD package","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976077","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient implementation of a BDD package","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029256S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"415","articleId":"114826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":114827,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Clarke et al. (ACM Trans. Prog. Lang. Syst., vol.8, no.2, p.244-63, 1986) is modified to represent a state graph using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Because this representation captures some of the regularity in the state space of sequential circuits with data path logic, one is able to verify circuits with an extremely large number of states. This new technique is demonstrated on a synchronous pipelined design with approximately 5*10/sup 20/ states. The logic that is used to specify circuits is a propositional temporal logic of branching time, called CTL or Computation Tree Logic. The model checking algorithm handles full CTL with fairness constraints. Consequently. it is possible to handle a number of important liveness and fairness properties. which would otherwise not be expressible in CTL. The method presented is not necessarily a replacement for brute-force state-enumeration methods but an alternative that may work efficiently when the brute force methods fail.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential circuit verification using symbolic model checking","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114827","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114827.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Sequential circuit verification using symbolic model checking","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976078","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential circuit verification using symbolic model checking","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03592S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"114","articleId":"114827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":114828,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The application results are described for the case of clock skew control of an ECL 12K-gate array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114836","startPage":"96","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114836.pdf","endPage":"102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114836/","displayDocTitle":"A new min-cut placement algorithm for timing assurance layout design meeting net length constraint","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3976086","publicationDate":"1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new min-cut placement algorithm for timing assurance layout design meeting net length constraint","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070765S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"17","articleId":"114836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":114837,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Timing constraints are first converted to geometric shapes using the defined windows. A window represents a region in which all the modules along a given path can be placed without degrading the circuit performance. Then a constructive placement process uses the window information to select an unplaced module, and to find all appropriate position for the module.

First, hierarchy transformations are applied to reconcile the structures of the views: then a hierarchical base comparison finishes the task.

The choice of the buffers and the topology of the distribution tree depends on the availability of different strength gates and on the load and the required times at the destination. Since the area-constrained fanout problem is NP-complete and area is not a major consideration in present high-density designs, attention is restricted to the simpler problem of designing fast fanout circuits without any area constraint. The proposed algorithm builds the fanout tree by partitioning the fanout signals into subsets and then recursively solving each subproblem. At each stage the algorithm generates a fanout tree that is an improvement over the previous stage. This feature allows the user to specify the improvement desired by the fanout correction process. The performance of the algorithm, when run on randomly generated distributions of required times and on real design examples, is very promising.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114882.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"360","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic algorithm for the fanout problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Delay","Partitioning algorithms","Timing","Circuit testing","Topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Electronics industry","Circuit synthesis","Circuit optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","logic CAD","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","heuristic algorithm","fanout problem","buffers","topology","NP-complete","fanout tree","partitioning","randomly generated distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic algorithm for the fanout problem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976126","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic algorithm for the fanout problem","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030383S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"46","articleId":"114882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":114897,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Some new techniques are discussed for compaction of flow graphs beyond basic block limits, which can produce order-of-magnitude speedups versus serial execution. The presented algorithm applies to programs with conditional jumps, loops, and multicycle pipelined operations. In order to schedule under resource constraints, one starts by first finding the optimal schedule (without constraints) and then adds heuristics to map the optimal schedule onto the given system. It is argued that starting from an optimal schedule is one of the most important factors in scheduling because it offers the user flexibility to tune the heuristics and gives a good bound for the resource-constrained schedule. This scheduling algorithm is integrated with a synthesis tool which uses VHDL as input description and produces a structural netlist of generic register-transfer components and a unit-based control table as output.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114897","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","startPage":"444","endPage":"449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Percolation based synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Percolation based synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114897/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976139","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Percolation based synthesis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049417S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"70","articleId":"114897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":114903,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Two techniques contribute to the high efficiency. First, it employs the zero-delay simulation model with levelized event scheduling to eliminate most unnecessary evaluations. Second, it compiles the central event scheduler into simple local scheduling segments which reduces the overhead of event-scheduling. Experimental results show that LECSIM runs about 8-77 times faster than traditional unit-delay event-driven interpretive simulator. LECSIM also provides the option of scheduling with respect to individual gates or to fan-out free blocks. When the circuit is partitioned into fan-out free blocks, the speed increases by a factor of 2-3. With partitioning, the speed of LECSIM is only about 1.5-3.4 times slower than a levelized compiled simulation for the combinational circuits tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114905.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LECSIM: a levelized event-driven compiled logic simulator","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114905","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"LECSIM: a levelized event-driven compiled logic simulator","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976147","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LECSIM: a levelized event-driven compiled logic simulator","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024268S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"32","articleId":"114905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":114907,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Yi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chu-Yi Huang","id":"38226682500"},{"name":"Yen-Shen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Shen Chen","id":"38226767400"},{"name":"Yan-Long Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yan-Long Lin","id":"37279529200"},{"name":"Yu-Chin Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Chin Hsu","id":"37287607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-89791-363-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"114907","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Integrated circuit interconnections","Very large scale integration","Fabrication","Computer science","Registers","Costs","Process design","Algorithm design and analysis","Integrated circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","graph theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipartite weighted matching","graph-theoretic approach","data path allocation","register allocation","operation assignment","connection allocation","Hungarian method","greedy method","LYRA","ARYL","register allocation","interconnection cost"]}],"abstract":"Proposes a graph-theoretic approach for the data path allocation problem. The problem is decomposed into three subproblems: (1) register allocation, (2) operation assignment, and (3) connection allocation. The first two subproblems are modeled as two bipartite weighted matching problems and solved using the Hungarian method. The third subproblem is solved using a greedy method. It is shown that, by taking the other into consideration while solving one, equally satisfactory results can be obtained, regardless of the order in which (1) and (2) are performed. Two programs, LYRA and ARYL, are implemented which solve the subtasks in different orders. For register allocation, the approach is the first one to guarantee minimal use of registers while being able to take the interconnection cost into account.

In previously reported works, the routing of a clock net has been performed using ordinary global routing techniques based on a minimum spanning or minimal Steiner tree that have little understanding of clock-routing problems. The authors present a novel approach to the clock-routing that all but eliminates clock skew and yields excellent phase delay results for a wide range of chip sizes, net sizes (pin count), minimum feature sizes, and pin distributions on both randomly created and standard industrial benchmarks. For certain classes of pin distributions a decrease in skew with an increase in net size was proven theoretically and observed experimentally. A two to three order magnitude reduction in skew when compared to a minimum rectilinear spanning tree was observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock routing for high-performance ICs","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114920","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114920.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Clock routing for high-performance ICs","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976160","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock routing for high-performance ICs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039976S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"137","articleId":"114920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":114922,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

It is difficult to map into lookup tables using previous techniques because a single lookup table can perform a large number of logic functions and prior approaches require each function to be instantiated separately in a library. The new algorithm, implemented in a program called Chortle, uses the fact that a K-input lookup table can implement any Boolean function of K inputs and so does not require a library-based approach. Chortle takes advantage of this complete functionality to evaluate all possible decompositions of the input Boolean network nodes. It can determine the optimal (in area) mapping for fanout-free trees of combinational logic. In comparison with the MIS II technology mapper, on MCNC-89 LOGIC Synthesis benchmarks Chortle achieves superior results in significantly less time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chortle: a technology mapping program for lookup table-based field programmable gate arrays","publicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1990.114927","displayPublicationTitle":"27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/790/3382/00114927.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1990.114927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=114927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/114927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Chortle: a technology mapping program for lookup table-based field programmable gate arrays","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976166","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chortle: a technology mapping program for lookup table-based field programmable gate arrays","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00114927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055474S","chronDate":"24-28 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"790","citationCount":"74","articleId":"114927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":114928,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Each individual receiver module is divided into four mechanical packages. The element submodule is in stripline and contains the radiating element, C-band filtering, and calibration signal coupling functions. The RF submodule performs two downconversions and, like the element submodule, must fit into a one-half wavelength element spacing. The IF submodule contains a SAW filter for setting the signal bandwidth and a final downconversion to a low intermediate frequency (IF). The digital submodule contains the A/D converter for digitizing the downconverted RF information. The receivers considered represent the state-of-the-art in readily producible receiver modules; the components have been integrated and packaged to reduce module size for a relatively high-performance radar receiver. The quantity of receiver modules built dictated that tweaking to obtain desired performance be minimized. There was a tradeoff between tactical performance, prototype performance, and cost that resulted in the decision to implement the 400-kHz signal bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3976602","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Digital beamforming receiver technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital beamforming receiver technology","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00115126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059198S","chronDate":"7-11 May 1990","isNumber":"3384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"106","citationCount":"1","articleId":"115126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":115127,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The calculated results were in fairly good agreement with experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1990.115167","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation Society, Merging Technologies for the 90's","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation Society, Merging Technologies for the 90's","pdfPath":"/iel2/106/3384/00115167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1990.115167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3384","startPage":"543","endPage":"546 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a correlation coefficient of built-in diversity antennas for a portable telephone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a correlation coefficient of built-in diversity antennas for a portable telephone","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115167/","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3956702","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a correlation coefficient of built-in diversity antennas for a portable telephone","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00115167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031982S","chronDate":"7-11 May 1990","isNumber":"3384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"106","citationCount":"9","articleId":"115167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":115183,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.M.

A weak form of this integral equation is obtained by testing it with subdomain basis functions. As the next step, the vector potential is expanded in a sequence of subdomain basis functions and the grad-div operator is integrated analytically. It is shown that a well-behaved operator is obtained which can properly be solved numerically by a conjugate gradient FFT (fast Fourier transform) iterative method. For the problem of electromagnetic scattering by a plate, the present method shows excellent numerical performance. The numerical difficulties encountered in the previous CGFFT methods have been eliminated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115183/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3966254","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An improved conjugate gradient FFT method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved conjugate gradient FFT method","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00115183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031206S","chronDate":"7-11 May 1990","isNumber":"3384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"106","articleId":"115183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115188,"authors":[{"name":"K.-L.

The director element increases the gain of the antenna, while the matching element widens the frequency bandwidth of the input impedance. By adjusting the distance between the matching element and the radiating element by varying the height of the former element, the input impedance of the antenna is matched to the output impedance of the feed line. The proposed antenna, therefore, has wider impedance bandwidth and higher gain than the single-patch antenna. Since this antenna can be directly fed from the back of the ground plane, the feed circuit is simpler than that of the planar array antenna. For mobile communications, the stacked microstrip antenna array is useful when a gain of about 8 approximately 12 dBi is required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115311/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3956839","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stacked microstrip antenna with wide band and high gain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stacked microstrip antenna with wide band and high gain","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00115311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036488S","chronDate":"7-11 May 1990","isNumber":"3384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"106","citationCount":"6","articleId":"115311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":115330,"authors":[{"name":"L.J. du Toit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa"],"firstName":"L.J.","lastName":"du Toit","id":"37350902300"},{"name":"J.H.

All are normalized by the free-space impedance. The maximally flat solution of Fante and McCormack (1988) is extended to any number of layers, with proven solvability up to 20 layers. An equiripple solution, which, for a given number of layers and specified maximum reflection coefficient, exhibits a wider bandwidth than the corresponding maximally flat solution, is described.

The results obtained show that for beam waveguide designs using reflectors of diameters less than 27 lambda , there is insufficient control of the output phase center at the second aperture.

The radiation characteristics of the antenna are excellent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1990.115475","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation Society, Merging Technologies for the 90's","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation Society, Merging Technologies for the 90's","pdfPath":"/iel2/106/3384/00115475.pdf","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1781 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1990.115475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 May 1990","displayDocTitle":"Coplanar waveguide fed phased array antenna","conferenceDate":"7-11 May 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976638","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115475/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coplanar waveguide fed phased array antenna","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00115475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030506S","chronDate":"7-11 May 1990","isNumber":"3384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"106","citationCount":"6","articleId":"115475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":115502,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The potential search space increased from 46000 to 516000 states without problems for the data-driven search. Increasing the recognition vocabulary by a factor of 10 (from a perplexity of 917 to 9686) increased the word error rate by a factor of two (from 21.8% to 43.1%). Phoneme models were tested with both discrete probabilities and continuous mixture densities. The mixture density models performed better; moreover, they saved about half of the search costs. A language model was found to be very important for a larger vocabulary size. With a test set perplexity of 388 (i.e. a reduction by a factor of 25 compared to the case without a bigram model) the error rate decreased by a factor of 2.4. In order to check how meaningful perplexity is for the prediction of the system's performance, a stochastic language model was constructed with a perplexity of 1000, the size of the vocabulary used in previous experiments, and about the same error rate was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10000-word continuous-speech recognition system","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115536","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115536.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"60 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 10000-word continuous-speech recognition system","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853850","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10000-word continuous-speech recognition system","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079997S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"4","articleId":"115536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":115538,"authors":[{"name":"L.S.

The N-best algorithm is a time-synchronous Viterbi-style beam search procedure that is guaranteed to find the N most likely whole sentence alternatives that are within a given beam of the most likely sentence. The computation is linear with the length of the utterance, and faster than linear in N. When used together with a first-order statistical grammar, the correct sentence is usually within the first few sentence choices. The output of the algorithm, which is an ordered set of sentence hypotheses with acoustic and language model scores can easily be processed by natural language knowledge sources without the huge expansion of the search space that would be needed to include all possible knowledge sources in a top-down search. In experiments using a first-order statistical language model, the average rank of the correct answer was 1.8 and was within the first 24 choices 99% of the time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115542","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115542.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"84 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The N-best algorithms: an efficient and exact procedure for finding the N most likely sentence hypotheses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115542/","displayDocTitle":"The N-best algorithms: an efficient and exact procedure for finding the N most likely sentence hypotheses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853856","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The N-best algorithms: an efficient and exact procedure for finding the N most likely sentence hypotheses","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02425S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"87","articleId":"115542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":115545,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

A novel speech recognition system based on this theory in which the acoustic-to-phonetic mapping is accomplished by means of a particular form of hidden Markov model and is independent of lexical and syntactic constraint is described. Word recognition is then treated as a classical string-to-string editing problem which is solved with a two-level dynamic programming algorithm that accounts for lexical and syntactic structure. The system was tested on speaker-independent recognition of fluent speech from the 991-word DARPA resource management task, on which 76.6% word accuracy was achieved. In informal tests it was observed that the phonetic transcription can be resynthesized to provide a 100-bit/s vocoder with word intelligibility rates of approximately 75%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115545","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115545.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous speech recognition from a phonetic transcription","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115545/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous speech recognition from a phonetic transcription","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853859","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous speech recognition from a phonetic transcription","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065936S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"5","articleId":"115545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":115546,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

In contrast to other methods that use a pooled reference model, this technique normalizes the training speech from multiple reference speakers to a single common feature space before pooling it. The normalized and pooled speech is then treated as if it came from a single reference speaker for training the reference hidden Markov model (HMM). The usual probabilistic spectrum transformation can be applied to the reference HMM to model a new speaker.

A special kind of adaptation is investigated where the emphasis is not on the adaptation of the statistical parameters of the Markov models but on the adaptation of the structure of these models. This structure is defined by the baseforms describing the composition of word models from phone models in the system. Therefore, baseform adaptation corresponds directly to the adaptation of the new system to the personal speaker characteristics of the new user. Several different baseform adaptation schemes are investigated and it is demonstrated that for a speaker who has already trained the system and achieves a 95.2% recognition performance, the performance can be further improved to 96.3%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Baseform adaptation for large vocabulary hidden Markov model based speech recognition systems","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115558","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115558.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Baseform adaptation for large vocabulary hidden Markov model based speech recognition systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853871","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Baseform adaptation for large vocabulary hidden Markov model based speech recognition systems","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046368S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"2","articleId":"115558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":115559,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

It is shown that they reduce the optimal-search computation per codeword. They also allow control of the statistical properties of the codebook in the time and frequency domains.

Each person known to the system has a personalized neural net that is trained to be active for only that person's speech. By including speech from many people in the training data of each net this approach can directly model differences in people's speech. The chosen architecture and amount of training performed is shown to strongly affect the recognition performance. Large models with two hidden layers are shown to be inferior to models with only a single hidden layer and fewer weights. Recognition performance is shown to be comparable to that of a vector quantization approach based on personalized codebooks. The neural approach outperforms the codebook system for small model sizes but does slightly less well for larger models. A multitransputer implementation used in the training phase is described. Near linear speedup is obtained by splitting the training data to given independent subtasks, and a dynamic allocation scheme is used to assign these tasks to processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115617","startPage":"261","endPage":"264 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115617.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimisation of neural models for speaker identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training data","Speaker recognition","Neural networks","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","neural nets","speech recognition","transputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward models","neural models","speaker identification","speaker recognition","personalized neural net","training data","recognition performance","hidden layer","weights","vector quantization approach","personalized codebooks","model sizes","multitransputer implementation","training phase","linear speedup","independent subtasks","dynamic allocation scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Optimisation of neural models for speaker identification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","accessionNumber":"3853901","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimisation of neural models for speaker identification","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07578S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"24","articleId":"115617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":115621,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Two types of subword units were studied: phonelike units (PLUs) and acoustic segment units (ASUs). PLUs are based on phonetic transcriptions of spoken utterances and ASUs are extracted directly from the acoustic signal without use of any linguistic knowledge. The ASU representation has the advantage of not requiring transcriptions of training utterances. Verification performance was evaluated on a 100-talker database of 20000 isolated digit utterances. The experiments show only small differences in performance between PLU- and ASU-based representations. Overall, the verification equal-error rate is approximately 7 to 8% for one-digit test utterances (approximately 0.5 s in duration) and 1% or less for seven-digit test utterances (approximately 3.5 s in duration). In addition, a technique for updating models, using data from current test utterances, was devised and implemented. Using this adaptation technique, the error rate falls to 6% for one-digit utterances and less than 0.5% for seven-digit utterances. The experiment confirms that excellent verification performance can be obtained using HMMs of subword units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-word unit talker verification using hidden Markov models","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115621","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115621.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"272 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Sub-word unit talker verification using hidden Markov models","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853903","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-word unit talker verification using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043719S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"39","articleId":"115621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":115622,"authors":[{"name":"R.-H.

Based on the fine structure of the feature vector space, a statistically optimized distance measure is defined with weights equal to the partition-normalized inverse variance of cepstral coefficients. The weights can be adjusted individually for each partition and each component of the feature vector across all codebooks (speakers). Experiments on a 50-speaker database show that the suggested weighted cepstral distance measure works substantially better than the Euclidean cepstral distance or the inverse variance weighted cepstral distance. An accuracy of about 90% is achieved using a 16-level codebook in speaker verification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115622","startPage":"273","endPage":"276 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115622.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A weighted distance measure based on the fine structure of feature space: application to speaker recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weight measurement","Cepstral analysis","System testing","Speaker recognition","Vector quantization","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted distance measure","fine structure","feature space","speaker recognition","cepstral distance","speaker-based vector quantization","partition-normalized inverse variance","codebooks","speaker verification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"A weighted distance measure based on the fine structure of feature space: application to speaker recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","accessionNumber":"3853904","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A weighted distance measure based on the fine structure of feature space: application to speaker recognition","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026924S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"6","articleId":"115622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":115629,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Each speaker is represented by a set of feature vectors derived from speech segments belonging to different classes of phonemes. Linear predictive hidden Markov modeling and maximum-likelihood Viterbi decoding are applied to a speech utterance to obtain different classes of phonemes pronounced by a speaker. It is shown that different classes of phonemes are not equally effective in discriminating between speakers and that verification performance can be considerably improved by separately classifying speech segments representing each broad phonetic category as belonging to an impostor or as belonging to the true speaker. A weighted linear combination of scores for individual categories can be used as the final verification score. The weights are chosen to reflect the effectiveness of particular classes of phonemes in discriminating between speakers and are adjusted to maximize the verification performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115629","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115629.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable parameter speaker verification system based on hidden Markov modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115629/","displayDocTitle":"Variable parameter speaker verification system based on hidden Markov modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853906","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable parameter speaker verification system based on hidden Markov modeling","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024322S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"18","articleId":"115629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":115636,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The information in the correlogram is filtered, nonlinearly enhanced, and summed across channels. Peaks are identified and a pitch is then proposed that is consistent with the peaks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115684","startPage":"357","endPage":"360 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115684.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A perceptual pitch detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Testing","Autocorrelation","Humans","Power harmonic filters","Noise robustness","Face detection","Phase noise","Phase detection","Channel bank filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlators","hearing","speech intelligibility","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Licklider's duplex theory","perceptual pitch detector","human perceptual tests","inharmonic stimuli","noise","phase changes","cochlear model","autocorrelators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"A perceptual pitch detector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","accessionNumber":"3853925","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A perceptual pitch detector","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046015S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"47","articleId":"115684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":115686,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is shown that two fundamental problems in speech processing, dimensionality reduction and nonlinear temporal variability, can be addressed using geometrical methods from nonlinear dynamics. An effective dynamical system is extracted by training a nonlinear predictor of the signal samples. A variety of signal characteristics is then obtained from the properties of the resulting dynamical system such as the dimensionality and stability of its trajectories. The problem of time warping of speech is approached using a similar dynamical predictor, now acting directly on the acoustic features, provided that the magnitude of the time derivative of the feature vector is included in the predictor input. For the latter case the existence of a nonlinear predictor whose functional form is invariant with respect to nonlinear transformations of time is proven. The use of such dynamical predictors can replace or enhance existing methods for speech recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115686","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115686.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamical systems approach to speech processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"A dynamical systems approach to speech processing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3842932","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamical systems approach to speech processing","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057859S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"29","articleId":"115686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":115696,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is proven that Yen's interpolator can be obtained as a special case of an optimal frequency-domain design of its BFTF using a weighted least-square criterion. A practical interpolator, based on Yen's method, is considered for situations where the number of samples is large or infinite and the original Yen interpolation formula is inapplicable.

CWTs arise in the analysis of bandpass signals that are scale-time perturbed. To detect scale-time perturbed signals, the CWT of the received signal has to be computed with respect to the signals being detected. Efficient algorithms exist for the computation of the discrete wavelet transform, because the DWT wavelets give rise to quadrature mirror filters which can be implemented using lattice structures. Computation of the CWT with respect to an arbitrary wavelet (not necessarily a DWT wavelet), is time consuming. The DWT wavelets are used to compute the CWT of a signal with respect to an arbitrary wavelet. This is accomplished by using the computational properties of compactly supported DWT wavelet bases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115729.pdf","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1601 vol.3","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient computation of the wavelet transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal detection","Signal analysis","Mirrors","Band pass filters","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","time-domain analysis","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous wavelet transform","scale-time perturbed signals","discrete wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Efficient computation of the wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875651","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient computation of the wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034233S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"7","articleId":"115729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":115733,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The synthesis procedure is based on a generalized impulse response for the combining (modulating) and separation (demodulating) filters. In particular, the combining and separation filters are bandpass versions of one or two lowpass prototypes and are configured to cancel crosstalk by exploiting relationships between the center frequencies, delays, and phases in their impulse response. Based on the derived conditions, five different transmultiplexers are synthesized. Three of them implement orthogonal quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) with repeated center frequencies. The other two accomplish vestigial sideband modulation (VSB) with distinct frequencies. The transmultiplexers can be converted into new complementary subband systems. Intersymbol interference is eliminated in both the transmultiplexers and the subband systems by appropriately designing the prototypes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115743","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115743.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1642 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of bandwidth efficient OQAM and VSB transmultiplexers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115743/","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of bandwidth efficient OQAM and VSB transmultiplexers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875661","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of bandwidth efficient OQAM and VSB transmultiplexers","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034306S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"2","articleId":"115743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115744,"authors":[{"name":"K.-I.

The model uses a sequence of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as a separate nonlinear predictor for each class. It is designed to represent temporal structures of speech patterns as recognition cues. In particular, temporal correlation in successive feature vectors of a speech pattern is represented in the mappings formed as MLP input-output relations. Temporal distortion of speech is efficiently normalized by a dynamic-programming technique. Recognition and training algorithms are presented based on the combination of dynamic-programming and back-propagation techniques. Evaluation experiments were conducted using ten-digit vocabulary samples uttered by 107 speakers. A 99.8% recognition accuracy was obtained.

These experiments show that the spotting performance of the TDNN is high, while types of tendencies toward insertion and deletion errors are clarified. To reduce these spotting errors, integrated training methods using various training token positions are proposed. These methods allow the TDNN to correctly spot phonemes at a rate of 98.0% and also make it possible to realize large-vocabulary, vocabulary-independent speech recognition. To verify this, large-vocabulary speech recognition with 5240 common Japanese words was performed using a predictive LR parser.

HMMs, on the other hand, have the advantage that phone models can easily be concatenated to produce long utterance models, such as word or sentence models. The algorithm described combines the advantages inherent in each of these two algorithms. As the result of phoneme recognition experiments using a large vocabulary database of 5240 common Japanese words uttered in isolation by a male speaker, it is confirmed that the high discriminant ability of LVQ could be integrated into an HMM architecture easily extendible to longer utterance models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115756","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115756.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"492 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid speech recognition system using HMMs with an LVQ-trained codebook","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115756/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid speech recognition system using HMMs with an LVQ-trained codebook","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853928","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid speech recognition system using HMMs with an LVQ-trained codebook","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051952S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"16","articleId":"115756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":115757,"authors":[{"name":"L.T.

When the probability model fits the data well, MLE is better than MMIE if the training data are limited, but they are equal if there are enough data. When the model is a poor fit, MMIE is better than MLE. Training dynamics of MMIE and ANN are shown to be similar under certain assumptions.

Input feature vectors consist of single-frame linear predictive coding (LPC)-based cepstra and/or differenced cepstra. Classification accuracies using conventional k-means, class-specific k-means, and LVQ2 codebooks are compared for a 16-way speaker-independent vowel classification task. In contrast to speaker-dependent phonetic classification results previously published, no significant performance advantages are observed with LVQ2. These conflicting results are discussed relative to differences in the recognition tasks and the feature sets used. It is also argued that the single-observation Bayesian decision boundaries approximated by LVQ2 are nonoptimal for HMM-based classification involving multiple observations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115758.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"500 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-independent vowel classification using hidden Markov models and LVQ2","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Vector quantization","Neural networks","Linear predictive coding","Speech recognition","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","Markov processes","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","vowel classification","learning vector quantization","hidden Markov model","linear predictive coding","cepstra","LVQ2 codebooks","speaker-dependent phonetic classification","Bayesian decision boundaries"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-independent vowel classification using hidden Markov models and LVQ2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853930","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-independent vowel classification using hidden Markov models and LVQ2","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036176S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"17","articleId":"115758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115759,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-Q.

Consonant recognition experiments show that the organic combination of segmentation and TDNN improves not only phoneme identification performance but also segmentation accuracy.

For example, 16 QAM has three radii and 32 QAM has five radii. The algorithm uses the error between the equalizer output modulus and the nearest symbol radius to update the equalizer weights. The RDE algorithm provides faster convergence than the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for QAM signals and is independent of the carrier offset.

The difficulty stems from the nonlinear and recursive nature of the predictor, due to the inclusion of quantization in the filtering loop that achieves prediction. The classical stability constraints of linear filters are currently imposed on the loop filter. It is shown that these constraints are unnecessarily restrictive. For instance, when the loop filter is a one-order cell, its unique coefficient can overcross the value 1. In the second-order case, the coefficients a/sub 1/, a/sub 2/ may lie outside the stability triangle.

It is shown how the theory behind the recent work on QR decomposition (QRD)-based lattice filter algorithms can be applied to the wideband beamforming problem, and the computationally efficient QRD-based algorithm that results is described. The resulting architecture is essentially the same as the lattice of triangular arrays that has been derived, separately, by B. Yang and J.F. Bohme (1989) and by F. Ling (1989). The connection between these different approaches is reviewed. Also described is a simplified derivation of the QRD-based lattice algorithm that is applicable to both the adaptive filtering and the wideband beamforming problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3864366","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient QRD-based wide-band beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient QRD-based wide-band beamforming","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030089S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"5","articleId":"115839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":115843,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A number of authors have reformulated certain signal processing and linear algebra algorithms to be square-root-free in an effort to simplify parallel implementation. Following these derivations a number of Kalman filter algorithms and parallel array architectures have been realized that also avoid square-root computations. It is shown that, contrary to the motivation for realizing these algorithms, the standard algorithms (utilizing square roots) can be implemented more quickly than the square-root-free versions.

In an evaluation of the system for an isolated word recognition task, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to characterize the probability density functions of the acoustic signals from the different words in the vocabulary. Decoding is performed by applying the maximum aposteriori decision rule to the acoustic models. The HMMs are estimated by minimizing a differentiable cost function, which approximates the empirical error rate function, using the steepest descent method. The HMMs designed by the minimum empirical error rate approach were used in multispeaker recognition of the English E-set words and compared to models designed by the standard maximum-likelihood estimation approach. The approach increased recognition accuracy from 68.2% to 76.2% on the training set and from 53.4% to 56.4% on an independent set of test data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115867.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"712 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of hidden Markov model parameters by minimizing empirical error rate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Error analysis","Maximum likelihood decoding","Acoustic applications","Speech recognition","Training data","Character recognition","Probability density function","Vocabulary","Maximum a posteriori estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","Markov processes","parameter estimation","probability","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","hidden Markov model","empirical error rate","speech recognition","probability density functions","multispeaker recognition","English","E-set words"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of hidden Markov model parameters by minimizing empirical error rate","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853973","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of hidden Markov model parameters by minimizing empirical error rate","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042488S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"21","articleId":"115867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":115876,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The training algorithm of the resulting combined network is very simple since the component networks are trained in succession, starting from the Kohonen network, and the algorithms originally developed for them are used. The estimator is fully developed in connection with a determination of the shear velocity of the formation surrounding a fluid-filled borehole. The neural estimator is applied to synthetic seismograms out of the training set. In most of the cases a considerable improvement in estimation accuracy is obtained with respect to the Kohonen map. However, only a slight improvement in estimation accuracy is obtained with respect to the Kohonen map.

The investigation is based on several visual and objective comparative criteria, including the relevance to the motion information. Several pyramid transforms for image sequence coding are investigated and compared. The nonorthogonal pyramid transforms are separated from the orthogonal transforms. The nonorthogonal pyramid transforms are easily implemented, permit exact reconstruction, and accept the introduction of an error-compensation method if the different levels are coded but the nonorthogonality of the decomposition causes an increase in the number of transform samples and a high global entropy value (a disadvantage for data compression). The wavelet pyramid transform is more computationally complex but gives the best results for global entropy values. The quincunx pyramid seems to be the most interesting, since it features many advantages of the other including the visual representation of motion information through a pyramid sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laplacian pyramid versus wavelet decomposition for image sequence coding","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115894","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115894.pdf","startPage":"1965","endPage":"1968 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Laplacian pyramid versus wavelet decomposition for image sequence coding","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875709","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laplacian pyramid versus wavelet decomposition for image sequence coding","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027129S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"7","articleId":"115894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115898,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The method uses standard block motion-estimation techniques and assumes that each distinct velocity within a block is approximated by one of the motion estimates in a neighborhood of that block. A multiresolution approach to segmenting each block is taken. It is based on a Markov random-field model of the segmentation field and incorporates additional constraints which reflect an assumption that the blocks are small relative to objects in the scene. In order to avoid transmitting the segmentation, the method computes the segmentation of previous frames at the receiver and transmitter and predicts the current segmentation from past ones. Experimental results show that the method eliminates most artifacts due to block motion compensation at edges of moving objects and achieves 30-50% reductions in displaced frame-difference energy in frames where reliable motion estimates are available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115899","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1980 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive motion field segmentation for image sequence coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predictive motion field segmentation for image sequence coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115899/","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875712","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive motion field segmentation for image sequence coding","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029553S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"7","articleId":"115899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115900,"authors":[{"name":"K.-F.

Preliminary results showed that when the training set has a good coverage of the allophonic variations in the test set, both method are capable of high-performance recognition. However, under vocabulary-independent conditions, the method using tree-based allophones outperformed agglomerative clustering because of its superior generalization capability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3864192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Allophone clustering for continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allophone clustering for continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031841S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"26","articleId":"115900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":115906,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The lower bound for N*N images in which the norm of the Fourier transform magnitude (FTM) vector is dominated by DC and low-frequency components is shown to grow with N. The lower bound for images in which the elements of the FTM vector contribute more or less equally to its norm is 1. The problem of reconstruction from FTM and known phase in space domain is discussed. Since the introduction of sufficiently random space-domain phase results in flattened FTM distribution, the lower bound on the condition number of the reconstruction problem with respect to the FTM vector again becomes one. This is in agreement with experimental results, indicating that randomizing the phase in space domain improves the convergence rate of the Grechberg-Saxton algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115914","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115914.pdf","startPage":"2013","endPage":"2016 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of reconstruction of real and complex multidimensional signals from Fourier transform magnitude","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115914/","displayDocTitle":"Stability of reconstruction of real and complex multidimensional signals from Fourier transform magnitude","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875721","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of reconstruction of real and complex multidimensional signals from Fourier transform magnitude","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046155S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","articleId":"115914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":115917,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The design of the first hidden layer and of the Boolean output layer are discussed. The first procedure is basically a vector quantization of the pattern space that linearly separates all training patterns. Each cell in the vector quantization lattice is completely determined by a code address which is generated by the first hidden layer when only a pattern of the training set is supplied to the input of the neural network. The second problem is then to form a closed decision region as a Boolean function of cell addresses. A procedure is devised that minimizes this Boolean function by incorporation of free cells in the lattice, cells that are not addressed by the training patterns. It is shown that the second and succeeding hidden layers in a feed-forward network may therefore be replaced by a simple logical network. An algorithm for the design of this logical network is devised.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115941","startPage":"2081","endPage":"2084 vol.4","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115941.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network with Boolean output layer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115941/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network with Boolean output layer","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3875738","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network with Boolean output layer","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025098S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"2","articleId":"115941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":115946,"authors":[{"name":"C.I.

The second section acts as a multichannel adaptive noise canceller. The obtained noise references are typically very bad; hence, adaptation must be restricted to silence-only periods. Several ideas were explored for the first section. The most robust solution, and the one with the best sound quality, was given by the simplest solution, i.e. a delay and sum beamformer that cues in on the direct path only and neglects all multipath contributions.

The acoustical analyses, done at the phonetic level on about 40 parameters, showed significant differences in variability for male and female speakers. In addition to replicating previous studies, the authors investigated more parameters, and examined the influence of the Lombard effect on female speakers. Perceptual experiments, run for foreign listeners, exhibited a decrease of the intelligibility for some confusable subsets of the vocabulary studied. The findings are correlated with the performance of a DTW-based recognizer, and it is observed that recognition scores cannot necessarily be improved by reducing the variability for one specific parameter. It is also found that recognition scores are not directly related to the increase of the vocal effort and cannot be predicted from speech variability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115969","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","startPage":"841","endPage":"844 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic and perceptual studies of Lombard speech: application to isolated-words automatic speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic and perceptual studies of Lombard speech: application to isolated-words automatic speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115969/","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic and perceptual studies of Lombard speech: application to isolated-words automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034963S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"10","articleId":"115969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":115970,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

A technique of signal decomposition using hidden Markov models is described. This is a generalization of conventional hidden Markov modeling that provides an optimal method of decomposing simultaneous processes. The technique exploits the ability of hidden Markov models to model dynamically varying signals in order to accommodate concurrent processes, including interfering signals as complex as speech. This form of signal decomposition has wide implications for signal separation in general and improved speech modeling in particular. The application of decomposition to the problem of recognition of speech contaminated with noise is emphasized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115970","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115970.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","startPage":"845","endPage":"848 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov model decomposition of speech and noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov model decomposition of speech and noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115970/","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3853997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov model decomposition of speech and noise","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030321S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"210","articleId":"115970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":115971,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The algorithm is tailored for filter-bank-based systems, where the estimation seeks to minimize the distortion as measured by the recognizer's distance metric. This minimization is achieved by modeling the speech distribution as consisting of clusters; the energies at different frequency channels are assumed to be uncorrelated within each cluster. The algorithm was tested with a continuous-speech, speaker-independent hidden Markov model (HMM) recognition system using the NIST Resource Management Task speech database. When trained on a clean speech database and tested with additive white Gaussian noise, the recognition accuracy with the new algorithm is comparable to that under the ideal condition of training and testing at constant SNR.

Four architectures using the fast two-dimensional (2-D) algorithm for the DFT that achieve the maximum throughput per chip area are presented. The first two use N-element 2-D meshes requiring N+2N/sup 3/2/ multiplications and 1+2 square root N periods per DFT. The first uses in place data I/O and can be made systolic with Goertzel's algorithm. The second is systolic with row parallel I/O. The third and fourth architectures both use pipelined DFT blocks of length square root N connected by a pipelined matrix transposer. The third uses systolic 2-D meshes for the short DFTs with period square root N. The fourth uses pipelined butterfly networks implementing standard FFT algorithms for the short DFTs, but only N(1+log/sub 2/ N) multiplications per DFT, thus preserving maximum throughput per unit area.

The flexibility and modularity of the new 2-D FFT algorithm allows for a variety of sizes for the parallel 2-D FFT units. The decomposition of the 2-D FFT can be applied as many times as necessary until the right tradeoff between size and speed is obtained. The architecture offers an attractive tradeoff between size and speedup with an improvement of processor performance/size by over a factor of five.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115993","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00115993.pdf","startPage":"905","endPage":"908 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.115993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new parallel 2-D FFT architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=115993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/115993/","displayDocTitle":"A new parallel 2-D FFT architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3864211","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new parallel 2-D FFT architecture","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00115993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027434S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"1","articleId":"115993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-26"},{"_id":115995,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The results show that the codebooks generated by these two methods both enable low bits-per-pixel coding with low distortion. When using fewer training vectors, and when given a suboptimal initial codebook, the KNN method outperformed the LBG. For a theoretical lower bound, mean square error comparisons to an optimal N-level k-dimensional quantizer lower bound were made using a Gaussian source. As k increased, the KNN performance came quite close to the optimal quantizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116035/","accessionNumber":"3875789","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of the LBG algorithm and Kohonen neural network paradigm for image vector quantization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of the LBG algorithm and Kohonen neural network paradigm for image vector quantization","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045752S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"19","articleId":"116035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":116036,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A wavelet transform is first used in order to obtain a set of orthonormal subclasses of images; the original image is decomposed at different scales using a pyramidal algorithm architecture. The decomposition is along the vertical and horizontal directions and maintains the number of pixels required to describe the image at a constant. Second, according to Shannon's rate-distortion theory, the wavelet coefficients are vector quantized using a multiresolution codebook. To encode the wavelet coefficients, a noise-shaping bit-allocation procedure which assumes that details at high resolution are less visible to the human eye is proposed. In order to allow the receiver to recognize a picture as quickly as possible at minimum cost, a progressive transmission scheme is presented. The wavelet transform is particularly well adapted to progressive transmission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00116036.pdf","startPage":"2297","endPage":"2300 vol.4","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image coding using vector quantization in the wavelet transform domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Vector quantization","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Psychology","Frequency domain analysis","Pixel","Rate-distortion","Noise shaping","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","frequency-domain analysis","picture processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalar quantization","encoding","image coding","vector quantization","wavelet transform domain","image compression","psychovisual features","frequency domains","pyramidal algorithm architecture","Shannon's rate-distortion theory","multiresolution codebook","noise-shaping bit-allocation","progressive transmission scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Image coding using vector quantization in the wavelet transform domain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3875790","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image coding using vector quantization in the wavelet transform domain","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065729S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"64","articleId":"116036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":116041,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Halftoning is a nonstandard A/D conversion that is treated as an optimization problem, subject to a frequency-weighted mean-square-error (MSE) criterion. The frequency weight is implemented by means of a specific neural interconnection network based on current diffusion in resistive grids. This physical choice not only leads to a dramatically compact VLSI switch capacitor implementation, but also turns the whole process into a clean 2-D isotropic generalization of Sigma - Delta modulation. Isotropy and shift-invariance cooperate within the same halftoning process for the sake of image rendition.

Compressed images are stored in the server and transferred over the ISDN channel at 64 kb/s. This information is reconstructed at the client using a single 50-MHz AT&T WE DSP32C signal processor and auxiliary display hardware. Compression is accomplished using a 4 by 4 subband filterbank and a perceptual error measure operating in the subband domain. The perceptual measure determines what information can be discarded, with the rest quantized using differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), Huffman encoded and stored at the server. When retrieved, the client performs the inverse operations. A color image of 512 by 480 pixels can be compressed to 0.7 b/pixel, transferred to the client in 3 s, and reconstructed in 6 s, with results nearly indistinguishable from the original.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116043","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00116043.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"988 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of a color image decoder for remote database access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116043/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of a color image decoder for remote database access","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3864231","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of a color image decoder for remote database access","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027323S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"3","articleId":"116043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":116054,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

The pipeline processor has a constant geometry architecture. The throughput rate achievable with this pipeline architecture is R times the required processor and memory access rates. The new architecture eliminates the delay commutator switches which characterize the Purdy McClellan processor and replaces them with distributed random access memories and phase rotations at each stage to perform the data shuffling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Technological innovation","Geometry","Throughput","Delay","Switches","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","fast Fourier transforms","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","systolic arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","pipeline FFT","RAM","systolic phase rotation FFT","parallel processor architecture","FFT algorithm","data shuffle storage locations","recursive FFT","data channels","FFT processor","pipeline processor","throughput rate","pipeline architecture","memory access rates"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116067","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1024 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00116067.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The systolic phase rotation FFT-a new algorithm and parallel processor architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The systolic phase rotation FFT-a new algorithm and parallel processor architecture","accessionNumber":"3864240","publicationDate":"1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The systolic phase rotation FFT-a new algorithm and parallel processor architecture","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055014S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"11","articleId":"116067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":116084,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Using a straight-ahead target and a single off-axis jammer, source-to-microphone impulse responses were recorded from head-mounted arrays in anechoic and reverberant environments. Optimal filters (equivalent to the fully converged beamformer's adaptive filter) and associated system performance were computed for various filter structures and input target-to-jammer ratios. Generally, performance is sensitive to variations in filter length and filter primary-channel delay only under conditions of minimal reverberation and low target-to-jammer ratio. With realistic amounts of either reverberation or target, there is little sensitivity to filter length or primary channel delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116148/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3854008","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity to design parameters in an adaptive-beamforming hearing aid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity to design parameters in an adaptive-beamforming hearing aid","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061714S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"6","articleId":"116148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":116161,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

A theoretical discussion is followed by an original application. A special (index-free) tensor formalism to express fourth-order multivariate statistics is proposed. A quadricovariance tensor which contains the fourth-order joint cumulants is defined. In this formalism, the quadricovariance tensor and its eigen-matrices are natural fourth-order generalizations of second-order covariance and eigenvectors, allowing direct extension of many standard second-order method to fourth-order. The idea of an eigen-matrix is then proposed as a solution to the blind source separation problem. The task is to separate a mixture of N independent non-Gaussian signals received on an array of sensors when no information is available about propagation conditions or array geometry (blind situation). This can be achieved only by resorting to higher-order information. Quadricovariance eigen-matrices give a direct solution to this problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Sensor arrays","Higher order statistics","Blind source separation","Information geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","signal detection","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonGaussian signals","fourth-order cumulant tensor","blind source separation problem","fourth-order multivariate statistics","quadricovariance tensor","eigen-matrices","propagation conditions","array geometry"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116165","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116165","startPage":"2655","endPage":"2658 vol.5","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/132/3385/00116165.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1990.116165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116165/","displayDocTitle":"Eigen-structure of the fourth-order cumulant tensor with application to the blind source separation problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3875820","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigen-structure of the fourth-order cumulant tensor with application to the blind source separation problem","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040169S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"58","articleId":"116165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":116167,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The constraint is purposely chosen to permit signal distortion with the goal of achieving improved interference cancellation, motivating the term 'soft constrained' beamforming. The soft constrained minimum variance (SCMV) philosophy represents a trade of bias (signal distortion) for reduced variance (interference power). A key result is a proof guaranteeing that under ideal conditions the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a nondecreasing function of the bound on the mean squared response error. This implies that by allowing the signal distortion to increase the beamformer can provide much better interference cancellation, such that the SNR improves or remains constant. The potential SNR improvement resulting from the use of soft constraints is greatest for systems operating at broad bandwidths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3887050","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"Soft constrained minimum variance beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft constrained minimum variance beamforming","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032777S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"16","articleId":"116210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":116211,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Theoretical and Monte Carlo simulation analysis showed that at high array signal-to-noise ratios, since the adaptive beamformer could converge to the steady state, the order of processing did not make a difference in the overall system performance. However, the convergence of the adaptive beamformer at low array signal-to-noise ratios was affected by the change in signal environment due to the change of the order of processing.

The properties of this concept have since been proven useful for source bearing estimation problems in difficult situations. The propagator is a linear operator which can easily be extracted from the cross-spectral matrix of the signals received on the array without any eigendecomposition of this matrix. It is shown that the propagator method, used for the multiple source direction of arrivals estimation may have a theoretically asymptotical high resolution power. This is true if the noise correlation matrix is known except for a constant multiple as it is also required for the eigendecomposition-based methods. It is shown that a joint estimation of the propagator, the noise variance, and the number of sources can be performed and that the solution is unique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116246/","accessionNumber":"3887074","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On a high resolution array processing method non-based on the eigenanalysis approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a high resolution array processing method non-based on the eigenanalysis approach","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00116246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029068S","chronDate":"3-6 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"132","citationCount":"32","articleId":"116246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":116461,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The acquisition and bit error rate (BER) performances of this modem have been evaluated by computer simulation over an AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) and a Rician faded channel, and compared with a DE-QPSK demodulator with similar architecture. In an AWGN channel the TCM (trellis coded modulation) 8-PSK system is found superior to the DE-QPSK. In terms of the overall BER over realistic satellite channel conditions the two systems show comparable results because of the greater susceptibility of TCM schemes to carrier synchronization errors. However, the outage of the coded 8-PSK system is superior to the DE-QPSK one. The errors of the coded 8-PSK are characterized by short periods of high error rates with longer gaps of very low error rates. In contrast, the errors of the DP-QPSK system are distributed uniformly and occur more frequently.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison study of low bit rate DE-QPSK and TCM 8-PSK fully digital demodulators over a land mobile satellite link","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116542","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116542.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"392 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"A comparison study of low bit rate DE-QPSK and TCM 8-PSK fully digital demodulators over a land mobile satellite link","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976303","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison study of low bit rate DE-QPSK and TCM 8-PSK fully digital demodulators over a land mobile satellite link","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027248S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"3","articleId":"116542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":116543,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Suboptimal trellis search schemes promise much better general performance than decision feedback equalization (DFE) or linear equalization, M. Eyuboglu and S. Qureshi's (1989) reduced-state sequence estimation (RSSE) is the most general. It is shown that two reduced-search breadth-first trellis decoders, namely the M-algorithm and the newer T-algorithm, can provide performance equivalent to RSSE, but at a substantially reduced computational load. This advantage is especially pronounced for (minimum-phase) ISI responses with precursors. With the M or T-algorithms, a more powerful trellis code can be used to achieve a better error rate.

In order to achieve fast restoration, a distributed control mechanism that is applicable to both line and path restoration is proposed. The proposed method allows the shared use of spare channels for various failure scenarios, including multiple failure cases, so that the efficient use of spare channels can be achieved. A linear-programming-based scheme is proposed to obtain spare-channel assignment, where a network-flow technique is used.

B-SHRs with four fibers can be operated under today's operations environment without a significant change. However, U-SHRs using a path protection switching method may ease intervendor compatibility problems and can be implemented on a timely basis without changing the well-defined SONET APS protocol.

Concepts for improvement of the coding algorithms are discussed which might be the basis for future ISO activities aiming at a bit rate of only 2*64 kb/s for a stereo sound signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976319","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The ISO audio coding standard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ISO audio coding standard","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026535S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"28","articleId":"116564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":116566,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Closed-form expressions are presented for the optimized receiver coefficients, and for the bit-error rate (BER) in binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) or pi /4-offset QPSK.

An algorithm for determining the time instants of pitch periods within a short interval of periodic speech, which results in a time sequence of marker points that indicate the beginning of the pitch periods in the analyzed speech interval, is described. The LPC excitation is generated by a stochastic codebook for nonperiodic speech and by a single pulse per pitch period for periodic speech. The proper alignment of the excitation pulse is efficiently computed using dynamic programming. It is concluded that, at overall bit rates of around 3 kb/s, the coder produces significantly better speech quality than LPC10E, though the synthesized speech still sounds slightly buzzy for certain speakers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116641","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116641.pdf","startPage":"941","endPage":"945 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00116641.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-quality digital speech at 4 kb/s","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116641/","displayDocTitle":"High-quality digital speech at 4 kb/s","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976384","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-quality digital speech at 4 kb/s","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030148S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"11","articleId":"116641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":116643,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The model consists of three stages. The first stage is the pattern recognition task, in which an exemplar map that best meets the current network requirements is selected. The second stage is an analysis of the discrepancy between the chosen exemplar map and the state of the network, and adaptively modifies the chosen exemplar map to conform closely to the network requirement (input data pattern) by Kohonen's self-organization procedure. On the basis of certain performance criteria, it is decided in the third stage whether a new map is generated to replace the original map.

This bound is evaluated in a subscriber-loop system example to show the performance improvements that can occur over the situation in which the interference is stationary, but has the same mean power spectrum as the cyclostationary interferers.

Analysis and simulation studies with ideal decision feedback equalization (DFE) on a sample of loops within a carrier serving area (CSA) are presented. Self near-end crosstalk (NEXT) has been assumed to be the dominant source of external impairment. Simulation studies using a 64-point symbol rectangular constellation with a transmission rate of 1.6 Mb/s (in the vicinity of DS1 rate of 1.544 Mb/s) with a carrier frequency of 153.5 kHz and 10th-order Butterworth transmit and receive filters are presented for a sample of loops extracted from Bellcore's 1983 loop survey database. It is shown that a large improvement in SNR is required to make 1.544-Mb/s 64-point QAM a viable transmission technology for HDSL application in a CSA environment. The baseband PAM with 800-kb/s and 4-level code (2B1Q) has a performance which is, on the average, 5 dB superior to that of the simulated QAM across the tested loops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116684","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116684.pdf","startPage":"1172","endPage":"1176 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and performance evaluation studies of high bit rate digital subscriber lines (HDSL) using QAM and PAM schemes with ideal decision feedback equalization (DFE) within a carrier serving area (CSA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116684/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and performance evaluation studies of high bit rate digital subscriber lines (HDSL) using QAM and PAM schemes with ideal decision feedback equalization (DFE) within a carrier serving area (CSA)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976426","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and performance evaluation studies of high bit rate digital subscriber lines (HDSL) using QAM and PAM schemes with ideal decision feedback equalization (DFE) within a carrier serving area (CSA)","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034534S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"4","articleId":"116684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116686,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

It is found that at a conceptual level, this concatenation is straightforward. Multichannel modulation partitions the digital communication channel into a set of memoryless subchannels, each of which can be separately encoded and decoded. However, the approach is also found to be unacceptable in practice because of latency and complexity. Encoding/decoding methodologies that can be used to reduce latency significantly and that also use the same encoder on all subchannels are studied. It is shown that using multidimensional coset codes (four or eight dimensions) to achieve a granularity in bit distribution that will closely approximately the continuous distribution that is optimum is best. A loading algorithm is introduced for assigning bits and energies to the subchannels. It easily and quickly produces an overall modulated signal that is near optimum. The technique is illustrated using example channels based on a high-bit-rate digital subscriber line at 1.6 Mb/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116686","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116686.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1187 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A landing algorithm for the concatenation of coset codes with multichannel modulation methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116686/","displayDocTitle":"A landing algorithm for the concatenation of coset codes with multichannel modulation methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976428","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A landing algorithm for the concatenation of coset codes with multichannel modulation methods","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050828S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"9","articleId":"116686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":116690,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Analytically minimizing the variance of the importance sampling estimator with respect to the biasing parameters has only yielded solutions for systems for which the bit error rate (BER) could be found analytically (i.e., a linear system with additive Gaussian noise). A technique for finding a near-optional set of biasing parameters for the translation biasing scheme is presented. A key feature of this technique is that repetitive, very short simulation runs are used to determine near-optimal translation values. The method is also shown to exploit a theoretically justifiable relationship, for small sample sizes, between the BER estimate and the amount of translation. Only mild assumptions about the noise distribution and system are required. Experimentally, improvement factors ranging from three to eight orders of magnitude are obtained for different avalanche photodiode noise distributions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116690","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1221 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116690.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A useful and general technique for improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulation of digital communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"A useful and general technique for improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulation of digital communication systems","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3976433","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116690/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A useful and general technique for improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulation of digital communication systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041831S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"8","articleId":"116690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":116691,"authors":[{"name":"Cao Shigang","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Cao Shigang","id":"38222440400"},{"name":"Lin Jingdong","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Jingdong","id":"38224720500"},{"name":"Feng Chongxi","affiliation":["Department of Radio Electronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Feng Chongxi","id":"37064439800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-87942-632-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"116691","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Computational Intelligence Society","AWGN","Digital communication","Performance evaluation","Performance analysis","Satellite broadcasting","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","digital communication systems","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified efficient importance sampling","nonGaussian probability density function","simulation","MQAM systems","MEIS","bit error rate","digital communication systems","computer simulation","equivalent noise source","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation"]}],"abstract":"Modified efficiency importance sampling (MEIS), an importance sampling technique which can be used to yield a significant saving of run time for the assessment of bit error rate (BER) in digital communication systems using computer simulation, is described.

For every possible sequence that can be transmitted, the procedure finds the best possible channel fit corresponding to the noisy channel output sequence (typically using the least squares procedure). The data and the channel are estimated to be those with the overall best fit. This simple but exhaustive search procedure for blind channel equalization is noninstrumentable because of the exponential growth in its complexity with the length of the data sequence. The author proposes a suboptimal trellis search algorithm that strives to achieve the optimal performance with only a linear complexity. Fast convergence of the algorithm in estimating the channel is demonstrated for binary pulse amplitude modulation (2-PAM) and a variety of channels. Convergence at high signal-to-noise ratios (30 dB) typically occurs within 50 symbols for the channels considered. At a low SNR (10 dB), convergence occurs within 100 symbols. The number of states in the decoder trellis, which is a measure of the decoding complexity, is M/sup L/, where M is the number of modulation levels and L is the channel memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999392","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint data and channel estimation using fast blind trellis search techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data and channel estimation using fast blind trellis search techniques","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08833S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"48","articleId":"116770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":116771,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Since it has a nonlinear feedback loop, this loop is the bottleneck in high-data-rate implementations. It is shown that asymptotically the loop no longer has to be processed recursively, i.e. there is no feedback (resulting in negligible performance loss). This can be exploited to derive a purely feedforward method for Viterbi decoding, called the minimized method. It is demonstrated that the minimized method can be implemented very efficiently by a systolic architecture. This is shown on a chip design which achieves 600-Mb/s decoding speed per chip, for a K=3 convolutional code. By designing one cascadable module (chip), any speed up can be achieved simply by linearly adding modules to the implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Dynamic programming","Feedback loop","Convolutional codes","Performance loss","Chip scale packaging","Digital communication","Magnetic recording","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital signal processing chips","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimised method Viterbi decoding","dynamic programming","nonlinear feedback loop","high-data-rate implementations","feedforward method","systolic architecture","chip design","cascadable module","600 Mbit/s"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116778","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116778.pdf","startPage":"1712","endPage":"1716 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimized method Viterbi decoding: 600 Mbit/s per chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimized method Viterbi decoding: 600 Mbit/s per chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116778/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999402","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimized method Viterbi decoding: 600 Mbit/s per chip","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031299S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"12","articleId":"116778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":116780,"authors":[{"name":"T.-J.

B-ISDN uses the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technique for transporting voice, data, and video services. Currently, the ATM cell header size, functions, and adaption layer fields for data services are being standardized in CCITT. Error protection for data payloads will be provided by a per-cell CRC (cyclic redundancy check) field. Different data services may need different degrees of error protection. The authors discuss and analyze different options for error detection and correction by considering various schemes ranging from no error protection to only error detection. Based on the analysis and results presented, a per-cell CRC has been adopted in the adaptation layer for all data services. The per-cell CRC substantially improves cell misdelivery for all data services. For error-insensitive data services, single-bit correction over MID and segment-type fields improves cell loss substantially. At the same time, single-bit correction keeps cell misdelivery sufficiently low (1 in 10/sup 13/ in the worst case).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116785","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1757 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116785.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error detection and correction options for data services in B-ISDN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Error detection and correction options for data services in B-ISDN","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3999409","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116785/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error detection and correction options for data services in B-ISDN","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031968S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"1","articleId":"116785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":116788,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The correlation between successive received symbols is exploited to bound the error performance. The bound allows useful evaluation of coding gains on realistic communication systems without going into lengthy computer simulations. By further defining the maximum energy degradation factors, compact upper bounds are expressed in a way similar to the fully interleaved or memoryless channel. The maximum energy degradation factors are computed for a wide variety of mobile channel conditions. These factors give an interesting evaluation of the fading conditions and may be used to design coded communication systems on mobile channels. Independent space or frequency diversity may be taken into account in these bounds, and it is shown that the energy degradation is independent of this added independent diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116794","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116794.pdf","startPage":"1805","endPage":"1809 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of error control coding for mobile channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of error control coding for mobile channels","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976482","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of error control coding for mobile channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029993S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"9","articleId":"116794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":116796,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Several methods of sending an SV signal over the same fiber along with the line signal passes are examined. Transmission over 75 km along with a 1.8 Gb/s line signal is confirmed by modulating the pump light power of the optical amplifier (laser diode) with a 2 Mb/s bipolar signal, without degrading the line signal. The remaining pump light unabsorbed by the amplifying fiber carries the SV signal. Another method described is polarization modulation of line-signal light. A transmission experiment over a 1000 km fiber through 14 optical amplifiers confirms the applicability of polarization modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116801","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116801.pdf","startPage":"1846","endPage":"1850 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervisory signal transmission methods for optical amplifier repeater systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Supervisory signal transmission methods for optical amplifier repeater systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976487","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervisory signal transmission methods for optical amplifier repeater systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041569S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"15","articleId":"116801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":116804,"authors":[{"name":"M.Y.

The networks in question perform only linear operations on optical signals, essentially operating as a dynamically controlled 'ether' within which light beams are selectively directed between prescribed source-destination pairs.

Formulas for detection error probabilities are derived, and simulation results confirming the expected behavior of the detector are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116835","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116835.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2034 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear median based receiver for QAM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116835/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear median based receiver for QAM signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976513","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear median based receiver for QAM signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049333S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","articleId":"116835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116836,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Time-reversal operation is done by storing each block of received signal samples in a buffer and reversing the sequential order of the signal samples in time prior to equalization. As a result, the equivalent channel impulse response as seen by the DFE becomes a time reverse of the actual channel impulse response. The author describes useful performance bounds for such a receiver and studies important topics, including optimum symbol and burst timing recovery, and the combined use of equalization and diversity reception. Simulation results for a proposed receiver implementation that incorporates the time-reversal concept are presented. It is shown that a DFE with a very short forward filter can be effectively used to eliminate the effects of multipath time dispersion up to several symbols in duration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116836","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","startPage":"2035","endPage":"2039 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decision-feedback equalizer with selective time-reversal operation for high-rate indoor radio communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A decision-feedback equalizer with selective time-reversal operation for high-rate indoor radio communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116836/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976514","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decision-feedback equalizer with selective time-reversal operation for high-rate indoor radio communication","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031726S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","citationCount":"9","articleId":"116836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116839,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The analysis is performed taking into account the following topics: the influence of the dynamic range and quantization levels of the input signal and coefficients: the tracking and acquisition algorithm capabilities; comparison of DFE structures; and the extension of robust algorithms to DFEs. An experimental setup including a digital baseband equalizer is described. Results are reported for two kinds of DFE structures and a 16-AQM (quadrature amplitude modulation) modulation format. Specific problems related to the operation of DFEs in digital radio modems are discussed. It is established that the DFE structure is able to track continuous minimum-phase to nonminimum-phase transitions and vice versa without getting out of lock. This is an important result since the DFE outperforms current linear equalizers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116839","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] GLOBECOM '90: IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel5/516/3389/00116839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1990.116839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3389","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2055 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental results on digital decision feedback equalizers in a multilevel QAM digital radio system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental results on digital decision feedback equalizers in a multilevel QAM digital radio system","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116839/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3976517","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental results on digital decision feedback equalizers in a multilevel QAM digital radio system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00116839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034337S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1990","isNumber":"3389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"516","articleId":"116839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116849,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The presorting is done to identify seasonal boundaries and to categorized the day types. The technique is adaptive in that it internally generates the coefficients of relationships among the governing variables (weather parameters) and the load. As these relationships change over time, such coefficients are automatically updated. The resulting linear method is robust and fairly accurate. This technique was used to forecast the hourly loads for a week, using a 168 h lead time, in different seasons. The only forecast variable used was the dry-bulb temperature. When tested for historical data in the service area of a Virginia electric utility for four weeks in different seasons of the year, the average forecast error remained mostly under 4%. Only 23 individual errors, out of a total of 672 cases, exceeded 6%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","volume":"6","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4079639","displayDocTitle":"A priority vector based technique for load forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A priority vector based technique for load forecasting","sourcePdf":"00116990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038676S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"36","articleId":"116990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116992,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The index is obtained from numbers of line flow fluctuations in which the dominant mode is strongly observed even in the normal state of the system. To extract the index from the fluctuations, a combined technique is developed which is based on FFT (fast Fourier transform) processing and principal component analysis. The technique is applied to the field data which have been acquired at a single tie-line of a power system in Japan. The regression analysis with respect to the index and the total generation of the system shows that the damping effect of the system becomes strong with an increase of the total generation. This property, which is called a droop characteristic, could be used to determine the steady-state stability region and to identify whether the system is in the normal or alert state.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluctuations","Damping","Power systems","Data mining","Fast Fourier transforms","Principal component analysis","Power system analysis computing","Regression analysis","Steady-state","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","power systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["line flow fluctuation","power system damping","electromechanical oscillation","FFT","fast Fourier transform","single tie-line","Japan","regression analysis","droop characteristic","steady-state stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.116992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3394/00116992.pdf","startPage":"1473","endPage":"1479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.116992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new index extracted from line flow fluctuation to evaluate power system damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=116992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new index extracted from line flow fluctuation to evaluate power system damping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/116992/","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4079641","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new index extracted from line flow fluctuation to evaluate power system damping","sourcePdf":"00116992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038742S","chronDate":"Nov.  1991","isNumber":"3394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"5","articleId":"116992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":116998,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The main thrust is to explore the match between the algorithms, their implementation, and the machine architectures. For example, the less parallel but sequentially faster VDHN runs faster on the hypercube (iPSC/2) whereas the more parallel SOR-Newton requires data sharing more often because of the extra iterations and does better on the Alliant. The implementation on the hypercube requires significant manual programming to schedule the processors and their communication whereas the compiler in the Alliant recognizes parallel steps but only if the software is properly coded.

The sources of intersymbol interference include nonlinearity in the transmit laser, chromatic dispersion in systems operated at wavelengths other than the dispersion minimum of the fiber, polarization dispersion, and bandwidth limitations in the receiver. The authors discuss several techniques for reducing intersymbol interference in single-mode fiber systems with single-frequency lasers and show which techniques are appropriate at high data rates in direct and coherent detection systems. In particular, the performance of linear equalization, nonlinear cancellation, and maximum likelihood detection is analyzed. Computer simulation results for an 8 Gb/s system using measured laser and receiver characteristics showed that in direct detection systems, a 6-tap linear equalizer can reduce the penalty due to chromatic and polarization dispersion by more than 1 dB (or increase the dispersion-limited distance by more than 20%). Nonlinear cancellation and maximum likelihood detection can reduce the penalty even further, more than doubling the dispersion-limited distance in some cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117111.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"403 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical signal processing techniques in long-haul, fiber-optic systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Optical fiber polarization","Intersymbol interference","Fiber lasers","Chromatic dispersion","Maximum likelihood detection","Degradation","Bandwidth","Performance analysis","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","intersymbol interference","optical fibres","optical links","signal detection","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","direct detection","computer simulation","chromatic dispersion","long-haul fiber-optic systems","polarization dispersion","bandwidth limitations","single-mode fiber systems","single-frequency lasers","high data rates","coherent detection","linear equalization","nonlinear cancellation","maximum likelihood detection","polarization dispersion","8 Gbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Electrical signal processing techniques in long-haul, fiber-optic systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832277","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 19906","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical signal processing techniques in long-haul, fiber-optic systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029081S","chronDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"9","articleId":"117111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":117113,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The complete closed solution to the algorithm for each t<or=5 is presented as a set of decision trees.

The closed solution is more easily realized in hardware or software than the iterative algorithm, and it is shown by simulation that the closed solution is considerably faster even though some of the formulas are rather long. Also, the closed formulas can be proven correct, where it is almost impossible to totally verify an implementation of the iterative method.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117123","startPage":"458","endPage":"462 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117123.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed solution of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for fast decoding of BCH codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117123/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 19906","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"Closed solution of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for fast decoding of BCH codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3832285","publicationDate":"1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed solution of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for fast decoding of BCH codes","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050491S","chronDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"1","articleId":"117123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":117124,"authors":[{"name":"G.

However, the main unit of a VD contains a nonlinear data-dependent feedback loop that limits the maximum achievable throughput rate. A conventional realization of this loop leads to the problem that good decoder performance requires a large wordlength, whereas a high data rate requires a small wordlength. The authors present an architecture which eliminates this trade-off by bit-level parallel processing. The architecture was used in the design of a fabricated 115 Mb/s VD chip for an 8-PSK (phase-shift keying) trellis code. This represents the fastest single-chip VD built to date. The less complex design (<9000 gates) shows that the proposed architecture allows the single-chip realization of high-speed VDs with large wordlength and a larger number of states. It is shown that this architecture can also be applied to other related problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117124","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117124.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"467 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 100 Mbit/s Viterbi decoder chip: novel architecture and its realization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","displayDocTitle":"A 100 Mbit/s Viterbi decoder chip: novel architecture and its realization","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 19906","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3842552","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 100 Mbit/s Viterbi decoder chip: novel architecture and its realization","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042206S","chronDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"30","articleId":"117124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":117155,"authors":[{"name":"H.-J.

For tail probability estimation, two new nonlinear IS (NLIS) approaches are presented: shift of absolute values (SAV) and sample elimination (SE). In the case of linear systems with Gaussian input, the SAV method is shown to be uniformly more efficient than the linear techniques and very robust with respect to suboptimal parameterization. With respect to suboptimal choice of its parameter, the efficiency of the SE method is more sensitive than that of all other IS techniques discussed. Both NLIS methods are found to be easily implementable alternatives to the standard linear IS(LIS) techniques. The estimation of very-low-interval probabilities is considered as a new field for the application of IS techniques. The author presents both an LIS and an NLIS approach for this problem and provides performance analyses. A uniform bound on the required sample size is obtained for both techniques, thus emphasizing their high efficiency. Both methods are shown to be very robust with respect to suboptimal parameterization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Probability","Tail","Computational modeling","Discrete event simulation","Bit error rate","Random variables","Analytical models","Performance analysis","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication systems","probability","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling simulations","digital communication systems","zero-mean Gaussian input","nonlinear biasing techniques","tail probability estimation","shift of absolute values","sample elimination","linear techniques","suboptimal parameterization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117155","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117155.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"635 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear importance sampling techniques for efficient simulation of communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear importance sampling techniques for efficient simulation of communication systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117155/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832309","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear importance sampling techniques for efficient simulation of communication systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038828S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"7","articleId":"117155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":117177,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In order to resolve a certain degree of output-port contention, the switching fabric allows limited queueing at the output ports. Overflow at the output queues is prevented by the use of a backpressure mechanism and additional queuing at the input ports. The impact of the backpressure effect on the switch performance is analyzed for arbitrary output buffer sizes. The investigation is based on two performance measures: the average delay and the maximum throughput of the switch. Closed-form expressions for these measures are derived for both an asynchronous and synchronous operation model. The results demonstrate that a modest amount of output queuing provides significant delay and throughput improvements over pure input queuing. With reasonable output-buffer sizes, the ideal performance of infinite output queuing can be closely approached. The maximum throughput is the same for the synchronous and the asynchronous mode of operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117177","startPage":"747","endPage":"753 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117177.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of packet switches with input and output queueing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance of packet switches with input and output queueing","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3832324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117177/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of packet switches with input and output queueing","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02142S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"32","articleId":"117177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":117192,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A three-layer coding system was simulated where the codebook in the first layer is a standard VQ codebook and the codebooks in the other two layers are address codebooks with code vectors consisting of the addresses of the previous layer codebook. Simulation results demonstrate good quality reproduction at bit rates above 0.23 b/pixel for monochrome images and 0.35 b/pixel for RGB color images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117203","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117203.pdf","startPage":"893","endPage":"897 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-layer address-vector quantization technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"A multi-layer address-vector quantization technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3832334","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-layer address-vector quantization technique","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028194S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","articleId":"117203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":117212,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Attention is given to the subband coding system MUSICAM (masking-pattern universal subband integrated coding and multiplexing), which makes use of spectral and temporal masking effects and allows bit rates down to about 100 kb/s per monophonic channel, without impairing the subjective quality of the CD for any critical signal. With a bit rate of 64 kb/s the subjective quality comes close to that of the CD for most of the signals.

It efficiently integrates packetized voice and data traffic. Voice and data packets are queued separately, and the (T/sub 1/, T/sub 2/) scheme is used to facilitate dynamic bandwidth sharing and mutual overload protection between the two queues. T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ are time limits for transmitting voice and data packets continually while the voice and data queues are visited alternately. The scheme guarantees bandwidths to voice and data in the proportion of their respective time slice allocations, T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/. However, the bandwidth allocations are flexible in the sense that whenever one queue is exhausted, the transmission is immediately moved over to the other queue if it has a packet waiting to be served. The system also implements a voice block dropping scheme in which the less significant bits in voice packets are dropped during periods of congestion. The author presents results based on a simulation model which illustrate that the two schemes together provide the desired performance in terms of very good voice quality, low delay and packet loss, efficient use of transmission bandwidth, and protection in overload.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117225.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1009 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic bandwidth allocation and congestion control schemes for voice and data multiplexing in wideband packet technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic bandwidth allocation and congestion control schemes for voice and data multiplexing in wideband packet technology","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3842589","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic bandwidth allocation and congestion control schemes for voice and data multiplexing in wideband packet technology","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057607S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"42","articleId":"117225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":117227,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

The main properties of the algorithms of G.EMB are reviewed, and their performance for speech traffic is discussed. The embedded ADPCM algorithms allow the dropping of up to three least-significant bits to relieve congestion at any point between the transmitter and the receiver without the need to inform the receiving end. This bit dropping does not cause decoder divergence. Test results indicate that a mid-rise quantizer provides better voice transmission performance than its mid-tread counterpart when two bits are used in the feedback path. Subjective data show that the 40 kb/s mid-rise ADPCM algorithm with two feedback bits performs just as well as 64 kb/s PCM for up to four tandem encodings. G.EMB embedded algorithms are thus suitable for congestion control in multipoint and multinode network configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832351","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 19906","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Overview of CCITT embedded ADPCM algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of CCITT embedded ADPCM algorithms","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058536S","chronDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"6","articleId":"117227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":117275,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Harvey","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Harvey","id":"37273499900"},{"name":"S.B.

Each path through the decoding trellis is equivalent to a path through a weighted directed graph. Error patterns in decoded information blocks thus correspond to cycles in the graph. A sliding window is used to trap these cycles. The change in partial path metric across the window determines the reliability of the maximum likelihood path. If the maximum likelihood path is deemed unreliable, a retransmission request is generated. Implementation of this error trapping ARQ scheme requires only a minor modification of the Viterbi decoder. It is shown that the reliability of the data can be greatly improved while incurring only a small reduction in the throughput. The modified decoder is much more suited for applications where high data reliability is needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117275","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1274 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117275.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-trapping Viterbi decoding in type-I hybrid-ARQ","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","displayDocTitle":"Error-trapping Viterbi decoding in type-I hybrid-ARQ","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3832395","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117275/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-trapping Viterbi decoding in type-I hybrid-ARQ","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04472S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"3","articleId":"117275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":117277,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The transmission format follows GSM Recommendations for the pan-European digital mobile radio. Channel estimation is performed via correlation techniques, while channel equalization is achieved by means of maximum likelihood sequence estimation. Theoretical bounds on the bit error rate are derived, and their dependence on the channel model is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to analysis of the minimum Euclidean distance of sequence error events as a function of the number of paths as well as amplitude, phase shift, and delay of indirect paths. The capability of the MLSE receiver to cope with most propagation conditions is shown. The impact of an imperfect (i.e. noisy) channel impulse response estimate is evaluated, revealing a bit-error-rate degradation of a few decibels that was quite independent of the particular value of signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117288.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1350 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117288","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117288","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Narrowband","Time division multiple access","Land mobile radio","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal to noise ratio","GSM","Bit error rate","Euclidean distance","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","error statistics","mobile radio systems","telecommunication channels","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MLSE","narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","mobile radio channel","correlation techniques","channel equalization","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","bit error rate","channel model","minimum Euclidean distance","propagation conditions","channel impulse response","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117288/","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation and equalization for narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","accessionNumber":"3832405","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation and equalization for narrow-band TDMA mobile radio","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04729S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"3","articleId":"117288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":117292,"authors":[{"name":"C.-L.

The proposed multilevel system is based on demodulation of polarization-modulated signals by Stokes parameter detection, exploiting the property that each state of the transmitted signal can be represented by a point on a Poincare sphere. The transmitted states of polarization, can be represented by a point set on the Poincare sphere and must be chosen to minimize the error probability. The metric characteristics of the spherical surface allow the system performance for a given number of levels to be improved with respect to conventional multilevel systems, in which the representative points of the transmitted field states are bound to a line or part of a plane surface. A heuristic explanation is that on a spherical surface, when the number of points increases, the distance between them decreases more slowly with respect to multilevel systems working on plane metrics. Two fundamental problems of coherent optical systems are solved: polarization modulation ensures wide insensitivity to laser phase noise, while an electronic feedforward algorithm allows the state of polarization fluctuations due to single-model fiber birefringence to be compensated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1990.117343","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Including Supercomm Technical Sessions","pdfPath":"/iel2/123/3395/00117343.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1657 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1990.117343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel coherent optical system based on Stokes parameters modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117343/","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel coherent optical system based on Stokes parameters modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832443","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel coherent optical system based on Stokes parameters modulation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044607S","chronDate":"16-19 April 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","articleId":"117343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":117344,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This is obtained by stepping the polarization of the field between two orthogonal states at the same frequency as the bit rate. This approach is promising, avoiding complicated receivers, and particularly suitable for a distribution network where switching at the transmitter can be shared among several receivers, reducing system complexity. Computer simulations have been performed for both amplitude- and frequency-shift keying. Critical system parameters are examined and excess penalty is evaluated. In addition to square-wave modulation, sinusoidal modulation has been considered. An optimum value of the modulation depth exists for which the penalty is reduced with respect to the square-wave.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3832444","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 19906","displayDocTitle":"Polarisation independent detection by synchronous intra-bit polarization switching in optical coherent systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarisation independent detection by synchronous intra-bit polarization switching in optical coherent systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030427S","chronDate":"16-19 Apr 1990","isNumber":"3395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"123","citationCount":"12","articleId":"117344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":117345,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Attention is focused on power spectral containment within 5-kHz and 25-kHz communication satellite channels, measured relative interference levels in adjacent channels, vector rotation effects, and spectral performance as a function of shaping factor. The modulator features a direct digital synthesizer controlled by a digital signal processor. This combination allows simultaneous and independent control of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the modulated waveform, which is needed to prevent co-user satellite communication interference. This flexible, general-purpose modulator significantly increases the satellite user's flexibility by providing a variety of spectrally efficient PSK modulation waveforms that can be used at data rates up to 38.4 kb/s, while maintaining compatibility with lower-data-rate modems. The model is designed for UHF satellite communication and line-of-sight communication links.

The orthogonally polarized waves can suffer degradation due to carrier-to-cross-polarization interference (C/XPI). Particularly during multipath fading, such degradation would become intolerable. Different canceller structures are proposed to mitigate the effect of cross-polarization. Among these are the diagonalizer, the LMS, and the bootstrapped cancellers. The bootstrapped canceller has been implemented in different applications such as satellite dual-polarized communication, tactical communication, and QAM microwave radio. The probability of error performance of the bootstrapped cross-polarization canceller (BXPC) is studied and compared to the performance of other cancellers. The performance of the three cancellers is compared numerically for the 16 QAM with r=-10 dB, and -5 dB. It is shown that the LMS canceller outperforms the diagonalizers, particularly when the cross-coupling is high. Except for a very low signal-to-noise ratio, the BXPC outperforms the LMS with 64 QAM, more that with 16 QAM.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of LMS, diagonalizer and bootstrapped adaptive cross-pol cancellers for M-ary QAM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/125/3396/00117393.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"105 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of LMS, diagonalizer and bootstrapped adaptive cross-pol cancellers for M-ary QAM","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897868","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of LMS, diagonalizer and bootstrapped adaptive cross-pol cancellers for M-ary QAM","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035253S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"125","citationCount":"3","articleId":"117393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":117395,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The results of a study of the bit error rate (BER) performance of this coded system are presented. A representative set of the performance curves is shown. SFH is used because the differential signaling required only the phase of the previous received signal as a reference. Using DPSK eliminates the need to establish a phase reference for the hop, as with coherent signaling. From the results it is clear that the number of codeword symbols per hop must be small in order for the RS code to provide protection against jamming. Otherwise, no improvement over uncoded DPSK is gained. Lowering the symbols per hop can be achieved either by reducing the number of bits per hop, or interleaving the RS codewords to a depth determined by the hop length and RS code parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding for slow frequency hopped differential phase shift keying","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/125/3396/00117395.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"115 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Coding for slow frequency hopped differential phase shift keying","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for slow frequency hopped differential phase shift keying","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02572S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"125","citationCount":"3","articleId":"117395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":117403,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The characteristics of the DMF ASIC are summarized in tabular form. Three architectures are considered for the implementation of a DMF ASIC. First, there is the conventional trapped delay line architecture which requires a large adder tree. The second architecture is the systolic array DMF which consists of a number of identical stages cascaded together. The third architecture is the bank-of-correlators DMF, in which the reference code is recirculated around through the delay line. Since the objective is to maximize the length of the DMF, the tapped delay line architecture is selected. The tapped delay form is designed to support BPSK, QPSK, and OQPSK chip modulation. Matched filter lengths of up to 256 chips can be supported by cascading 4 ASICs. The DMF is designed as a gate array using an advanced double metal, 1.5 mu m CMOS process. The regularity of FIR filter architecture allows the core of the device to be laid out very compactly resulting in efficient usage of the gate array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Application specific integrated circuits","Sampling methods","Quadrature phase shift keying","Spread spectrum communication","Signal processing","Correlators","Telecommunications","Delay lines","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","delay lines","digital filters","logic arrays","matched filters","phase shift keying","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital matched filter ASIC","trapped delay line architecture","adder tree","systolic array","bank-of-correlators","reference code","BPSK","QPSK","OQPSK","chip modulation","gate array","1.5 mu m CMOS process","FIR filter architecture","1.5 micron"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117420","startPage":"235","endPage":"238 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/125/3396/00117420.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital matched filter ASIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital matched filter ASIC","accessionNumber":"3907861","publicationDate":"1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital matched filter ASIC","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.35695S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"125","citationCount":"8","articleId":"117420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":117438,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

The hop timing error causes phase imperfection, and therefore degrades system performance. The receiver utilizes a hop-timing tracking loop to lock the hop clock. Through this tracking loop, the differentially coherent demodulation of an FFH signal is made possible. The hop-timing error is modeled as a finite Markov chain, and error performance of this system in a phase-distorted channel is presented. The numerical results show that with proper parameters, the degradation due to phase imperfection caused by timing error is only about a fraction of one decibel additive white Gaussian noise in an (AWGN) environment. The grouping number should be increased when the phase distortion becomes more serious.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/125/3396/00117455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3396","startPage":"425","endPage":"429 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of fast frequency-hopped DBPSK spread spectrum communications in AWGN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of fast frequency-hopped DBPSK spread spectrum communications in AWGN","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117455/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3897898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of fast frequency-hopped DBPSK spread spectrum communications in AWGN","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060699S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"125","citationCount":"1","articleId":"117455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":117465,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The joint maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator has a computational complexity that is exponential in the total number of bits transmitted, and thus does not represent a practical solution to the problem. An estimator that combines a suboptimum tree-search algorithm with a recursive least-squares estimator of complex signal amplitude is considered. The complexity of this estimator is O(K/sup 2/) computations per decoded bit, and its performance is very close to that of the joint ML receiver. This receiver has the advantage that the transmitted signal powers and phases are extracted from the received signal in an adaptive fashion without the use of a test sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/125/3396/00117525.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"800 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Conference on Military Communications","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1990.117525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=117525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tree-search algorithm for signal detection and parameter estimation in multi-user communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Amplitude estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Recursive estimation","Phase detection","Phase estimation","Spread spectrum communication","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","parameter estimation","search problems","signal detection","spread spectrum communication","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser communication","asynchronous system","joint maximum likelihood estimator","signal phases","information bits detection","tree-search algorithm","signal detection","parameter estimation","direct-sequence spread-spectrum","multiple-access communication system","computational complexity","recursive least-squares estimator","complex signal amplitude"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/117525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"A tree-search algorithm for signal detection and parameter estimation in multi-user communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3916342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-3 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tree-search algorithm for signal detection and parameter estimation in multi-user communications","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00117525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048956S","chronDate":"30 Sep-3 Oct 1990","isNumber":"3396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"125","citationCount":"5","articleId":"117525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":117546,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The processing estimates the average multipath phase offset and rotates the complex samples at the correlator output to remove the estimated phase error.

The first scheme requires only one dynamic neural net which takes both computed input signals and measurable signals provided by sensors and predicts a combination of the plant parameters and inaccessible signals. In the second scheme two dynamic neural nets are connected in a reverse direction. The first neural net is used to detect possible failures in plant components or sensors, while the second net is used for the distinction between the two different kinds of failures. Both nets use only measured signals. One net literally simulates the inverse dynamics of the plant and possesses a physical meaning; therefore, it can be trained online.

By employing a Ti:LiNbO/sub 3/ external modulator and a fiber Gires-Tournois interferometer to equalize fiber chromatic dispersion, the penalty for 130 km transmission was held to only 0.9 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Optical interferometry","Optical receivers","Optical sensors","Optical pumping","Optical modulation","Optical fiber devices","Optical losses","Chromatic dispersion","Optical fiber losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","optical communication equipment","optical dispersion","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical pumping","transmission experiment","Er-doped fiber preamplifier","optical dispersion equalization","single-mode fiber","chromatic dispersion","receiver sensitivity","external modulator","fiber Gires-Tournois interferometer","8 Gbit/s","130 km","1.53 micron","1.3 micron","980 nm","LiNbO/sub 3/:Ti"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.118036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/3399/00118036.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.118036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"8-Gb/s-130 km transmission experiment using Er-doped fiber preamplifier and optical dispersion equalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"8-Gb/s-130 km transmission experiment using Er-doped fiber preamplifier and optical dispersion equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118036/","volume":"3","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4104837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"8-Gb/s-130 km transmission experiment using Er-doped fiber preamplifier and optical dispersion equalization","sourcePdf":"00118036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065466S","chronDate":"Dec.  1991","isNumber":"3399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"31","articleId":"118036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":118055,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The input is processed simultaneously at a coarse resolution throughout the image and at finer resolution within a small window. An approach for controlling the movement of the high-resolution window is described which allows for the unification of a variety of data and model-driven behavioral paradigms. Three modes have been implemented, one based on large unexplained areas in the data, one on conflicts in the object-model database, and one on a 2D space-filling algorithm. It is argued that this kind of multiresolution processing not only is useful in limiting the computational time, but also can be a deciding factor in making the entire vision problem a tractable and stable one. To demonstrate the approach, a class of 3D surface textures is introduced as a feature for recognition in the system considered. Surface texture recognition typically requires higher-resolution processing than required for the extraction of the underlying surface. As an example, surface texture is used to discriminate between a ping-pong ball and a golf ball.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.118055","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3400/00118055.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.118055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data and model driven foveation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Data and model driven foveation","isConference":true,"volume":"i","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3944324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118055/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data and model driven foveation","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03454S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"22","articleId":"118055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":118057,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The models are acquired automatically and initially approximated by polygons with multiple line tolerances for robustness. Groups of consecutive segments (supersegments) are then gray-coded and entered into a hash table. This provides the essential mechanism for indexing and fast retrieval. Once the database of all models is built, the recognition proceeds by segmenting the scene into a polygonal approximation; the gray code for each supersegment retrieves model hypotheses from the hash table. Hypotheses are clustered if they are mutually consistent and represent the instance of a model. The estimate of the transformation is refined. This methodology makes it possible to recognize models in the presence of noise, occlusion, scale, rotation, translation, and weak perspective. Unlike most of the current systems, its complexity grows as O(kN), where N is the number of models and k<<1/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient two dimensional object recognition","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.118057","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3400/00118057.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"17 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.118057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Efficient two dimensional object recognition","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3944326","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient two dimensional object recognition","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087953S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"31","articleId":"118057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118074,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed calibration procedure consists of two steps. In the first step, calibration parameters are estimated using a closed-form solution based on a distortion-free camera model. In the second step, the parameters estimated in the first step are improved iteratively through nonlinear optimization, taking into account camera distortions. According to minimum-variance estimation, the objective function to be minimized is the mean-square discrepancy between the observed image points and their inferred image projections computed with the estimated calibration parameters. A type of measure is introduced which can be used to directly evaluate the performance of the calibration and compare calibrations among different systems. The validity and the performance of the calibration procedure are tested on real images taken by wide-angle lenses. Results consistently show significant improvements over less complete camera models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.118105","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3400/00118105.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"253 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.118105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibration of stereo cameras using a non-linear distortion model (CCD sensory)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118105/","displayDocTitle":"Calibration of stereo cameras using a non-linear distortion model (CCD sensory)","volume":"i","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3936531","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibration of stereo cameras using a non-linear distortion model (CCD sensory)","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034146S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"30","articleId":"118105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":118138,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

In addition to surveying prior work in this area, they give practical advice to today's designers and users of statistical pattern recognition systems. It is pointed out that one needs a large number of training samples if a complex classification rule with many features is being utilized. In many pattern recognition problems, the number of potential features is very large and not much is known about the characteristics of the pattern classes under consideration: thus, it is difficult to determine a priori the complexity of the classification rule needed. Therefore, even when the designer believes that a large number of training samples has been selected, they may not be enough for designing and evaluating the classification problem at hand. It is further noted that a small sample size can cause many problems in the design of a pattern recognition system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3944406","volume":"i","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Small sample size effects in statistical pattern recognition: recommendations for practitioners and open problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small sample size effects in statistical pattern recognition: recommendations for practitioners and open problems","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034402S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"14","articleId":"118138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":118156,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Also described is a procedure for resolving the ambiguity in the boundary location resulting from the low-resolution segmentation process. This procedure makes use of a set of morphological filters and edges extracted at a higher resolution. The utility and accuracy of the method are demonstrated with a relatively complex example.

The methods have been tested on more than 1000 images from 17 patients with multiple sclerosis: however, they can also be used in other radiologic tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3400","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3400/00118169.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.118169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.118169","startPage":"583","endPage":"590 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation and feature extraction for magnetic resonance brain image analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118169/","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation and feature extraction for magnetic resonance brain image analysis","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","isConference":true,"volume":"i","accessionNumber":"3944428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation and feature extraction for magnetic resonance brain image analysis","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048632S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"12","articleId":"118169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118177,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The method is based on the fact that a single parameter space point can be determined uniquely with a pair, triple, or generally n-tuple of points from the original picture. Such n-tuples of points can be chosen randomly from the edge image, giving the method the name randomized Hough transform (RHT). The new algorithm reduces the computation time and memory use of the HT drastically. In the standard HT one must calculate one parameter curve in the parameter space for one pixel, whereas in the RHT only one parameter point has to be solved for one n-tuple of points, and the presence of a specific curve in the image is quickly revealed by the accumulation of a small number of parameter points.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Hough transform (RHT)","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.118177","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3400/00118177.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"635 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.118177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Hough transform (RHT)","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"i","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3957021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Hough transform (RHT)","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00118177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067345S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"38","articleId":"118177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":118200,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By imposing the consistency condition that the error minimization be equivalent to a likelihood maximization for training the network, the authors arrive at a Gibbs distribution on a canonical ensemble of networks with the same architecture. This statistical description enables them to evaluate the probability of a correct prediction of an independent example, after training the network on a given training set. The prediction probability is highly correlated with the generalization ability of the network, as measured outside the training set. This suggests a general and practical criterion for training layered networks by minimizing prediction errors. The authors demonstrate the utility of this criterion for selecting the optimal architecture in the continuity problem. As a theoretical application of the statistical formalism, they discuss the question of learning curves and estimate the sufficient training size needed for correct generalization, in a simple example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Neural networks","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilities","layered networks","learning","general input-output relation","neural network","statistical framework","consistency condition","error minimization","Gibbs distribution","training set","optimal architecture","statistical formalism","learning curves","training size"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118274","startPage":"403","endPage":"409 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118274.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent inference of probabilities in layered networks: predictions and generalizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consistent inference of probabilities in layered networks: predictions and generalizations","accessionNumber":"3578227","publicationDate":"1989","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":" 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent inference of probabilities in layered networks: predictions and generalizations","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035127S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"59","articleId":"118274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":118276,"authors":[{"name":"Gori","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, Florence, Italy"],"lastName":"Gori","id":"37275949300"},{"name":"Bengio","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Bengio","id":"37323338000"},{"name":"De Mori","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"De Mori","id":"37381894800"}],"articleNumber":"118276","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Neural networks","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning algorithm","dynamic nature","speech","backpropagation learning algorithm","dynamic neural networks","local feedback","input patterns","space","time","speech recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118276.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"423 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BPS: a learning algorithm for capturing the dynamic nature of speech","abstract":"A novel backpropagation learning algorithm for a particular class of dynamic neural networks in which some units have a local feedback is proposed.

It is concluded that recurrent nets and even time-delay nets might be invertible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118277","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","startPage":"425","endPage":"430 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inversion of multilayer nets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inversion of multilayer nets","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118277/","conferenceDate":" 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3578230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inversion of multilayer nets","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036097S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"127","articleId":"118277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":118281,"authors":[{"name":"White","affiliation":["Department of Economics, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"White","id":"37087462630"}],"articleNumber":"118281","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Neural networks","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["additional hidden unit test","nonlinearity","multilayer feedforward networks","statistical test","unknown mapping","nonlinear structure","approximation errors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118281","abstract":"The author presents a statistical test of the hypothesis that a given multilayer feedforward network exactly represents some unknown mapping subject to inherent noise against the alternative that the network neglects some nonlinear structure in the mapping, leading to potentially avoidable approximation errors.

The modifiable connection weights and the unit plane are realized by using a photorefractive crystal and a microchannel spatial light modulator, respectively.

The learning rate is optimally determined by setting the exposure time of the hologram based on the temporal characteristics of the photorefractive crystal. Next, the experiment is extended to the optical three-layer network. The optimal error signal for backpropagation learning is successfully generated. By incorporating the optical error signal into the network, the experiment of learning is performed. Due mainly to optical losses of the system related to the holograms and the unit planes, the projected performance is not fully realized. The preliminary experiment is individually conducted by partly disconnecting the optical interconnections between the optical elements.

The programming complexity of the algorithms is discussed and the results of some simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118371","startPage":"590 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118371.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network computational algorithms for least squares estimation problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Neural networks","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","neural nets","parameter estimation","state estimation","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","least squares estimation","Hopfield neural network model","minimum variance estimators","energy functions","parameter estimation","state estimation","programming complexity","simulation experiments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","displayDocTitle":"Neural network computational algorithms for least squares estimation problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3601782","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network computational algorithms for least squares estimation problems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018642S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"9","articleId":"118371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118375,"authors":[{"name":"L.

A neural network computation algorithm is introduced to solve the optimal traffic routing in a general N-node communication network. The algorithm chooses multilink paths for node-to-node traffic which minimize a certain cost function (e.g. expected delay). Unlike the algorithm introduced earlier in this area, the knowledge about the number of links (hops) between each origin-destination pair is not required by the algorithm, therefore it can be applied to a more general network. The neural network structure for implementing the algorithm is a modification of the one used by the traveling salesman algorithm.

Adaptive splines can be used to construct smooth approximations to unknown functions as data are received online. When the adaptive spline is multidimensional with a large number of knot points, the computational requirements of conventional implementations can limit the utility of an adaptive spline approach. Artificial neural networks have shown that multidimensional nonlinear functions can be learned from training data by adjusting the weights of simple neuron-like processing elements. It is shown that by formulating the problem using B-spline receptive field excitation functions the computational architecture of a CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) neural network is naturally suited for implementing adaptive splines and learning the spline coefficients. The use of B-spline receptive field excitation functions also enables higher order CMAC neural networks to be developed that can learn both functions and function derivatives. This ability coupled with the computational efficiency of a CMAC neural network will allow the real-time construction of multidimensional functions and their Jacobian matrices on traditional computing architectures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118387","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118387.pdf","startPage":"595 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of adaptive B-splines using CMAC neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","displayDocTitle":"Development of adaptive B-splines using CMAC neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3601798","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of adaptive B-splines using CMAC neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027649S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"3","articleId":"118387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":118398,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is commonplace in connectionist/neural-net models to include winner-take-all (WTA) networks for selecting a single, most active subnetwork out of a set of competing, interconnected subnetworks. However, there is also a need for subnetwork selection, that is on a totally arbitrary basis. To implement arbitrary selection the authors propose temporal winner-take-all (TWTA) networks. A TWTA network includes an arbiter that chooses a winner on the basis of the arrival times of signals from the contending subnetworks. The differences in the arrival times can be due to quasi-random, intuitively meaningless differences between the generation times of the signals and/or the travel times of different signals on their way to the arbiter. The process of arbitrary selection generally involves several repeated attempts at choosing a winner. A probabilistic analysis shows that a winner is almost certain to emerge after a few tries at most, under reasonable settings of parameters. Also, a preliminary version of a developing connection machine simulation of the proposed TWTA network has yielded promising results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118398","startPage":"599 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118398.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal-winner-take-all networks for arbitrary selection in connectionist and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118398/","displayDocTitle":"Temporal-winner-take-all networks for arbitrary selection in connectionist and neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3601809","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal-winner-take-all networks for arbitrary selection in connectionist and neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146463S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"2","articleId":"118398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118421,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

First, conventional approaches to target recognition used at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) are reviewed. Next, the application of neural networks to target recognition at AFIT is examined. Two classification tests are reported. In the first, the task is to label an object either target or nontarget. The neural network approach achieved 89% accuracy on the training data and was 75% correct on the test data. In the second test, the network learns to classify objects as either tank, truck, or armoured personnel carrier. An accuracy of 98% on the training data was recorded and 85% on the test set.

An enhanced parallel toroidal lattice architecture for neurocomputers is proposed. The performance of the architecture is almost proportional to the number of node processors. It uses the most efficient two-dimensional processor connections implemented by the VLSI technology to date and also has even greater expandability of performance and capacity of neurocomputers. The authors define the general neuron model that is the basis of the toroidal lattice architecture. Then they take a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a typical example of neural networks and describe the simulation of the MLP using error backpropagation learning algorithms on virtual processors with the toroidal lattice architecture. Then, mapping from the virtual processors to physical node processors with the same toroidal lattice architecture is done by row and column partitions. At the same time, the row and column permutations are carried out for node-processor load balancing. Finally, the authors study the feasibility of simulating large-scale neural networks with 1 million neurons and 10 billion connections using toroidal lattice architecture node processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118454","startPage":"614 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118454.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced parallel toroidal lattice architecture for large scale neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Microprocessors","Neural networks","Parallel architectures","Virtual computers","Very-large-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","microprocessor chips","neural nets","parallel architectures","virtual machines","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["row partitions","enhanced parallel toroidal lattice architecture","large scale neural networks","neurocomputers","node processors","two-dimensional processor connections","VLSI","neuron model","multilayer perceptron","error backpropagation learning algorithms","virtual processors","column partitions","node-processor load balancing","large-scale neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced parallel toroidal lattice architecture for large scale neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3601859","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced parallel toroidal lattice architecture for large scale neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033802S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"3","articleId":"118454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":118455,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A novel approach for a learning process of multilayer perceptron neural networks using the recursive-least-squares (RLS) technique is proposed. This method minimizes the sum of the square of the errors between the actual and the desired output values recursively. The weights in the net are updated upon the arrival of a new training sample by solving a system of normal equations using the matrix inversion lemma. To determine the desired target in the hidden layers an analog of the backpropagation strategy used in the conventional learning algorithms is developed. This permits the application of the learning procedure to all the other layers. Simulation results on an exclusive-OR example are obtained which indicate significant (an order of magnitude) reduction in the total number of iterations when compared with those of conventional techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118511","startPage":"623 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118511.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast learning process of multi-layer neural nets using recursive least squares technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118511/","displayDocTitle":"Fast learning process of multi-layer neural nets using recursive least squares technique","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3601888","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast learning process of multi-layer neural nets using recursive least squares technique","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027985S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"12","articleId":"118511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":118514,"authors":[{"name":"O.K.

The experiments performed in comparison to multilayered networks with backpropagation training indicated the superiority of the HNN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118514","startPage":"624 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118514.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical neural network involving nonlinear spectral processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Parallel architectures","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","parallel architectures","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical neural network","nonlinear spectral processing","nonlinear transformation","input vectors","classification","learning","parallel architectures","multilayered networks","backpropagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical neural network involving nonlinear spectral processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3601892","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical neural network involving nonlinear spectral processing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026335S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"4","articleId":"118514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118549,"authors":[{"name":"T.-C.

A novel neural model called SPAN (space partition network), which allows the network to adapt its structure autonomously, is proposed. According to the evolution level operators and their selection rules to be defined, a network can generate new neurons and connect them on desired positions in the network when the processing capability of the network is not sufficient, or the network can annihilate nonactive existent neurons. Using this algorithm, the authors initially put a set of seed neurons in the network, then let the network grow according to the training patterns. It is observed from the simulation results that the network will eventually grow to such a configuration which is suitable to the class of problems characterized by the training patterns, i.e. the neural network self-synthesizes itself to fit the problem space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118549/","accessionNumber":"3601907","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SPAN: a neural network that grows","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPAN: a neural network that grows","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018083S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"3","articleId":"118549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118553,"authors":[{"name":"Kosko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems Signal and Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kosko","id":"37087691955"}],"articleNumber":"118553","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calculus","Associative memories","Learning systems","Neural networks","Noise","Stability","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calculus","content-addressable storage","learning systems","neural nets","noise","stability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive feedback","nonadaptive feedback","noise","structural stability","real-time unsupervised learning","feedback dynamical systems","Ito-Stratonovich stochastic calculus","globally stable feedback systems","reliability","biological plausibility","random adaptive bidirectional associative memory","Hopfield circuit","ART-2 model","signal velocity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118553","abstract":"The structural stability of real-time unsupervised learning in feedback dynamical systems is demonstrated with the Ito-Stratonovich stochastic calculus.

An ATM network is a high-speed packet-switching network for the data transmission layer of B-ISDN (broadband integrated services digital network) which provides multimedia services, including voice, data and video. Service quality control is one of the most crucial issues in realizing a flexible ATM network. It is a challenging research task to build an efficient network controller that can control the network traffic even when the precise characteristics of the source traffic are not known and the service quality requirements change over time. The proposed ATM network controller is flexible in function and simple in implementation because neural networks using backpropagation learn the relations between the offered traffic and service qualities. A training data selection method called leaky pattern tables is proposed for learning the accurate relations. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated by simulation of a basic call regulation model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3589849","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ATM communications network control by neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM communications network control by neural network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027554S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"25","articleId":"118589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":118590,"authors":[{"name":"Worth","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Worth","id":"37087419919"},{"name":"Spencer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Spencer","id":"37087419454"}],"articleNumber":"118590","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Closed loop systems","Learning systems","Neural networks","Robots","Tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","learning systems","neural nets","robots","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back propagation","neural network","tactile sensing","Hertzian contact problem","local closed-loop gripper control","hidden-layer network","cylindrical finger","embedded sensor array","cylindrical rod"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118590","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118590.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"267","endPage":"274 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network for tactile sensing: the Hertzian contact problem","abstract":"A neural network has been developed for use with local closed-loop gripper control using a tactile sensor array.

However, by selecting this threshold setting, detections of small and medium size targets can be missed. An old but previously impractical technique for improving performance was to use all contacts from several scans and employ a very large bank of matched filters. This could achieve a detection on one or more of all possible target trajectories formed from stored contacts for each input detection. Neural network hardware offers new opportunities to implement such techniques. It is shown that feedforward and graded-response Hopfield neural networks can implement the optimum postdetection target track receiver. For the Hopfield net, the spurious states correspond to the important case of multiple track detection. Finally, the author presents simulations that show that substantial signal-to-noise gain can be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118591","startPage":"275","endPage":"282 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118591.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for extraction of weak targets in high clutter environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Neural networks","Radar clutter","Virtual computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","neural nets","radar clutter","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weak targets","high clutter environments","detection device","false-alarm rate","matched filters","stored contacts","feedforward","graded-response Hopfield neural networks","postdetection target track receiver","multiple track detection","signal-to-noise gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for extraction of weak targets in high clutter environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3589850","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for extraction of weak targets in high clutter environments","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061709S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"7","articleId":"118591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118592,"authors":[{"name":"Decatur","affiliation":["Ground Systems Group Neural Network Technology Center, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Decatur","id":"37087420017"}],"articleNumber":"118592","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Radar applications","Virtual computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","neural nets","radar applications","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","terrain classification","radar terrain","Bayesian classification","maximum-likelihood estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118592","abstract":"Results of an investigation into the applicability of neural networks to the classification of radar terrain images are reported.

In all gaits disruptions of sensory information can often be compensated for by central information, and vice versa.

The input to the NN is an intensity modulated signal, which is a measure of the power of the received signal plus noise at different frequencies as time varies. Thus, a two-dimensional array (image) is to be examined to reach a decision. It is assumed that the target emits a sinusoidal signal at a fixed frequency f/sub 0/. If the target moves with a constant speed with respect to the receiver, the received signal frequency will be (1+ delta ) f/sub 0/, where delta is the Doppler shift. The received two-dimensional image is first thresholded to obtain a binary (0 or 1) image. The first stage of the proposed system consists of an autoassociative memory (ASM) whose function is to eliminate the noise and reconstruct the received signal. The output of the ASM is input to the second stage of the system, which consists of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The MLP outputs a decision regarding the presence or absence of the targets. Results of an initial experimental study are reported. A promising classification accuracy of 97% for targets and 100% for no-targets has been obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118605/","accessionNumber":"3589858","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Target detection using a neural network based passive sonar system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target detection using a neural network based passive sonar system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037148S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"10","articleId":"118605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118606,"authors":[{"name":"Principe","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Principe","id":"37087584227"},{"name":"Tome","affiliation":["Departamento de Electronica, University de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"lastName":"Tome","id":"37088022458"}],"articleNumber":"118606","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Learning systems","Biomedical computing","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","learning systems","medical computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training strategies","feedforward neural networks","sleep scoring","multilayer perceptrons","training conditions","feature vectors","sleep staging","human scorer","single-layer perceptron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118606","abstract":"A comparison is made of the performance of single- and multilayer perceptrons in the scoring of sleep stages under different training conditions.

The neural network performed at the same level as other much more difficult to implement pattern recognition schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118606","startPage":"341","endPage":"346 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118606.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and training strategies in feedforward neural networks: an application to sleep scoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118606/","displayDocTitle":"Performance and training strategies in feedforward neural networks: an application to sleep scoring","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3589859","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and training strategies in feedforward neural networks: an application to sleep scoring","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038234S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"10","articleId":"118606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118607,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Because the classifier is independent of the data distribution, the accuracy of classification does not require making any statistical assumptions. The reference addresses in MSDM are regular and dense instead of random and sparse as in sparse distributed memory. The random-address array is absent in an MSDM. The MSDM classifies patterns of small integers (smaller than 32) instead of binary numbers. Pattern similarity and address selection may be measured by a Euclidean rather than a Hamming distance. A learning procedure is first presented for the MSDM. Then a scheme for classifying multispectral images with large number of bands is described. The test results show that the MSDM is able to classify multispectral images with very high accuracy. The speed of classification by MSDM is totally competitive with the minimum distance classification (MDC), which currently remains one of the fastest traditional methods. However, MDC is not very accurate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Associative memories","Memory architecture","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","content-addressable storage","memory architecture","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","memory architectures","neural nets","content addressable storage","Kanerva's sparse distributed memory","Euclidean distance","trainable pattern classification","universal classifier","reference addresses","learning","multispectral images","minimum distance classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118607","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118607.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"349 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast trainable pattern classification by a modification of Kanerva's SDM model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast trainable pattern classification by a modification of Kanerva's SDM model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118607/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3601616","conferenceDate":" 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"-  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast trainable pattern classification by a modification of Kanerva's SDM model","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039152S","chronDate":"-  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"8","articleId":"118607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":118610,"authors":[{"name":"Tsutsumi","affiliation":["Division of System Science, The Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"lastName":"Tsutsumi","id":"37088025314"}],"articleNumber":"118610","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118610","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","multilayered neural network","Hopfield nets","internal space representation","backpropagation","energy minimization","mapping networks","learning","indirect feedback loop","manipulator configuration control","shortest pass","obstacles","distance measure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118610","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118610.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"365","endPage":"371 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilayered neural network composed of backpropagation and Hopfield nets and internal space representation","abstract":"A multilayered neural network composed of backpropagation and Hopfield nets is proposed. In the network, the Hopfield net provides energy minimization, and two backpropagation nets put in front and in the rear of the Hopfield net function as mapping networks with learning capability. The input signals from the environment are mapped via one backpropagation net (BPN) into the internal space, where the Hopfield net minimizes the total energy according to the internal space representation. The output signals of the Hopfield net are mapped again to the environment via the other backpropagation net (BPN/sup -1/) with an inverse mapping. The indirect feedback loop via BPN/sup -1/ and BPN can be used if the constraints must be satisfied according to the distance measure in the environment. Simulation studies for manipulator configuration control show that the proposed network helps the end of the manipulator to reach the target point through the shortest pass in the internal space. Then parameters such as the constraints for the link lengths and the distances between the joints and the obstacles are conserved according to the distance measure not in the internal space but in the workspace.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118610/","accessionNumber":"3601619","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A multilayered neural network composed of backpropagation and Hopfield nets and internal space representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilayered neural network composed of backpropagation and Hopfield nets and internal space representation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067928S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"11","articleId":"118610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118611,"authors":[{"name":"Chauvin","affiliation":["Psychology Department, Stanford University, Thomson CSF, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chauvin","id":"37088027122"}],"articleNumber":"118611","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118611","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Neural networks","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","principle component analysis","gradient descent","constrained linear Hebbian cell","linear computing unit","variance maximization","local maximum","saddle points","global minimum","cost landscape","hyperspheres","hypercrests","hypervalleys","learning trajectory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118611","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118611.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"373","endPage":"380 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principal component analysis by gradient descent on a constrained linear Hebbian cell","abstract":"The behavior of a linear computing unit is analyzed during learning by gradient descent of a cost function equal to the sum of a variance maximization and a weight normalization term.

The functional properties of such hidden-layer bottlenecks are analyzed, and a method for dynamically creating them, concurrent with backpropagation learning, is described. The method does not excise hidden units; rather, it compresses the dimensionality of the space spanned by the hidden-unit weight vectors and forms clusters of weight vectors in the low-dimensional space. The result is a functional bottleneck distributed across many units.

Although protein acting forces guide neurite growth and synapse formation, neuronic firing rates are responsible for synaptic efficacies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118623","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118623.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"496 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable neural nets by energy convergence learning principle based on extended McCulloch-Pitts neurons and synapses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable neural nets by energy convergence learning principle based on extended McCulloch-Pitts neurons and synapses","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3601637","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable neural nets by energy convergence learning principle based on extended McCulloch-Pitts neurons and synapses","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068172S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"16","articleId":"118623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118624,"authors":[{"name":"Tagliarini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Tagliarini","id":"37088024483"},{"name":"Page","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"lastName":"Page","id":"37087740302"}],"articleNumber":"118624","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning in systematically designed networks","abstract":"The authors describe a network design methodology that is capable of specifying the structure of neural networks that are predisposed to satisfy the syntactic constraints of problems. This methodology is observed to produce networks that might also be vulnerable to certain unfeasible equilibria.

The result is an adaptation of the Hopfield model that can learn to generate only solutions to the original problem. As a consequence of the fact that the network has been predisposed to find solutions, learning can take place without producing a training set prior to the training session. Furthermore, training only occurs when a solution is found, and since the set of solutions is typically much smaller than the total number of possible states, training time is reduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118624","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"497","endPage":"502 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118624.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematically designed networks","network design methodology","neural networks","syntactic constraints","training strategy","Hopfield model","learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning in systematically designed networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118624/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3601638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":" 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning in systematically designed networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02817S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"7","articleId":"118624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118625,"authors":[{"name":"Naft","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Naft","id":"37088024985"}],"articleNumber":"118625","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Neural networks","Operations research","Optimization methods","Printed circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","neural nets","operations research","optimisation","printed circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","PC design","operations research","NEUROPT","neurocomputing","multiobjective design optimization","printed circuit board component placement","traveling salesman problem","wire-length criteria","thermal reliability","Hopfield energy function","neural network simulator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118625","abstract":"The traveling salesman problem (TSP) can be mapped to the problem of optimal component placement for printed circuit boards (PCBs).

The Hopfield cost function can be modified by introducing terms to model the wire-length and thermal reliability for alternative component placements.

The positive results of that testing, the potential for a dramatic improvement in the time needed to calculate such optimal placements, and the natural way of extending the formulation to include more design criteria lead to a confidence that similar approaches will have a significant impact on multiobjective design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118625","startPage":"503","endPage":"506 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118625.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEUROPT: neurocomputing for multiobjective design optimization for printed circuit board component placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118625/","displayDocTitle":"NEUROPT: neurocomputing for multiobjective design optimization for printed circuit board component placement","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3601639","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEUROPT: neurocomputing for multiobjective design optimization for printed circuit board component placement","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051281S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"16","articleId":"118625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118626,"authors":[{"name":"Foo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, FAMU/FSU College of Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Foo","id":"37088024438"},{"name":"Szu","affiliation":["Naval Research Laboratory, Inc., Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"lastName":"Szu","id":"37087960861"}],"articleNumber":"118626","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Operations research","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","operations research","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operations research","large-scale optimization","divide-and-conquer neural networks","traveling-salesman problems","cut-and-splice algorithm","convergence","local minimum tour","global final tour","single-layer modified Hopefield-Tank neural network algorithm","partitioning","energy landscape"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118626","abstract":"The authors present a neural network algorithm that is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy for solving large-scale traveling-salesman problems (TSPs). This ad hoc cut-and-splice algorithm utilizes a two-layer network with a partitioned first layer and a combining second layer. The cities of a large-scale TSP are first divided into clusters or local sets. Each local city set is represented by a neural network in the first layer, which upon convergence yields the local minimum tour. The second layer optimizes the interconnections between the local sets, forming a global final tour. The regional global (or local) minima of each cluster can be combined to form the global minima of the overall energy functions. Results of the cut-and-splice algorithm are compared with those of the single-layer modified Hopefield-Tank neural network algorithm. The invariant property is confirmed in the sense that the sum of the energy fixed points is equal to that of the fixed points of its parts, and the sum is insensitive to the partitioning of the energy landscape. This means that the linear boundary perturbation created by the partitioning is relatively small as the quadratic area of the problem increases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118626","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118626.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"511 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving large-scale optimization problems by divide-and-conquer neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Solving large-scale optimization problems by divide-and-conquer neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3601640","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving large-scale optimization problems by divide-and-conquer neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026616S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"11","articleId":"118626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118628,"authors":[{"name":"Van den Bout","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Van den Bout","id":"37320729400"},{"name":"Miller","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Miller","id":"37382381800"}],"articleNumber":"118628","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"A new algorithm, called mean field annealing (MFA), is applied to the graph partitioning problem.

The MFA algorithm is developed in the context of the graph partitioning problem.

The temperature behavior of MFA during bipartitioning is analyzed and shown to have an impact on the tuning of neural networks for improved performance.

The global-local minima issue is addressed and solved in two steps. First, the initial X-Y condition from which the system is permitted to evolve toward minima is determined by solving a relaxed problem that has global minima located in regions of the state space close to those of the original problem. Second, the initial orientation of blocks is determined by a more detailed analysis of connectivity requirements.

The present authors obtain identical conclusions but do not require the hidden-unit activation to be sigmoid. Instead, it can be a rather general nonlinear function.

For a preliminary demonstration of these concepts, a simulation in which a two-link manipulator is taught how to make a tennis-like swing has been constructed. The control system first determines how to make a successful swing using rules alone. It then teaches a neural network how to accomplish the task by having the network observe and generalize on rule-based task execution. Following initial training, a rule-based execution monitor evaluates the neural network performance and reengages rule-based swing-maneuver control whenever errors due to changes in the manipulator or its operating environment necessitate retraining of the network. The rule-based system thereby ensures proper task completion while neural network relearning takes place. The simulation shows the interaction between rule-based and network-based system components during various phases of training and supervision.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118652","startPage":"683","endPage":"688 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118652.pdf","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of knowledge-based system and neural network techniques for autonomous learning machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge based systems","Learning systems","Neural networks","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","learning systems","neural nets","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","knowledge-based system","neural network","autonomous learning machines","rule-based system","two-link manipulator","swing-maneuver control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Integration of knowledge-based system and neural network techniques for autonomous learning machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3601641","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of knowledge-based system and neural network techniques for autonomous learning machines","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052905S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"5","articleId":"118652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118653,"authors":[{"name":"Reid","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Intelligent Systems Technology Branch, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Reid","id":"38184969700"},{"name":"Spirkovska","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Intelligent Systems Technology Branch, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Spirkovska","id":"37389994900"},{"name":"Ochoa","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Intelligent Systems Technology Branch, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ochoa","id":"38227092600"}],"articleNumber":"118653","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","invariance","neural nets","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","invariant pattern recognition","accuracy","translational position","scale factor","network architecture","backpropagation"]}],"abstract":"The authors demonstrate a second-order neural network that has learned to distinguish between two objects, regardless of their size or translational position, after being trained on only one view of each object. Using an image size of 16*16 pixels, the training took less than 1 min of run time on a Sun 3 workstation. A recognition accuracy of 100% was achieved by the resulting network for several test-object pairs, including the standard T-C problem, for any translational position and over a scale factor of five. The second-order network takes advantage of known relationships between input pixels to build invariance into the network architecture. The use of a third-order neural network to achieve simultaneous rotation, scale, and position invariance is described. Because of the high level of invariance and rapid, efficient training, initial results show higher order neural networks to be vastly superior to multilevel first-order networks trained by backpropagation for applications where invariant pattern recognition is required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118653","endPage":"692 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118653.pdf","startPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid training of higher-order neural networks for invariant pattern recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118653/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid training of higher-order neural networks for invariant pattern recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":" 1989","accessionNumber":"3601642","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid training of higher-order neural networks for invariant pattern recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027394S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"29","articleId":"118653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118659,"authors":[{"name":"Eckhorn","affiliation":["Physics and Biophysics Department, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"lastName":"Eckhorn","id":"37087583296"},{"name":"Reitboeck","affiliation":["Physics and Biophysics Department, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"lastName":"Reitboeck","id":"37087581471"},{"name":"Arndt","affiliation":["Physics and Biophysics Department, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"lastName":"Arndt","id":"37087582264"},{"name":"Dicke","affiliation":["Physics and Biophysics Department, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany"],"lastName":"Dicke","id":"37087579905"}],"articleNumber":"118659","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visual system","Neural networks","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye","neural nets","physiological models","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual perception","neural nets","physiological models","stimulus-evoked oscillations","visual cortex","global coherent percepts","resonance state","global stimulus","cortical linking features"]}],"abstract":"Until recently, no known physiological mechanism could explain the transient linking of local visual features into global coherent percepts. The authors have found such principles at a 'computational stage' of preattentive processing in the cat's primary visual cortex. The results show that stimulus-evoked oscillations of local processing units, representing local visual features, are transiently locked into a common resonance state by an appropriate global stimulus. The experimental results suggest further that the activities of those neural groups that represent features that are to be linked in the current visual situation become synchronized. Synchronization was found among assemblies in a single cortex column (where similar local features are processed) and, more important, among remote assemblies of the same cortex area and even among assemblies in different areas when the assemblies share some common local visual features. These cortical linking features are considered to be the neural representations of the corresponding perceptual linking features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118659","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118659.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"730 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature linking via stimulus-evoked oscillations: experimental results from cat visual cortex and functional implications from a network model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Feature linking via stimulus-evoked oscillations: experimental results from cat visual cortex and functional implications from a network model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":" 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3601647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature linking via stimulus-evoked oscillations: experimental results from cat visual cortex and functional implications from a network model","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038062S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"53","articleId":"118659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":118661,"authors":[{"name":"Akazawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Akazawa","id":"37087988951"},{"name":"Kato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Kato","id":"37087989417"},{"name":"Fujii","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Fujii","id":"37087987084"}],"articleNumber":"118661","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological control systems","Muscles","Neural networks","Nervous system","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","muscle","neural nets","neurophysiology","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physiological models","neural network model","force control","size principle","motor unit","motor cortex","motoneurons","muscle","isometric force","Renshaw cells"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118661","abstract":"A neural network model consisting of a single motor cortex output cell, alpha -motoneurons, Renshaw cells, and muscle units is presented.

Using hierarchically organized modular subnetworks, which are trained separately and in parallel, the complexity of the task is reduced by effectively dividing it into subgoals. The system uses sequential natural language input and output and develops its own I/O representations for the words. The representations are stored in an external global lexicon and are adjusted in the course of training by all four subnetworks simultaneously, according to the FGREP-method. By concatenating a unique identification with the resulting representation, an arbitrary number of instances of the same word type can be created and used in the stories. The system is able to produce a fully expanded paraphrase of the story from only a few sentences, i.e. the unmentioned events are inferred. The word instances are correctly bound to their roles, and simple plausible inferences of the variable content of the story are made in the process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118677/","accessionNumber":"3601665","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A modular neural network architecture for sequential paraphrasing of script-based stories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modular neural network architecture for sequential paraphrasing of script-based stories","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033128S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"19","articleId":"118677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118680,"authors":[{"name":"Iwata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng., Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Iwata","id":"37088024178"},{"name":"Nagasaka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng., Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Nagasaka","id":"37088022416"},{"name":"Suzumura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng., Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Suzumura","id":"37088024281"}],"articleNumber":"118680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Digital measurements","Electrocardiography","Learning systems","Biomedical computing","Neural networks","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","computerised instrumentation","computerised signal processing","data compression","digital instrumentation","electrocardiography","learning systems","medical diagnostic computing","neural nets","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual three layer networks","digital IC memory card","electrocardiogram","arrhysmia's detection","digital Holter monitoring system","data compression algorithm","digital Holter recording","artificial neural networks","hidden layer","supervised signals","back propagation learning algorithm","ECG waveform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118680","abstract":"A data compression algorithm for digital Holter recording using artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed.

To allow the construction of networks with arbitrary architectures, CMOS VLSI building-block components (e.g. arrays of neurons and synapses) have been designed. These can be cascaded to form networks with hundreds of neurons per layer. A 64-channel multiplexer input neuron chip serves to buffer stored charges for injection into the first synaptic layer. A 32*32 synapse chip design uses multiplier circuits to generate a conductance from stored analog charges representing weights. A 32-channel variable-gain neuron chip applies an adjustable-gain sigmoidal activation function to the sum of currents from the previous synaptic layer. Learning is performed by a host computer that can download weights and inputs onto the feedforward hardware, and read resultant network outputs. Weights and input values are stored as charges on on-chip capacitors; these are serially and invisibly refreshed by off-chip circuits that convert values stored in digital memory into analog signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/842/3401/00118697.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"190 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International 1989 Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1989.118697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of parallel hardware neural network systems from custom analog VLSI 'building block' chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","Learning systems","Neural networks","Parallel architectures","Very-large-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","hybrid computers","learning systems","neural nets","parallel architectures","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel hardware","neural network systems","custom analog VLSI","learning algorithms","arbitrary architectures","CMOS VLSI","building-block components","neurons","multiplexer input neuron chip","synapse chip design","multiplier circuits","stored analog charges","variable-gain neuron chip","sigmoidal activation function","feedforward hardware","on-chip capacitors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","displayDocTitle":"Design of parallel hardware neural network systems from custom analog VLSI 'building block' chips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3614813","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of parallel hardware neural network systems from custom analog VLSI 'building block' chips","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036601S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"47","articleId":"118697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":118698,"authors":[{"name":"Holler","affiliation":["Technology Development, Novel Device Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Holler","id":"37369859700"},{"name":"Tam","affiliation":["Technology Development, Novel Device Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tam","id":"37270388100"},{"name":"Castro","affiliation":["Technology Development, Novel Device Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Castro","id":"37330760400"},{"name":"Benson","affiliation":["Technology Development, Novel Device Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Benson","id":"37381593300"}],"articleNumber":"118698","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":278,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":1379},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Analog memories","Learning systems","Memory architecture","Multiplying circuits","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computer circuits","analogue storage","learning systems","memory architecture","multiplying circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrically trainable networks","four quadrant multiplication","artificial neural network","analog storage","multiply characteristics","floating-gate synapse","architecture","signed analog voltage","stored weight","differential current","sigmoid function","multilayer networks","weight-change pulses","CMOS EEPROM technology","1 micron"]}],"abstract":"The use of floating-gate nonvolatile memory technology for analog storage of connection strengths, or weights, has previously been proposed and demonstrated.

The basic idea of the image representation is the use of intermediate products of the neural recognition system in the brain. The authors suppose it to be an internally represented image (IRI) of the outer world. It is recollected by the symbolic representation of the corresponding fact and is operated to produce the internal prospects of an operation. The process corresponds to the knowledge representation and the operation on it in artificial intelligence. According to the idea of operations on IRI, an iterative process of recognition, i.e., recollection, operation is applied to the problem of image understanding. Using the model of selective attention, an image of multiple targets with position shift and deformation is separated into the components of each target sequentially.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/118704/","accessionNumber":"3601683","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image understanding by neuron network-representation and operation of internal image","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image understanding by neuron network-representation and operation of internal image","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00118704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023377S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"3401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"842","citationCount":"2","articleId":"118704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":118707,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Department of EE-Systems, University of Southern California, USA"],"lastName":"Zhou","id":"37087604870"},{"name":"Chellappa","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Department of EE-Systems, University of Southern California, USA"],"lastName":"Chellappa","id":"37087490783"}],"articleNumber":"118707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","neural nets","pattern recognition","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing","batch neural network algorithms","motion stereo","depth information","recursive neural network algorithms","bias inputs","recursive least square algorithm","disparity values","real-time vision system","detection algorithm","occluding pixels"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=118707","abstract":"Motion stereo infers depth information from a sequence of image frames. Both batch and recursive neural network algorithms for motion stereo are presented. A discrete neural network is used for representing the disparity field. The batch algorithm first integrates information from all images by embedding them into the bias inputs of the network. Matching is then carried out by neuron evaluation. This algorithm implements the matching procedure only once, unlike conventional batch methods requiring matching many times. The method uses a recursive least square algorithm to update the bias inputs of the network. The disparity values are uniquely determined by the neuron states after matching. Since the neural network can be run in parallel and the bias input updating scheme can be executed on line, a real-time vision system employing such an algorithm is very attractive. A detection algorithm for locating occluding pixels is also included.

In order to estimate the multilayered neural network's ability for pattern recognition, an experiment was carried out on handwritten numeral recognition. Three kinds of neural networks were used. One is a basic multilayered neural network in which each hidden unit is connected to all input units. Another has each hidden unit connected to input units in a local area of a character.

The network energy function is constructed so that its minimum corresponds to the minimum least square error between actual and desired joint velocities. At each sampling time, connection weights and neuron states are updated according to current joint positions. During each sampling period, the energy function is minimized and joint velocity command signals are obtained as the states of the Hopfield network.

A Monte Carlo device simulator featuring a suitable band model for high-energy electrons is used. An interesting finding is that at very short channel lengths the high energy tail of the electron distribution function, the most important quantity in determining hot-carrier reliability, is controlled by the applied bias and not by local electric fields.

Data for induction motors are often not available in the form required by the equivalent circuit. An efficient method is therefore needed to find the resistances and reactances in the equivalent circuit from the data normally available. The method should be flexible enough to be applied both when complete current, torque, and power factor vs. slip curves are available and when only a few points on these curves are known. Using the method described, the induction machine equivalent circuit impedances can be found from the normally available information. The method involves some calculations which can be computerized, but also requires engineering judgment during the solution process. The computer program structure facilitates the necessary computer-engineer interaction. The method is iterative, and an interactive computer program relieves the engineer of much of the computational burden. Also discussed is the appropriate level of induction motor modeling for various types of dynamic studies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Analytical models","Equivalent circuits","Torque","Reactive power","Induction machines","Impedance","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","equivalent circuits","induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor","performance characteristics","equivalent circuit modeling","resistances","reactances","current","torque","power factor","slip curves","impedances","computer program"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.119235","startPage":"959","endPage":"965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/3416/00119235.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.119235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tailoring induction motor analytical models to fit known motor performance characteristics and satisfy particular study needs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Tailoring induction motor analytical models to fit known motor performance characteristics and satisfy particular study needs","accessionNumber":"4027489","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","volume":"6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tailoring induction motor analytical models to fit known motor performance characteristics and satisfy particular study needs","sourcePdf":"00119235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023368S","chronDate":"Aug.  1991","isNumber":"3416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"43","articleId":"119235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":119237,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

To reach an optimal commitment strategy under the fuzzy environment, a fuzzy dynamic programming model in which the hourly loads, the cost, and system security are all expressed in fuzzy set notations is developed.

In this algorithm, the rule of parameter estimation is used to maximize the recognition accuracy or to minimize the probability of error of the recognizer which is based on hidden Markov models instead of maximizing the likelihood function in maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). The performance of minimum probability error (MPE) estimates is better than that of MLEs. Since MPE is much more complex in computation than an MLE, a simplified implementation of MPE which is much more moderate in computation is given. Experiments on speech recognition based on HMMs show that the accuracy of the recognizer trained by the estimation method has about a 5% improvement over the MLE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.1990.119323","publicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990] Proceedings. 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/301/3418/00119323.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"30 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.1990.119323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new method for estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119323/","displayDocTitle":"A new method for estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","volume":"ii","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3944505","conferenceDate":"16-21 June 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new method for estimation of hidden Markov model parameters","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00119323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049486S","chronDate":"16-21 Jun 1990","isNumber":"3418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"301","citationCount":"3","articleId":"119323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":119325,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The RBN compression in which algorithm is a segmentation algorithm in which a picture is subdivided into regions with equal properties and for each region only the relevant information for the human eye is kept. Thus, the compressed image consists of segmentation information and the information of the picture behavior in those regions. The picture is subsampled on a quadtree based lattice (segmentation information). The inner pixels are approximated with the use of four lattice corner pixels (pictorial behavior). The subdivision in blocks has to be a function of the image contents. The size of the initial blocks is 65*65. Each pixel in the block is approximated as a weighted average of the four corner pixels (bilinear interpolation). The efficient VLSI architecture used to implement the algorithm is termed the lowly multiplexed cooperating data-path style.

Light in the cavity is assumed to circulate in the form of traveling photon packets, in which the photon number fluctuates due to the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, absorption, scattering, and reflection. The dipole dephasing time T plays a critical role in modeling the interaction of the photon packets and gain medium. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the temporal behavior of a continuously pumped Fabry-Perot laser. The laser output power is found to exhibit periodic fluctuations at the cavity transit time frequency (longitudinal mode beat frequency). The amplitude of these fluctuations, as well as the relaxation oscillation, which occurs at a much lower frequency, is strongly influenced by the magnitude of T. The results of these simulations are related to the temporal behavior expected from a conventional FP laser.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.119506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/3419/00119506.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","doi":"10.1109/3.119506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantum amplifier model for predicting temporal variations in the output power from a semiconductor laser on a picosecond time scale","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1992","displayDocTitle":"A quantum amplifier model for predicting temporal variations in the output power from a semiconductor laser on a picosecond time scale","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1992","accessionNumber":"4123459","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantum amplifier model for predicting temporal variations in the output power from a semiconductor laser on a picosecond time scale","sourcePdf":"00119506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038847S","chronDate":"Jan 1992","isNumber":"3419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","articleId":"119506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":119508,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

It is found that two different sources are responsible for the four-wave mixing: the carrier density modulation and the nonlinear gain effect. The latter is clearly observed when the detuning frequency increases above 100 GHz. The nonlinear gain coefficient epsilon , which induces a gain grating through the pump-probe beating, is estimated to be 1.75*10/sup -23/ m/sup 3/. The change in the real refractive index associated with the nonlinear gain effect, which generates an index grating, is negligibly small. The relaxation time involved in the nonlinear gain effect is found to be less than 0.3 ps.

Particular attention is paid to model reference, pole placement, and linear quadratic controller structures. Designs and analyses of model reference, pole placement, and linear quadratic controllers, based on combining the corresponding controller structures with the various robust adaptive laws, are presented.

The shaping gains obtained with more complicated codes approach the ultimate shaping gain of 1.53 dB. With a feedback-free syndrome-former for C/sub s/, transmitted data can be recovered without catastrophic error propagation. Constellation expansion and peak-to-average energy ratio may be effectively limited by peak constraints. With lattice-theoretic constellations, the shaping operation may be characterized as a decoding of an initial sequence in a channel trellis code by a minimum-distance decoder for a shaping trellis code based on the shaping convolutional code, and the set of possible transmitted sequences is then the set of code sequences in the channel trellis code that lie in the Voronoi region of the trellis shaping code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119687.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis shaping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Trellis shaping","volume":"38","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4170829","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119687/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis shaping","sourcePdf":"00119687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032847S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"276","articleId":"119687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":119688,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

Trellis precoding may be viewed as a generalization of trellis shaping to Gaussian ISI channels, or, alternatively, as a generalization of TH precoding, with coded modulation that achieves shaping gain. With trellis precoding channel capacity can be approached essentially as closely on any strictly bandlimited, high signal-to-noise ratio Gaussian channel as on the ideal channel, using the same coding techniques. For first- and second-order FIR and IIR (finite and infinite impulse response) channels, it is shown that shaping gains close to 1 dB can be obtained with a two-dimensional four-state trellis code.

Recursive representations are established that are equivalent to the original field. This is achieved by first presenting a canonical representation for GMRFs that is based on the inverse of the covariance matrix, which is called the potential matrix. It is this matrix rather than the field covariance that reflects in a natural way the MRF structure. From its properties, two equivalent one-sided representations are derived, each of which is obtained as the successive iterates of a Riccati-type equation. For homogeneous fields, these unilateral descriptions are symmetrized versions of each other, the study of only one Riccati equation being required. It is proven that this Riccati equation converges at a geometric rate, therefore the one-sided representations are asymptotically invariant. These unilateral representations make it possible to process the fields with well-known recursive techniques such as Kalman-Bucy filters and two-point smoothers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119691.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.119691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive structure of noncausal Gauss-Markov random fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Covariance matrix","Riccati equations","Signal processing algorithms","Markov random fields","Filters","Image processing","Signal processing","Iterative algorithms","Senior members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","information theory","Markov processes","matrix algebra","random processes","recursive functions","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","noncausal Gauss-Markov random fields","canonical representation","covariance matrix","potential matrix","Riccati-type equation","homogeneous fields","one-sided representations","unilateral representations","recursive techniques","Kalman-Bucy filters","two-point smoothers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Recursive structure of noncausal Gauss-Markov random fields","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4170833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive structure of noncausal Gauss-Markov random fields","sourcePdf":"00119691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062977S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"88","articleId":"119691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":119692,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A unifying view of cumulant and polyspectral discriminant measures utilizes these lags and provides a common framework for development and performance analysis of novel and existing estimation and classification algorithms.

For any fixed (small) rate, and for a sufficiently large alphabet, the codes thus obtained lie above the Zyablov bound.

The goal of this work is to develop guidelines for implementing discrete and continuous wavelet transforms efficiently, and to compare the various algorithms obtained and give an idea of possible gains by providing operation counts. Most wavelet transform algorithms compute sampled coefficients of the continuous wavelet transform using the filter bank structure of the discrete wavelet transform. Although this general method is already efficient, it is shown that noticeable computational savings can be obtained by applying known fast convolution techniques, such as the FFT (fast Fourier transform), in a suitable manner. The modified algorithms are termed 'fast' because of their ability to reduce the computational complexity per computed coefficient from L to log L (within a small constant factor) for large filter lengths L. For short filters, smaller gains are obtained: 'fast running FIR (finite impulse response) filtering' techniques allow one to achieve typically 30% savings in computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast algorithms for discrete and continuous wavelet transforms","doi":"10.1109/18.119724","startPage":"569","endPage":"586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119724.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Fast algorithms for discrete and continuous wavelet transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast algorithms for discrete and continuous wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00119724.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041354S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"408","articleId":"119724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":119725,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119725.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shiftable multiscale transforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Shiftable multiscale transforms","volume":"38","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119725/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shiftable multiscale transforms","sourcePdf":"00119725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045391S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"881","articleId":"119725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":119727,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Theorems that estimate local Lipschitz exponents of functions from the evolution across scales of their wavelet transform are reviewed. It is then proven that the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus detect the locations of irregular structures and provide numerical procedures to compute their Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations has a particular behavior that is studied separately. The local frequency of such oscillations is measured from the wavelet transform modulus maxima. It has been shown numerically that one- and two-dimensional signals can be reconstructed, with a good approximation, from the local maxima of their wavelet transform modulus. As an application, an algorithm is developed that removes white noises from signals by analyzing the evolution of the wavelet transform maxima across scales. In two dimensions, the wavelet transform maxima indicate the location of edges in images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119727.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Singularity detection and processing with wavelets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119727/","displayDocTitle":"Singularity detection and processing with wavelets","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196018","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Singularity detection and processing with wavelets","sourcePdf":"00119727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096809S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2655","articleId":"119727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":119728,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Transients are characterized by a signal model containing some unknown parameters, and by a 'model mismatch' representing the difference between the model and the actual signal. Both linear and nonlinear signal models are considered. The transients are assumed to undergo a noninvertible linear transformation prior to the application of the detection algorithm. Examples of such transforms include the short-time Fourier transform, the Gabor transform, and the wavelet transform. Closed-form expressions are derived for the worst-case detection performance for all possible mismatch signals of a given energy. These expressions make it possible to evaluate and compare the performance of various transient detection algorithms, for both single-channel and multichannel data. Numerical examples comparing the performance of detectors based on the wavelet transform and the short-time Fourier transform are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119729","startPage":"665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119729.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119729","endPage":"673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of transient detectors based on a class of linear data transforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of transient detectors based on a class of linear data transforms","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4196020","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of transient detectors based on a class of linear data transforms","sourcePdf":"00119729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028506S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"54","articleId":"119729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119730,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that, by an appropriate choice of analysis window and sampling intervals, it is possible to obtain a Fourier representation which can be computed efficiently and overcomes the limitations of using a fixed scale of window, yet by virtue of its symmetry properties allows simple estimation of such fundamental signal parameters as instantaneous frequency and onset time/position. The transform is applied to the segmentation of both image and audio signals, demonstrating its power to deal with signal events which are localized in either time/space or frequency. Feature extraction and segmentation are performed through the introduction of a class of multiresolution Markov models, whose parameters represent the signal events underlying the segmentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","startPage":"674","endPage":"690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized wavelet transform for Fourier analysis: the multiresolution Fourier transform and its application to image and audio signal analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A generalized wavelet transform for Fourier analysis: the multiresolution Fourier transform and its application to image and audio signal analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196021","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized wavelet transform for Fourier analysis: the multiresolution Fourier transform and its application to image and audio signal analysis","sourcePdf":"00119730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046305S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"62","articleId":"119730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119731,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

Measuring emergent signal frequencies requires spectral measurements accurate in both frequency and time or space, conflicting requirements that are shown to be balanced by a generalized uncertainty relationship. Such spectral measurements can be obtained from the responses of multiple wavelet-like channel filters that sample the signal spectrum, and that yield a locus of possible solutions for each locally emergent frequency. It is shown analytically that this locus of solutions is maximally localized in both space and frequency if the channel filters used are Gabor wavelets. A constrained solution is obtained by imposing a stabilizing term that develops naturally from the assumptions on the signal. The measurement of frequencies is then cast as an ill-posed extremum problem regularized by the stabilizing term, leading to an iterative constraint propagation algorithm. The technique is demonstrated by application to a variety of 2-D textured images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.119731","startPage":"691","endPage":"712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized measurement of emergent image frequencies by Gabor wavelets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119731/","displayDocTitle":"Localized measurement of emergent image frequencies by Gabor wavelets","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4196022","publicationDate":"March 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized measurement of emergent image frequencies by Gabor wavelets","sourcePdf":"00119731.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067974S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"126","articleId":"119731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":119732,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119732.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-based algorithms for best basis selection","doi":"10.1109/18.119732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-based algorithms for best basis selection","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196023","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-based algorithms for best basis selection","sourcePdf":"00119732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02086S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2110","articleId":"119732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":119733,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

This theory precisely relates (a) the rate of decay in the error between the original image and the compressed image as the size of the compressed image representation increases (i.e., as the amount of compression decreases) to (b) the smoothness of the image in certain smoothness classes called Besov spaces. Within this theory, the error incurred by the quantization of wavelet transform coefficients is explained. Several compression algorithms based on piecewise constant approximations are analyzed in some detail. It is shown that, if pictures can be characterized by their membership in the smoothness classes considered, then wavelet-based methods are near-optimal within a larger class of stable transform-based, nonlinear methods of image compression. Based on previous experimental research it is argued that in most instances the error incurred in image compression should be measured in the integral sense instead of the mean-square sense.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression through wavelet transform coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.119733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119733.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Image compression through wavelet transform coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196024","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression through wavelet transform coding","sourcePdf":"00119733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047374S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"516","articleId":"119733","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119734,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

The techniques are based on optimizing certain cost functions. The first technique consists of minimizing an upper bound that is derived on the L/sub 2/ norm of error in approximating the signal up to the desired scale. It is shown that a solution to the problem of minimizing that bound does exist and it is explained how the constrained minimization over the parameters that define discrete finite support orthogonal wavelets can be turned into an unconstrained one. The second technique is based on maximizing an approximation to the norm of the projection of the signal on the space spanned by translates and dilates of the analyzing discrete orthogonal wavelet up to the desired scale. Both techniques can be implemented much faster than the optimization of the L/sub 2/ norm of either the approximation to the given signal up to the desired scale or that of the error in that approximation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119734.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.119734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimal choice of a wavelet for signal representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal representations","Wavelet analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal analysis","Wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Image edge detection","Signal processing","Signal detection","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","signal processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal projection","optimisation","signal representation","discrete orthogonal wavelet","finite support signal","cost functions","L/sub 2/ norm of error","constrained minimization","translates","dilates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"On the optimal choice of a wavelet for signal representation","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196025","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimal choice of a wavelet for signal representation","sourcePdf":"00119734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07391S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"167","articleId":"119734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119735,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A natural framework for developing such a theory is the study of stochastic processes indexed by nodes on lattices or trees in which different depths in the tree or lattice correspond to different spatial scales in representing a signal or image. In particular, it is shown how the wavelet transform directly suggests such a modeling paradigm. This perspective then leads directly to the investigation of several classes of dynamic models and related notions of multiscale stationarity in which scale plays the role of a time-like variable. The investigation of models on homogeneous trees is emphasized. The framework examined here allows for consideration, in a very natural way, of the fusion of data from sensors with differing resolutions. Also, thanks to the fact that wavelet transforms do an excellent job of 'compressing' large classes of covariance kernels, it is seen that these modeling paradigms appear to have promise in a far broader context than one might expect.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","startPage":"766","endPage":"784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and estimation of multiresolution stochastic processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and estimation of multiresolution stochastic processes","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196026","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and estimation of multiresolution stochastic processes","sourcePdf":"00119735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"224","articleId":"119735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":119736,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

These signals, which are referred to as 'dy-homogeneous' signals because they generalize the well-known homogeneous functions, have highly convenient representations in terms of orthonormal wavelet bases. In particular, wavelet representations can be exploited to construct orthonormal self-similar bases for these signals. The spectral and fractal characteristics of dy-homogeneous signals make them appealing candidates for use in a number of applications. As one potential example, their use in a communications-based context is considered. Specifically, a strategy for embedding information into a dy-homogeneous waveform on multiple time-scales is developed. This multirate modulation strategy, called fractal modulation, is potentially well-suited for use with noisy channels of simultaneously unknown duration and bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","startPage":"785","endPage":"800","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet-based representations for a class of self-similar signals with application to fractal modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wavelet-based representations for a class of self-similar signals with application to fractal modulation","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet-based representations for a class of self-similar signals with application to fractal modulation","sourcePdf":"00119736.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033869S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"130","articleId":"119736","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":119737,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This method has several important properties, including the flexibility to be used at multiple resolution levels. The resolution level is defined in terms of the support of the polynomial B-splines used. An expression for the optimal rate of growth of the sieve is derived using a discrepancy measure derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence of parameterized density functions. While the sieves may be defined on nonuniform grids, in the case of uniform grids the optimal sieve size corresponds to an optimal resolution.

Algorithms are developed to assess the integrity of the acoustic spectrum at all processing stages. The algorithms employ wavelet representations, multiresolution processing, and the method of convex projections to construct a close replica of the input stimulus. Reconstructions using natural speech sounds demonstrate minimal loss of information along the auditory pathway. Close inspection of the final auditory patterns reveals spectral enhancements and noise suppression that have close perceptual correlates. The functional significance of the various auditory processing stages is discussed in light of the model, together with their potential applications in automatic speech recognition and low bit-rate data compression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auditory representations of acoustic signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.119739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119739.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Auditory representations of acoustic signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196030","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auditory representations of acoustic signals","sourcePdf":"00119739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071398S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"238","articleId":"119739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119740,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

In each case, the use of wavelets offers tangible benefits over the traditional Fourier-transform-based imaging. These stem from the simultaneous time and frequency localization properties of the wavelets. The first application utilizes the localization properties of wavelets to acquire single T/sub 2/ weighted images in times which are short relative to current methods. An interesting combinatorial scheduling problem arises from the multiscale structure inherent in the formulation of this procedure. Its solution is sketched and applied to the imaging process. The second example is a technique for potentially 'instant' imaging. Image acquisition is modeled as an inverse wavelet transform of the spin density in the region in question. Signal acquisition takes place in as few as one or two echoes after the excitation by RF pulses designed to excite a moving band of spins in a slice. These sweeping RF pulses excite strips of spins which rephase at different times during acquisition. They replace phase-encoding gradients; no fast pulsed gradients are required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two applications of wavelet transforms in magnetic resonance imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.119740","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/3425/00119740.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.119740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Two applications of wavelet transforms in magnetic resonance imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1992","accessionNumber":"4196031","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two applications of wavelet transforms in magnetic resonance imaging","sourcePdf":"00119740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053394S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"3425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"88","articleId":"119740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":119741,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

It is shown that prior information regarding the relative bandwidth and the time-bandwidth-product of the signal to be detected is efficiently incorporated into the detection problem formulation. Thus, the proposed detection scheme is most suitable for detection of unknown transient signals when prior information about the signal time-bandwidth product and relative bandwidth exists.

In different real coordinate systems, the components of X transform linearly, but the amplitudes of the components of Z transform nonlinearly. The author describes a method to reconstruct the relative phases of the (complex) components of Z (and, therefore, of X) based on the amplitude measurements of its n components in an orthogonal coordinate system and at least 2n-3 additional amplitude measurements in different directions. The author shows the necessary and sufficient condition on these additional directions to ensure uniqueness of the phase and polarization reconstruction for any arbitrary vector X, and presents an algebraic method for the reconstruction which offers substantial reduction in computing time over the method of reconstruction by nonlinear optimization. The result of this phase of reconstruction is the complete characterization of the polarization of X except for chirality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Phase measurement","Coordinate measuring machines","Vectors","Radiology","Optimization methods","Sufficient conditions","Reconstruction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase reconstruction","EM field measurement","EM wave polarization","relative phases","complex vector","amplitude measurements","real vector","orthogonal coordinate system","uniqueness","polarization reconstruction","computing time"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.119776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/3426/00119776.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=3426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.119776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algebraic method to reconstruct the relative phases and polarization of a complex vector in N dimensions based on 3(N-1) amplitude measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=119776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An algebraic method to reconstruct the relative phases and polarization of a complex vector in N dimensions based on 3(N-1) amplitude measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/119776/","volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4133849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algebraic method to reconstruct the relative phases and polarization of a complex vector in N dimensions based on 3(N-1) amplitude measurements","sourcePdf":"00119776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024986S","chronDate":"Dec 1991","isNumber":"3426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"2","articleId":"119776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":119777,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The relationship obtained extends the results reported in the literature and is useful in many frequency-domain estimation problems.
