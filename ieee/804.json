To solve this optimization problem with a nonconcave objective function and a complex-valued matrix variable, we extend the recently developed successive pseudo-convex approximation framework and propose a novel iterative algorithm that has the following advantages: 1) fast convergence as the structure of the original optimization problem is preserved as much as possible in the approximate problem solved in each iteration, 2) easy implementation as each approximate problem is natural for parallel computation and its solution has a closed-form expression, and 3) guaranteed convergence to a stationary point. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are also illustrated numerically in terms of energy efficiency gains from mobile network infrastructure perspective.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Fifth International Workshop on Cloud Technologies and Energy Efficiency in Mobile Communication Networks (CLEEN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8029866/8045902/08045913.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 Fifth International Workshop on Cloud Technologies and Energy Efficiency in Mobile Communication Networks (CLEEN)","doi":"10.23919/CLEEN.2017.8045913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CLEEN.2017.8045913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8045913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile network energy efficiency optimization in MIMO multi-cell systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","MIMO","Linear programming","Convergence","Iterative methods","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","concave programming","iterative methods","MIMO communication","mobile communication","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile network energy efficiency optimization","MIMO multicell systems","energy efficiency maximization problem","intercell interference","optimization problem","nonconcave objective function","complex valued matrix variable","pseudo-convex approximation framework","iterative algorithm","approximate problem","parallel computation","mobile network infrastructure perspective"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficiency","Interference-limited System","MIMO","Nonconvex Optimization","Pseudoconvex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8045913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 June 2017","displayDocTitle":"Mobile network energy efficiency optimization in MIMO multi-cell systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8045913/","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"17193237","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","conferenceDate":"22-22 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile network energy efficiency optimization in MIMO multi-cell systems","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056729S","chronDate":"22-22 June 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8029866","isNumber":"8045902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8029866","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8045902","articleId":"8045913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AEIT","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8045951,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Wu","id":"38542238400"},{"name":"Fen Zhou","affiliation":["CERI-LIA (Computer Science Laboratory), University of Avignon, Avignon, France"],"firstName":"Fen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37066142100"},{"name":"Qinghai Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"firstName":"Qinghai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37288952900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4977-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4978-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8045951","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Optimization","Wireless communication","Resource management","Stochastic processes","Media","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","optimisation","radio networks","resource allocation","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic network resource optimization","radio frequency networks","heterogeneous wireless network","VLC","stochastic media content arrival rates","dynamic wireless channel conditions","two-timescale stochastic network resource optimization problem","Lyapunov optimization technique","two-timescale adaptive network resource optimization framework","ANRO","network selections","resource allocations","radio frequency access point","visible light communication","user equipments"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource optimization scheme for a heterogeneous wireless network combining with a radio frequency (RF) access point (AP) and multiple visible light communication (VLC) APs. For adapting to the stochastic media content arrival rates and dynamic wireless channel conditions, a two-timescale stochastic network resource optimization problem is formulated by employing the Lyapunov optimization technique. To this end, we propose an online two-timescale adaptive network resource optimization (ANRO) framework. At the ANRO, the network selections for user equipments (UE) are operated at a large timescale, while the resource allocations for both RF and VLC APs are operated at a small timescale. Simulation results exhibit that the ANRO not only stabilizes the network but also significantly reduces the energy consumption than other existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/MoWNet.2017.8045951","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking (MoWNeT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Selected Topics in Mobile and Wireless Networking (MoWNeT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8032557/8045935/08045951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MoWNet.2017.8045951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8045935","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic network resource optimization in hybrid VLC and radio frequency networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8045951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic network resource optimization in hybrid VLC and radio frequency networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8045951/","conferenceDate":"17-19 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17206623","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8045951/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic network resource optimization in hybrid VLC and radio frequency networks","confLoc":"Avignon, France","sourcePdf":"p70wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079095S","chronDate":"17-19 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8032557","isNumber":"8045935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8032557","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8045935","articleId":"8045951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8045952,"authors":[{"name":"Zifan Li","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Networking and Switching Tech., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Zifan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086176505"},{"name":"David J.

In [2], we developed a probabilistic channel detecting jamming attacks that dramatically decreased the rendezvous success rates of EJS and developed the Random Enhanced Jump Stay (REJS) CH rendezvous algorithm that largely mitigated those jamming attack. Here we provide extensions of EJS and REJS and provide guidelines when they should be used. The focus in [2] was jamming mitigation but here we carefully analyze the performance of several new algorithms while still guaranteeing bounded MTTR and improved the ETTR over EJS. In fact, it appears EJS should seldom be used.

This paper is devoted to energy consumption modeling, battery lifetime analysis, lifetime-aware scheduling, and transmit power control for massive MTC over cellular networks. We consider a realistic energy consumption model for MTC and model network battery-lifetime. Analytic expressions are derived to demonstrate the impact of scheduling on both the individual and network battery lifetimes. The derived expressions are subsequently employed in the uplink scheduling and transmit power control for mixed-priority MTC traffic in order to maximize the network lifetime. Besides the main solutions, lowcomplexity solutions with limited feedback requirement are investigated, and the results are extended to existing LTE networks. In addition, the energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, and network lifetime tradeoffs in resource provisioning and scheduling for MTC over cellular networks are investigated. The simulation results show that the proposed solutions can provide substantial network lifetime improvement and network maintenance cost reduction in comparison with the existing scheduling

In this paper, a novel joint reconstruction framework for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is implemented and evaluated. The CT and MRI data sets are synchronously acquired and registered from a hybrid CT-MRI platform. Because the image data sets are highly undersampled, the conventional methods (e.g., analytic reconstructions) are unable to generate decent results. To overcome this drawback, we employ the compressed sensing (CS) sparse priors from an application of discrete gradient transform. On the other hand, to utilize multimodal imaging information, the concept of projection distance is introduced to penalize the large divergence between images from different modalities. During the optimization process, CT and MRI images are alternately updated using the latest information from current iteration. The method exploits the structural similarities between the CT and MRI images to achieve better reconstruction quality. The entire framework is accelerated via the parallel processing techniques implemented on a nVidia M5000M Graph Processing Unit. This results in a significant decrease of the computational time (from hours to minutes). The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a pair of undersampled projections CT and MRI body images. For comparison, the CT and MRI images are also reconstructed by an analytic method, and iterative methods with no exploration of structural similarity, known as independent reconstructions. Results show that the proposed joint reconstruction provides a better image quality than both analytic methods and independent reconstruction by revealing the main features of the true images. It is concluded that the structural similarities and correlations residing in images from different modalities are useful to mutually promote the quality of joint image reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08046006.pdf","startPage":"20099","endPage":"20110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754327","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/7859429/8046006-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse-Prior-Based Projection Distance Optimization Method for Joint CT-MRI Reconstruction","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046006/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17515800","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046006/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF CAREER Award CBET","grantNumber":"1540898"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sparse-Prior-Based Projection Distance Optimization Method for Joint CT-MRI Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"access-cui-2754327-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086057S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8046006","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8046007,"authors":[{"name":"Karan Gumber","affiliation":["IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/8186262/8046007/gumbe-2754422-small.gif","p":["Karan Gumber (S\u201915) received the M.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India, in 2012.

In this paper, a wideband hybrid RF/digital predistortion (HRF-DPD) linearization technique is reported to compensate for the nonlinearity of ultra-wideband power amplifier (PA) for 5G systems driven by carrier aggregated and wideband modulated signals. The proposed methodology is suitable for 5G PA design, since its power overhead and system bandwidth does not increase with an increase in signal bandwidth. Taking advantage of recent available digital signal processing solutions, the proposed method reduces hardware requirements of the conventional analog predistorter by alleviating the need of vector multiplier, branch line coupler, and delay lines. Such linear operations are controlled digitally, which provides flexibility in terms of digitally compensation of delay, gain and phase control of the signal. For establishing a proof of concept, HRF-DPD is implemented with ZX60V-82+ class AB PA and tested using a 100- and 50-MHz long term evolution-carrier aggregated (LTE-CA) signal at 2 GHz. Experimental results show that the wideband PA along with the proposed predistorter delivers an adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of -54 dBc with a cancellation of 30.6 dB for 100-MHz LTE-CA signal. With the proposed method PA, nonlinear distortion outside the 100-MHz band can be linearized leading to filter less architecture which provides 45-dBc ACLR performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046007/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17431677","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046007/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Hybrid RF Predistorter Linearizer for Ultra Wideband 5G Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Defence Research and Development Organization, India","grantNumber":"ERIP/ER/1400477/M/01"},{"fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board, India","grantNumber":"EMR/2016/001310"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Hybrid RF Predistorter Linearizer for Ultra Wideband 5G Systems","sourcePdf":"jetcas-gumber-2754422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088378S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"8186262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8186262","articleId":"8046007","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046010,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Lyu","affiliation":["Simulation Equipment Business Department, North Information Control Institute Group Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8046010/lyu-2754344-small.gif","p":["Ming Lyu was born in Taizhou, China, in 1980.

The resource allocation is designed through studying tightly coupled problems at two different levels. The upper-level problem aims at slicing the fronthaul capacity and cloud computing resources for all OPs to maximize the weighted profits of OPs and InP considering practical constraints on the fronthaul capacity and cloud computation resources. Moreover, the lower-level problems maximize individual OPs' sum rates by optimizing users' transmission rates and quantization bit allocation for the compressed I/Q baseband signals. We develop a two-stage algorithmic framework to address this two-level resource allocation design. In the first stage, we transform both upper-level and lowerlevel problems into corresponding problems by relaxing underlying discrete variables to the continuous ones. We show that these relaxed problems are convex and we develop fast algorithms to attain their optimal solutions. In the second stage, we propose two methods to round the optimal solution of the relaxed problems and achieve a final feasible solution for the original problem. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform two greedy resource allocation algorithms and their achieved sum rates are very close to sum rate upper-bound obtained by solving relaxed problems. Moreover, we study the impacts of different parameters on the system sum rate, performance tradeoffs, and illustrate insights on a potential system operating point and resource provisioning issues.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08046013.pdf","startPage":"18675","endPage":"18691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End-to-End Network Slicing in Virtualized OFDMA-Based Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046013/","displayDocTitle":"End-to-End Network Slicing in Virtualized OFDMA-Based Cloud Radio Access Networks","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266528","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046013/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"End-to-End Network Slicing in Virtualized OFDMA-Based Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"access-le-2754461-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127714S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8046013","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046017,"authors":[{"name":"Lingzhi Yi","affiliation":["School of Environmental Protection and Safety Engineering, University of South China, Hengyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8046017/yi-2754269-small.gif","p":["Lingzhi Yi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in the civil engineering from the University of South China, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Environmental Protection and Safety Engineering.

Due to the uneven random deployment, sensor energy depletion, and external attacks, the emergence of coverage holes would remarkably degrade the network performance and quality of service. For overcoming the drawbacks resulting from the coverage holes, this paper focuses on how to locally detect coverage holes by exploiting one-hop neighboring sensors' cooperation based on the novel confident information coverage model (CIC), which is formulated as the localized confident information coverage hole detection (LCICHD) problem. For handling the CICHD problem, we devise a family of heuristic CIC holes detection schemes including the LCHD, LCHDRL, random and randomRL. Both the LCHD and LCHDRL schemes locally determine coverage status of each subregion and take the sensor communication ability into consideration. While the LCHDRL considers not only the sensor remaining energy but also the residual lifetime during the CIC hole detection. After acquiring the coverage status of each partitioned local subregion, the coverage hole boundary will be extracted by image processing techniques. For comparison, both the Random and RandomRL schemes arbitrarily select sensors within the sensing field to detect CIC holes, and the RandomRL scheme takes the sensors' residual lifetime into consideration during the hole detection process. Experimental simulations show that the proposed schemes can efficiently detect the emerged coverage holes including the locations and the number, and the LCHDRL algorithm is more practical and efficient compared with the other three peer solutions.","topic":"Cyber-Physical-Social Computing and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication,

propose a chaos-based physically-enhanced secure scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based passive optical network (OFDM-PON). This scheme employs a pseudorandom number sequence generated by a chaotic logistic map to control the frequencies of RF subcarriers. Due to the characteristic of chaos, these chaotic frequencies of RF subcarriers are difficult to be decrypted by an eavesdropper, which could greatly enhance the security of OFDM-PON. An experiment with 10-Gb/s 16 QAM-OFDM data is successfully transmitted over 20-km fiber, and it has confirmed that the proposed security scheme can protect the system from an eavesdropper or attacker, while keep a good performance for legal optical network units.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7990618/08046020.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2754407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2754407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7990618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physically Secured Optical OFDM-PON by Employing Chaotic Pseudorandom RF Subcarriers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Radio frequency","Security","Passive optical networks","Optical transmitters","Chaotic communication","Physical layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","passive optical network","pseudorandom RF subcarriers."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Physically Secured Optical OFDM-PON by Employing Chaotic Pseudorandom RF Subcarriers","volume":"9","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8046020/","impactStatement":"Security is a key issue for optical access networks and physical layer security techniques is one of the promising solutions.

Spatial modulation (SM) and GSM are emerging low-complexity MIMO schemes that have been extensively researched for low-GHz (below 6GHz) communications. Recently, they have been considered and shown to be promising also for (mmWave) communications. In the simplest possible case, they require only one RF chain both at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), and thus, are especially attractive for mmWave communications, in which the number of RF chains needs to be as low as possible. Despite of some early works on the theoretical analysis of SM/GSM for mmWave communications, there have been no investigations using real-world channel data. We focus on the office line-of-sight (LOS) scenario and investigate three problems: 1) the performance of GSM using the extracted LOS component of measured channels; 2) the impact of non-LOS NLOS components on the performance of GSM; and 3) possible simple modulation and reception algorithms for GSM that rely only on the LOS component of the channel. The results being reported in this paper not only validate the main claims of previous studies based on ideal pure LOS channels, but also lead to novel findings. One major conclusion is that NLOS components are harmful to the SEP of GSM and should be avoided. As another important outcome, our results strongly motivate the use of precoding in GSM systems to simultaneously improve the channel capacity and reduce the physical size of MIMO arrays (thus eliminating one major issue of LOS GSM).","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08046024.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Generalized Spatial Modulation MIMO Over Measured 60GHz Indoor Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Generalized Spatial Modulation MIMO Over Measured 60GHz Indoor Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046024/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519925","htmlLink":"/document/8046024/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian COMET-K2 programme of the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM)"},{"fundingName":"Austrian federal government and the federal state of Upper Austria"},{"fundingName":"Czech Science Foundation Mobile channel analysis and modelling in millimeter wave band","grantNumber":"17-27068S"},{"fundingName":"SIX project","grantNumber":"CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0072"},{"fundingName":"operational program Research and Development for Innovation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission (EC) through the H2020-ETN-5G wireless research project","grantNumber":"641985"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (ANR) through the Spatial Modulation research project (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019Information et de la Communication\u2013Action Plan 2015)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Generalized Spatial Modulation MIMO Over Measured 60GHz Indoor Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2754280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108712S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8046024","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046025,"authors":[{"name":"Junshi Xia","affiliation":["Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8240806/8046025/xia-2744662-small.gif","p":["Junshi Xia (S\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. degree in geographic information systems and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from the China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in image processing from the Grenoble Images Speech Signals and Automatics Laboratory, Grenoble Institute of Technology, Grenoble, France, in 2014.","From 2014 to 2015, he was a Visiting Scientist with the Department of Geographic Information Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.

EPs, which are based on an extrema-oriented connected filtering technique, are applied to the images associated with the first informative components extracted by independent component analysis, leading to a set of EMEPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on two benchmark hyperspectral images: the University of Pavia and Indian Pines. Comparative experimental evaluations reveal the superior performance of the proposed methods, especially those employing rotation-based and boosted rotation-based approaches.

The transmitter and relay nodes are equipped with both fixed and EH batteries. The source for harvesting at the transmitter is the solar energy, and at the relay node, the interference energy in the radio frequency is the harvesting source. Time switching scheme is used at the relay to switch between EH and decoding information. Harvest-use approach is implemented, and we investigate the effects of the harvesting energy in enhancing the performance of the relaying system by deriving estimated closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of each link's individual SNR and of the end-to-end SNR. The analytical expression for the ergodic capacity is also derived. These expressions are validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. It is also shown that with the additional EH at the transmitter (source and relay), a significant improvement in the system throughput can be achieved when fixed batteries are running on low powers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08046030.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Relaying Systems With Fixed and Energy Harvesting Batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Relaying Systems With Fixed and Energy Harvesting Batteries","volume":"66","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046030/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699087","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046030/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N032268/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Relaying Systems With Fixed and Energy Harvesting Batteries","sourcePdf":"tcomm-musavian-2754278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155192S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8046030","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046032,"authors":[{"name":"Yongseok Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8087858/8046032/lim-2754326-small.gif","p":["Yongseok Lim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2017, respectively.","He was with the ASIC Lab, Central Research Institute, Samsung Electro-Mechanics Inc., Suwon, South Korea, from 2003 to 2005.

In general, one of the most efficient conditions for energy beamforming is that the magnetic fields induced by each antenna should be synthesized to head the same direction. To synthesize the magnetic fields induced at each antenna, interference by mutual inductance that can occur between transmitting (TX) antennas should be minimized. In addition, energy should not be exchanged between the TXs, otherwise it lowers the transmission efficiencies of TX and receiving antenna. In this paper, we present an optimal antenna structure that minimizes the mutual inductance between two TX antennas. First, we have analyzed the mutual inductance between TX antennas that have asymmetric sizes with different antenna lengths and arrangement angles. The directivity of the magnetic field vector is also investigated through an experimental analysis of an antenna structure. Finally, it has been verified that the optimal TX antennas for energy beamforming should be symmetric, which means that all the length of antennas are same and disposed perpendicular to each other. The experimental results show that the deviations of magnetic field directivity for symmetric and asymmetric antennas are 0.045 and 0.355, respectively, which shows that the symmetric structure shows 8.2 times larger consistency over the asymmetric structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17288724","htmlLink":"/document/8046032/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Antenna Structure for Energy Beamforming in Wireless Power Transfer","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP) through the National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2016R1A2B4015329"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIT) through IT Research and Development Program of IITP","grantNumber":"R-20160222-002757"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Antenna Structure for Energy Beamforming in Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tap-park-2754326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07073S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8087858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8087858","articleId":"8046032","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8046034,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Abdelmottaleb Omar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ahmed Abdelmottaleb","lastName":"Omar","orcid":"0000-0002-0397-0198","id":"37085654800"},{"name":"Zhongxiang Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhongxiang","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0003-0110-7179","id":"37273304700"},{"name":"Hao Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0002-1559-7028","id":"37086215319"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"8046034","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2590},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046034","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Absorption","Reflection","Resonant frequency","Frequency selective surfaces","Resonators","Ports (Computers)","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave transmission","frequency response","frequency selective surfaces","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary frequency response","absorptive frequency-selective reflection structure","absorptive frequency-selective transmission structure","transmission window","3D frequency-selective structure","absorption bandwidth","ultrawideband absorber","AFSR","AFST","reflection-transmission band","UWB absorber","frequency 1.8 GHz to 14.4 GHz","loss 1.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Absorptive frequency-selective surface (AFSS)","absorptive frequency-selective reflection/transmission structure (AFSR/AFST)","rasorber","ultrawideband (UWB) absorber"]}],"abstract":"Tailoring methodology is proposed in this communication to achieve an arbitrary frequency response within a wide absorption band.

Due to the profound physical insights provided by an NCM, a desired antenna performance can be achieved by properly manipulating the modes through reactive loading at specified ports. This paper presents a new matching technique for an N-port internally loaded small antenna. By combining the NCM with the differential evolution algorithm, optimal reactive load values can be calculated. These loads can manipulate the NCMs to match the antenna in a desired bandwidth. Unlike other matching techniques based on the NCM, the desired bandwidth is achieved through internal reactive loading without the need for an input matching network. Two examples of electrically small monopole antennas are studies. In both examples, we study the possibility to match the antennas in the GSM 900 band, and we further investigate the possibility to achieve wider bandwidths by varying the number of ports and the loading topologies based on the interpretation of the characteristic modes. The loaded antennas are wideband with a relatively stable radiation pattern and an efficiency higher than 90%. To confirm the theoretical results, a prototype is fabricated and measured.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loaded antennas","Bandwidth","Loading","Topology","Optimization","Admittance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","evolutionary computation","mobile antennas","monopole antennas","multiport networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NCM","internal reactive loading","input matching network","loading topologies","loaded antennas","optimized manipulation","network characteristic modes","N-port networks","differential evolution algorithm","optimal reactive load values","monopole antennas","GSM 900 band","N-port internally loaded small antenna","multiport antenna system","radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth enhancement","electrically small antennas","multiport antennas","network characteristic modes (NCMs)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2754408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8087858/08046035.pdf","startPage":"5757","endPage":"5767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8087858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2754408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Manipulation of the Network Characteristic Modes for Wideband Small Antenna Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Manipulation of the Network Characteristic Modes for Wideband Small Antenna Matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046035/","volume":"65","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046035/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17288692","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Union through the European Regional Development Fund"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Brittany and Rennes M\u00e9tropole, through the CPER Project SOPHIE/STIC & Ondes"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Manipulation of the Network Characteristic Modes for Wideband Small Antenna Matching","sourcePdf":"tap-jaafar-2754408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090545S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8087858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8087858","articleId":"8046035","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8046041,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanqing Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8314245/8046041/wu-2748971-small.gif","p":["Yuanqing Wu (S\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2016.

Simple configuration and excellent performance including an impedance bandwidth of 46.5%, stable gain of around 6 dBi, and symmetrical cardioid radiation patterns with low backward radiation and low cross polarizations are achieved. An SIW 90\u00b0 twist integrated in three-layered substrate is implemented in order to connect the ME-dipole antenna conveniently to the SIW beam-forming network with broad walls parallel to substrates. A 4 \u00d7 4 SIW Butler matrix with a three-layered zigzag topology is then designed, which enables a size reduction of 45% for the matrix compared with conventional single-layered configuration but not affecting its operating characteristics. By employing a 2 \u00d7 4 ME-dipole array with 90\u00b0 twists, two-folded Butler matrices and four SIW 3 dB E-plane couplers, a multibeam endfire array that can radiate eight beams scanning in two dimensions is designed at the 60 GHz band. The fabricated prototype verifies that a wide impedance bandwidth of 22.1%, gain varying from 10 to 13 dBi and stable radiation beams can be obtained. Due to good performance and the compact structure with low fabrication costs, the proposed design would be attractive for future millimeter-wave wireless applications including 5G communications and the WiGig system.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2754328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8087858/08046045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2754328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8087858","startPage":"5837","endPage":"5845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60 GHz Horizontally Polarized Magnetoelectric Dipole Antenna Array With 2-D Multibeam Endfire Radiation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60 GHz Horizontally Polarized Magnetoelectric Dipole Antenna Array With 2-D Multibeam Endfire Radiation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17288727","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046045/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671052"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331002"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China","grantNumber":"9042377 and CityU 11277116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60 GHz Horizontally Polarized Magnetoelectric Dipole Antenna Array With 2-D Multibeam Endfire Radiation","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2754328-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076805S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8087858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8087858","articleId":"8046045","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046047,"authors":[{"name":"Mihir Laghate","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA","University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mihir","lastName":"Laghate","orcid":"0000-0001-9852-9719","id":"37075150100"},{"name":"Paulo Urriza","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Santa Clara, CA, USA","University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Urriza","id":"37888078200"},{"name":"Danijela Cabric","affiliation":["University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Danijela","lastName":"Cabric","id":"37271490100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8046047","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046047","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Modulation","Reactive power","Sensors","Standards","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cognitive radio","frequency division multiple access","higher order statistics","OFDM modulation","signal classification","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel access method classification","cognitive radio applications","temporal holes","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","code division multiple access","fourth-order cumulant-based modulation classifier","collision detector","contention-based channel access methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic signal classification","channel access method","collision detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2754367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8293945/08046047.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2754367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Access Method Classification for Cognitive Radio Applications","abstract":"Motivated by improved detection and prediction of temporal holes, we propose a two stage algorithm to classify the channel access method used by a primary network.

A utility function of the tradeoff between EE and SE is defined first. Then, we formulate the tradeoff utility maximization problem as a joint channel allocation and power control problem for cellular and D2D users. The original problem is transformed into a more tractable subtractive form, and we further decompose the problem into several subproblems that can be solved separately. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and offer valuable insights. Compared with EE, SE is much less sensitive to the variation of the tradeoff factor, which indicates that our proposed scheme can achieve high EE while guaranteeing a fairly large value of SE with a properly chosen EE-SE tradeoff factor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046052/","volume":"66","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8046052/","accessionNumber":"17372547","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency and Spectrum Efficiency Tradeoff in the D2D-Enabled HetNet","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401041 and 61671072"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency and Spectrum Efficiency Tradeoff in the D2D-Enabled HetNet","sourcePdf":"tvt-lv-2754424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081907S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8046052","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8046053,"authors":[{"name":"Ilia Polian","affiliation":["Department of Hardware-Oriented Computer Science, Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Polian","orcid":"0000-0002-6563-2725","id":"37273423400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0663"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0671"}],"articleNumber":"8046053","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Integrated circuit reliability","Integrated circuit modeling","Measurement","Manufacturing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability challenges","approximate circuitry","approximate computing","next-generation computer architectures","physical realization","AC systems","hardware failures","AC paradigm","hardware blocks","AC components","AC blocks","test methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing (AC)","early life failures","emerging architectures","reliability","test"]}],"abstract":"As it becomes more and more evident that approximate computing (AC) is a key enabler for next-generation computer architectures, physical realization of AC systems is gaining in relevance.

We also discuss the intricate interplay of approximate circuitry with failures that manifest themselves during the device's life-time.","doi":"10.1109/LES.2017.2754446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563995/8303002/08046053.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2017.2754446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8303002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test and Reliability Challenges for Approximate Circuitry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Test and Reliability Challenges for Approximate Circuitry","volume":"10","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17599834","htmlLink":"/document/8046053/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test and Reliability Challenges for Approximate Circuitry","sourcePdf":"les-polian-2754446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044632S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4563995","isNumber":"8303002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563995","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8303002","articleId":"8046053","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046057,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Ding","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/8046057/ding-2754416-small.gif","p":["Ming Ding (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.S. and M.S.\n degrees (with first class Hons.) in electronics engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai,\n China, and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in signal and information processing from SJTU, in 2004, 2007, and\n 2011, respectively.

Such new results were captured in IEEE ComSoc Technology News with an alarming title of \u201cWill Densification Be the Death of 5G?\u201d In this paper, we revisit this issue from more practical views of realistic network deployment, such as a finite number of active base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs), a decreasing BS transmission power with the network densification, etc. Particularly, in dense SCNs, due to an oversupply of BSs with respect to UEs, a large number of BSs can be put into idle modes without signal transmission, if there is no active UE within their coverage areas. Setting those BSs into idle modes mitigates unnecessary intercell interference and reduces energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the performance impact of such BS idle mode capability (IMC) on dense SCNs. Different from existing work, we consider a realistic path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS transmissions. Moreover, we obtain analytical results for the coverage probability, the area spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency (EE) performance for SCNs with the BS IMC and show that the performance impact of the IMC on dense SCNs is significant. As the BS density surpasses the UE density in dense SCNs, the coverage probability will continuously increase toward one, addressing previous concerns on \u201cthe death of 5G\u201d. Finally, the performance improvement in terms of the EE performance is also investigated for dense SCNs using practical energy models developed in the Green-Touch project.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2754416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/08046057.pdf","startPage":"10446","endPage":"10460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2754416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Impact of Idle Mode Capability on Dense Small Cell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046057/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Impact of Idle Mode Capability on Dense Small Cell Networks","volume":"66","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372548","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046057/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Impact of Idle Mode Capability on Dense Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ding-2754416-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108418S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8046057","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046066,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Xu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8124133/8046066/xu-2754445-small.gif","p":["Hang Xu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009 and 2013, respectively.

However, the multimode decoupling technology remains a great challenge, especially for mobile terminals. One difficulty in achieving multidecoupling modes is that the operating modes of closely packed decoupling elements have very strong mutual effect, which makes the tuning complicated and even unfeasible. Thus, in physical principle, a novel idea of achieving the stability of the boundary conditions of decoupling elements is proposed to solve the mutual effect problem; in physical structure, a metal boundary is adopted to realize the stability. One distinguished feature of the proposed technique is that the independent tuning characteristic can be maintained even if the number of decoupling elements increases. Therefore, wideband/multiband high isolation can be achieved by using multidecoupling elements. To validate the concept, two case studies are given. In a quad-mode decoupling design, the isolation is enhanced from 12.7 to >21 dB within 22% bandwidth by using a 0.295\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.059\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.007\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n decoupling structure.

We provide an explanation of this observation based on potential function analysis.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2754262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08046069.pdf","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2754262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clipping Can Improve the Performance of Spatially Coupled Sparse Superposition Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Clipping Can Improve the Performance of Spatially Coupled Sparse Superposition Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046069/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17414969","htmlLink":"/document/8046069/","volume":"21","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001839","fundingName":"University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"AoE/E-02/08, CityU 11217515 and CityU 11280216"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clipping Can Improve the Performance of Spatially Coupled Sparse Superposition Codes","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ma-2754262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8046069","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046070,"authors":[{"name":"J.-Y.

presents an improved pulse-width-modulation-based sliding-mode (SM) controller for the regulation of a 2-stage dc-dc cascade boost converter. The main drawback of the existing SM controller is that its use in the regulation of the high-order dc-dc converter results in a trade-off between the overshoot and speed of the transient output response. In order to overcome this problem, the sliding surface of the proposed SM controller is designed such that the integral action in the resulting equivalent control signal is based on the normalized output voltage error of the converter. Also, the derivative of the integrand is bounded by a user defined constant. The derivation of equivalent control signal of the proposed SM controller and the stability analysis of the closed-loop system are presented. Finally, an experimental comparative study involving the proposed and existing SM controllers is provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","volume":"65","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"18194558","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8046074/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Improved PWM-Based Sliding-Mode Controller for a DC\u2013DC Cascade Boost Converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved PWM-Based Sliding-Mode Controller for a DC\u2013DC Cascade Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chincholkar-2754292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101045S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8513902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8513902","articleId":"8046074","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046078,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8087858/8046078/cheng-2754423-small.gif","p":["Yu Jian Cheng (SM\u201914) was born in Sichuan, China, in 1983.

This multilayer topology has a smaller size compared with the single-layer design. A simple and feasible method is applied to control the radiation pattern, which is able to realize dual-CP low SLL beams without a complicated feeding network. Two 1-D sixteen-way unequal dividers are employed to suppress the SLL in two planes of a CP array. Then, a 90\u00b0 coupler is employed in the feeding network to switch the polarization modes between left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP).

First, it is shown that zero forcing (ZF) is essential as a transmission scheme in massive MIMO systems, whereas the maximum-ratio combining method cannot reduce interference effectively in such systems. In addition, it is shown that analog-digital hybrid beamforming can be used to reduce the calculation complexity and improve hardware implementation. Next, we compared the Shannon capacity with the achievable bit rate (ABR), using ZF for seven-user MIMO transmissions with 100 elements at the BS. When the number of degrees of freedom in the array antenna is guaranteed, the ABR is almost the same as the Shannon capacity. Moreover, multiuser transmission is realized by linear decoding. Thus, decoding methods such as ZF are effective in massive MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8124133/08046082.pdf","startPage":"6703","endPage":"6711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2754441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2754441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Massive MIMO Considering Real Propagation Characteristics in the 20-GHz Band","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Analog-digital conversion","Interference","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","decoding","diversity reception","interference suppression","microwave propagation","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","seven user equipment units","maximum-ratio combining method","seven-user MIMO transmissions","real propagation characteristics","multiple input multiple output measurements","base station","zero forcing","ZF","interference reduction","analog-digital hybrid beamforming","achievable bit rate","ABR","antenna array","multiuser transmission","linear decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog\u2013digital hybrid beamforming","eigenvalues","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Shannon capacity","zero forcing (ZF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Massive MIMO Considering Real Propagation Characteristics in the 20-GHz Band","volume":"65","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8046082/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394492","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KAKENHI, a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"17H03262"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Massive MIMO Considering Real Propagation Characteristics in the 20-GHz Band","sourcePdf":"tap-nishimori-2754441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074181S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8124133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8124133","articleId":"8046082","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046083,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Ming Chen","affiliation":["ESAT-TELEMIC Research Division, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8124133/8046083/chen-2754444-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Ming Chen (S\u201916) received the M.S. degree from the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2006.

Various studies analyze the impact of the number of antennas, relying on channel properties only and assuming uniform antenna gains in very large arrays. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mutual coupling and edge effects on the gain pattern variation in the array. Our analysis focuses on the comparison of patch antennas versus dipoles, representative for the antennas typically used in massive MIMO experiments today. Through simulations and measurements, we show that the finite patch array has a lower gain pattern variation compared with a dipole array. The impact of a large gain pattern variation on the massive MIMO system is that not all antennas contribute equally for all users, and the effective number of antennas seen for a single user is reduced. We show that the effect of this at system level is a decreased rate for all users for the zero-forcing MIMO detector, up to 20% for the patch array and 35% for the dipole array. The maximum ratio combining on the other hand, introduces user unfairness.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2754444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8124133/08046083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2754444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124133","startPage":"6712","endPage":"6720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Large Antenna Arrays for Massive MIMO: Characterization and System Impact","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite Large Antenna Arrays for Massive MIMO: Characterization and System Impact","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394478","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) through MAMMOET","grantNumber":"619086"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Hercules Foundation","grantNumber":"AKUL1318"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Large Antenna Arrays for Massive MIMO: Characterization and System Impact","sourcePdf":"tap-chen-2754444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074794S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8124133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8124133","articleId":"8046083","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8046084,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8454009/8046084/wang-2754246-small.gif","p":["Peng Wang received the bachelor's degree in electrical\n engineering and automation, and a PhD in control science and engineering from Beihang University (China) in 2004 and\n 2011, respectively.

The set of such questions that require no external information to answer is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce FVQA (Fact-based VQA), a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA primarily contains questions that require external information to answer. We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which contains image-question-answer triplets, through additional image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. Each supporting-fact is represented as a structural triplet, such as <;Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees>. We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel model which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of supporting-facts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18062637","pubMedId":"28945588","htmlLink":"/document/8046084/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2018","volume":"40","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FVQA: Fact-Based Visual Question Answering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ARC Future Fellowship","grantNumber":"FT120100969"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FVQA: Fact-Based Visual Question Answering","sourcePdf":"tpami-shen-2754246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181945S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8454009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8454009","articleId":"8046084","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046093,"authors":[{"name":"Miryung Kim","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/8532001/8046093/kim-2754374-small.gif","p":["Miryung Kim received the BS degree in computer science from Korea\n Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, in 2001 and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science and engineering\n from the University of Washington under the supervision of Dr. David Notkin, in 2003 and 2008 respectively.

This leads to relatively high steady-state ripples and requires fast sampling rate. Additionally, enumeration-based optimal vector selection is computationally intensive. Recently, double-vector-based schemes have been proposed to improve the steady-state performance of FCS-MPC. However, they are usually complicated in vector selection and duty ratio calculation. In this paper, a universal multiple-vector-based MPC (UMV-MPC) is proposed, which achieves the same performance as the state-of-the-art double-vector-based MPC, but executes in a much more efficient and universal way. Unlike conventional FCS-MPC, enumerating process and state predictions for candidate voltage vectors are not required in the proposed UMV-MPC to select the best voltage vectors. In UMV-MPC, the optimal vectors and duty ratios are directly constructed from deadbeat control (DBC) based on space vector modulation (SVM), which is easy to follow and quick to use. The proposed UMV-MPC is not only more efficient than prior methods, but also reveals the inherent relationship between double-vector-based MPC and DBC with SVM. A comparative study of UMV-MPC and prior double-vector-based MPC is carried out in this paper. The theoretical analysis as well as simulation and experimental tests on a 2.2-kW induction motor drive are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed UMV-MPC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Universal Multiple-Vector-Based Model Predictive Control of Induction Motor Drives","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2754324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8350354/08046107.pdf","startPage":"6957","endPage":"6969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2754324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Universal Multiple-Vector-Based Model Predictive Control of Induction Motor Drives","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8046107/","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17737009","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"3162012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Universal Multiple-Vector-Based Model Predictive Control of Induction Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2754324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107859S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8350354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"8350354","articleId":"8046107","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046108,"authors":[{"name":"Yuqian Gao","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqian","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085847060"},{"name":"Zhaohao Wang","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaohao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-2999-7903","id":"37085376060"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Lin","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086011690"},{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Kang","id":"38238916200"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086214193"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Research Institute, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0001-8088-0404","id":"37536930400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-125X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0085"}],"articleNumber":"8046108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":495},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046108","abstract":"Spin-hall-assisted spin transfer torque (SHA-STT) can achieve high-speed, magnetic-field-free, and high-reliable magnetization switching in a three-terminal device consisting of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) above a heavy-metal. Nowadays, the development of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy drives the continuous scaling of the MTJ. In addition, an asymmetric exchange interaction called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) inevitably exists at the heavy metal/ferromagnet interface and has a considerable influence on the magnetization dynamics. Considering these factors, in this work, we study the scaling performance of the SHA-STT driven magnetization dynamics in the presence of DMI. Simulation results demonstrate that, for nonzero DMI, the magnetization switching is activated by domain nucleation, whose mechanism is strongly dependent on the MTJ size and DMI magnitude. The critical SHE current density for magnetization switching decreases with the enlarged MTJ or enhanced DMI. In the presence of DMI, the switching time decreases with the scaling of the MTJ. Moreover, compared with the case of zero DMI, the switching speed is improved or deteriorated for the weak or strong DMI, respectively. Our work demonstrates that the MTJ size and DMI magnitude should be optimized in order to achieve a good tradeoff among a set of performance metrics of the SHA-STT devices.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2017.2754406","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8101104/08046108.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2017.2754406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8101104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling Study of Spin-Hall-Assisted Spin Transfer Torque Driven Magnetization Switching in the Presence of Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya Interaction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetization","Current density","Magnetic tunneling","Thermal stability","Energy barrier","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current density","exchange interactions (electron)","magnetic domain walls","magnetic multilayers","magnetic switching","magnetic tunnelling","magnetisation","magnetoelectronics","micromagnetics","MRAM devices","nucleation","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","spin Hall effect","spin polarised transport"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction","magnetic tunnel junctions","perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","continuous scaling","asymmetric exchange interaction","heavy metal/ferromagnet interface","SHA-STT driven magnetization dynamics","nonzero DMI","MTJ size","zero DMI","weak DMI","strong DMI","SHA-STT devices","spin-hall-assisted spin transfer torque","magnetization switching","domain nucleation","DMI magnitude","critical SHE current density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spin-Hall-assisted spin transfer torque","Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interaction","spin orbit torque","magnetic domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scaling Study of Spin-Hall-Assisted Spin Transfer Torque Driven Magnetization Switching in the Presence of Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya Interaction","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17806956","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046108/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61704005, 61501013, 51602013 and 61571023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling Study of Spin-Hall-Assisted Spin Transfer Torque Driven Magnetization Switching in the Presence of Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya Interaction","sourcePdf":"tnano-zhao-2754406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130919S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8101104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8101104","articleId":"8046108","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046110,"authors":[{"name":"Ekta Purwar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, Varanasi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8046110/purwa-2754399-small.gif","p":["Ekta Purwar (S\u201916) received the M.Tech. degree in power system engineering from the National Institute of Technology Patna, Patna, India, in 2014.

A distribution system with distributed generators (DGs) is a multi-source system, in which DGs can be connected or disconnected to meet the high or low load requirements respectively. Also, during fault conditions, DGs can get disconnected due to their low fault ride-through capabilities. These changes in connections change the number of DGs and the operational status of the system, which in turn change the fault currents seen by relays and the ranges of maximum and minimum fault currents for which the relays settings work coordinately. This paper realizes that an increase in the proliferation of DGs makes the relay coordination problem a highly constrained optimization problem, and changes in the number of DGs make the problem more complex, which can decelerate the overall performance of relays. The aim of this paper is to reduce the complexity and design a fast, robust, and adaptive protection scheme which can efficiently work in the variable environment of the DG-distribution system. This paper proposes a novel constraints reduction-based relay coordination method which selects a small set of constraints out of large set of constraints while determining the optimal relays settings. The relay coordination problem is formulated as a linear programming problem. The performance of the proposed method is tested on the both configurations, radial and meshed, of the IEEE 38-bus distribution system. Comparative studies have been conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach under changing system's configuration with variable locations and sizes of DGs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Constraints Reduction-Based Optimal Relay Coordination Method Considering Variable Operational Status of Distribution System With DGs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2754399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08046110.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2754399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Constraints Reduction-Based Optimal Relay Coordination Method Considering Variable Operational Status of Distribution System With DGs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8046110/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18365290","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Constraints Reduction-Based Optimal Relay Coordination Method Considering Variable Operational Status of Distribution System With DGs","sourcePdf":"tsg-purwar-2754399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078354S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8046110","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046115,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Martchovsky","affiliation":["Analog Devices Company, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8270698/8046115/martc-2731660-small.gif","p":["Andrey Martchovsky received the B.S. degree in applied physics and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, in 2009 and 2016, respectively.","From 2008 to 2012, he was with Multigig Inc., as an Analog Design Engineer, where he was involved in the design of coupled oscillators and fractional-N frequency synthesizers.

This allows the use of spatial degrees of freedom, not available in typical L-C oscillator topologies, in the design of the amplifier needed to sustain the oscillating mode. Here, we present a novel amplifier design that takes advantage of this extra degree of freedom to improve performance of RTWOs in two ways. If no precautions are taken then the oscillation can start in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. The Phased amplifier, introduced here, forces one direction of oscillation with a measured probability of reverse oscillation of less than 0.43 ppm with a confidence level of 99%.

This is accomplished by adding additional phase-dependent degeneration transistors and phase shifting the various amplifier inputs by taking them from different locations on the transmission line. Additionally, this amplifier design reduces the phase noise by reducing the amplifier noise during the time that the oscillator is most sensitive to phase perturbation, resulting in a 1.2-dB reduction in phase noise measured 1 MHz from the peak and a 2.9-dB improvement in the figure of merit.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2731660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2731660","startPage":"522","endPage":"530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8270698/08046115.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8270698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplifier Innovations for Improvement of Rotary Traveling Wave Oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Amplifier Innovations for Improvement of Rotary Traveling Wave Oscillators","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17524516","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8046115/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006410","fundingName":"Analog Devices Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplifier Innovations for Improvement of Rotary Traveling Wave Oscillators","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pedrotti-2731660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06093S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8270698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8270698","articleId":"8046115","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046135,"authors":[{"name":"Vineeth Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8046135/kumar-2752154-small.gif","p":["Vineeth Kumar (S\u201916) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering from Amrita University, Amritapuri, Kerala, in 2011, and the M.Tech. degree in signal processing from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, in 2014.

They depend upon reduced feedback schemes to efficiently feedback channel state information from the users to the base station (BS). In the popular threshold-based quantized feedback scheme, a user feeds back to the BS the quantized value of the signal-to-noise ratio for each subchannel. For this scheme, we derive a novel, throughput-optimal discrete rate adaptation (TORA) policy, which enables a system designer to reduce the feedback overhead. We present it in closed form for different multi-antenna diversity modes for the exponentially correlated subchannel gains model. We also develop a computationally simpler suboptimal variant of it. We derive an insightful lower bound for the fadingand user location-averaged throughput gain achieved by TORA over conventional rate adaptation for 1-bit feedback. We present extensive results to benchmark the system-level performance of TORA for different numbers of feedback bits and modulation and coding schemes available at the BS, and various schedulers, quantizers, and multi-antenna modes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2752154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8103134/08046135.pdf","startPage":"7634","endPage":"7645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2752154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base Station-Side Rate Estimation for Threshold-Based Feedback, and Design Implications in Multi-User OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046135/","displayDocTitle":"Base Station-Side Rate Estimation for Threshold-Based Feedback, and Design Implications in Multi-User OFDM Systems","volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372699","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046135/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST-Swaranajayanti Fellowship Award","grantNumber":"DST/SJF/ETA-01/2014-15"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Communications & Information Technology, India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station-Side Rate Estimation for Threshold-Based Feedback, and Design Implications in Multi-User OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-kumar-2752154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118862S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8046135","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046136,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Woo Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8169696/8046136/kim-2739127-small.gif","p":["Seong-Woo Kim (M\u201911) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Seoul National University in 2011.

College campuses have unique mobility requirements in terms of layout, population, and demand and patterns. It is typically recommended to minimize the presence of private automobiles on campuses due to teaching and research disturbances, visual degradation from parking provision, environmental pollution, and negative health effects. As an alternative to private automobiles, shared mobility systems have been considered for both campus and urban transportation. Conventional shuttle systems suffer from the first and last mile problem. A bicycle and pedestrian friendly policy is not a generalizable solution for all geographic locations and campus layouts. We suggest a driverless taxi service as an alternative point-to-point shared mobility system for campuses. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this service on a 4.5-km campus road at Seoul National University. The service has covered over 10 000 km autonomously since the first public demonstration was made in November 2015.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2739127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8169696/08046136.pdf","startPage":"3513","endPage":"3526","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2739127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Campus Mobility Services Using Driverless Taxi","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Campus Mobility Services Using Driverless Taxi","volume":"18","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8046136/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446598","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004085","fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2010-0001958"},{"fundingName":"Institute of New Media and Communication"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Campus Mobility Services Using Driverless Taxi","sourcePdf":"tits-kim-2739127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095308S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8169696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8169696","articleId":"8046136","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8046137,"authors":[{"name":"Longzhuang He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8046137/he-2752707-small.gif","p":["Longzhuang He (S\u201915) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

However, due to the lack of precoding design, the preceding GenSM-aided mm-wave MIMO schemes suffered from severe performance loss. Inspired by the reduced-RF-chain structure making implementation cost low while maintaining the benefit of GenSM, in this paper, we incorporate the technique of hybrid precoding into GenSM-aided mm-wave MIMO, where a hybrid digital and analog precoding regime is proposed to enhance the system's achievable rate. Moreover, a closed-form expression is proposed to provide an accurate approximation to the spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by the proposed scheme. The proposed expression is further simplified in the region of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By exploiting the proposed SE expressions as low-complexity cost functions, two algorithms, i.e. the gradient ascent algorithm and the high-SNR approximation algorithm, are exploited to optimize the hybrid precoders in terms of SE maximization. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to substantiate the superior SE performance achieved by the proposed scheme over other GenSM-aided mm-wave MIMO schemes as well as the state-of-the-art mm-wave MIMO systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17372700","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046137/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Generalized Spatial Modulation Aided Millimeter Wave MIMO: Spectral Efficiency Analysis and Hybrid Precoder Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471221 and 61471219"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Generalized Spatial Modulation Aided Millimeter Wave MIMO: Spectral Efficiency Analysis and Hybrid Precoder Design","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2752707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.238655S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8046137","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046145,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Aminjavaheri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8103134/8046145/aminj-2752153-small.gif","p":["Amir Aminjavaheri received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree from the Wireless Communication Laboratory, ECE Department, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

We consider the uplink transmission, while our results are applicable to the downlink as well. The absence of CP increases the spectral efficiency in expense of intersymbol interference and intercarrier interference. It is known that in massive MIMO, the effects of uncorrelated noise and multiuser interference vanish as the number of base station antennas tends to infinity. To investigate if the channel distortions in the absence of CP fade away, we study the performance of the standard maximum ratio combining receiver. Our analysis reveals that in this receiver, there always remains some residual interference leading to saturation of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. To resolve this problem, we propose using the time reversal (TR) technique. Moreover, in order to further reduce the multiuser interference, we propose a zero-forcing equalization to be deployed after the TR combining. We compare the achievable rate of the proposed system with that of the conventional CP-OFDM. We show that in realistic channels, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved by removing the CP from OFDM, while reducing the computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2752153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8103134/08046145.pdf","startPage":"7619","endPage":"7633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2752153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Without CP in Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046145/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Without CP in Massive MIMO","volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372701","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046145/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Without CP in Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"twc-aminjavaheri-2752153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095334S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8046145","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046150,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Guo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8577049/8046150/guo-2749337-small.gif","p":["Hongyan Guo received the Ph.D. degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2010.","She joined Jilin University in 2011, where she has been an Associate Professor with the Department of Control Science and Engineering, since 2014.

To obtain active chassis lateral stability for intelligent vehicles, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method integrating active front steering and an additional yaw moment is proposed. It adopts the tire sideslip angle to express vehicle lateral stability, and addresses the actuator and security constraints and the nonlinear properties of the tire-road force effectively. Moreover, the hardware implementation, based on the field programmable gate array (FPGA), is presented to satisfy miniaturization and to discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed NMPC method. To verify the effectiveness of the presented NMPC method, offline simulations comparing the NMPC method with the direct yaw moment control (DYC) method under various running conditions and a real-time implementation experiment are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed NMPC method controls better than the DYC-based method. In addition, the presented NMPC method exhibits good robustness when the longitudinal velocity and tire-road friction coefficient vary within a suitable range. Moreover, the computational time of the proposed NMPC controller, implemented using the FPGA, is only 4.994 ms during one sampling period, which can satisfy the real-time requirement of active chassis lateral stability control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Lateral Stability Control of Active Chassis for Intelligent Vehicles and Its FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2749337","startPage":"2","endPage":"13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2749337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8577049/08046150.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Lateral Stability Control of Active Chassis for Intelligent Vehicles and Its FPGA Implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8046150/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18325520","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403158 and 61573165"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010211","fundingName":"Education Department of Jilin Province","grantNumber":"2016-429"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Lateral Stability Control of Active Chassis for Intelligent Vehicles and Its FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"tsmc-guo-2749337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085384S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8577049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8577049","articleId":"8046150","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8046152,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Kumar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/8046152/kumar-2748984-small.gif","p":["Sachin Kumar received the B.Eng.

Existing algorithms for magnitude comparison in RNS are based either on parity check or partial reverse conversion. With separately designed RNS sign detectors, they can also be used to compare residue representations of signed integers.

The signs of the operands in comparison, as well as their difference are detected after scaling by a factor of (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2n</sup>\n -1)(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n-1</sup>\n -1).

The new approach resolves the previously reported high SNR stalling problem of MCMC without the need for hybridization with another detector method or adding heuristic temperature scaling factors. Another common problem with MCMC algorithms is the unknown convergence time making predictable fixed-length implementations problematic. When an insufficient number of iterations are used on a slowly converging example, the output log likelihood ratios can be unstable and overconfident. Therefore, we develop a method to identify rare slowly converging runs and mitigate their degrading effects on the soft-output information. This improves forward-error-correcting code performance and removes a symptomatic error floor in bit error rate plots. Next, pseudo-convergence is identified with a novel way to visualize the internal behavior of the Gibbs sampler. An effective and efficient pseudo-convergence detection and escape strategy is suggested. Finally, the new excited MCMC (X-MCMC) detector is shown to have near maximuma-posteriori performance even with challenging, realistic, and highly-correlated channels at the maximum MIMO sizes and modulation rates supported by the 802.11ac WiFi specification, 8 \u00d7 8 MIMO 256 quadrature amplitude modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08046155.pdf","startPage":"7718","endPage":"7732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2750667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2750667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Near MAP Performance With an Excited Markov Chain Monte Carlo MIMO Detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Wireless communication","Wireless fidelity","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error statistics","forward error correction","Markov processes","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAP performance","excited Markov chain Monte Carlo MIMO detector","MCMC algorithms","unknown convergence time","soft-output information","forward-error-correcting code performance","symptomatic error floor","bit error rate plots","excited MCMC detector","multiple-input multiple-output detector","SNR stalling problem","predictable fixed-length implementations","output log likelihood ratios","Gibbs sampler","pseudoconvergence detection","X-MCMC detector","maximum a-posteriori performance","802.11ac WiFi specification","MIMO 256 quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)","X-MCMC","pseudo-convergence","stalling","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detector","wireless communication"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8170465/8046155-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Near MAP Performance With an Excited Markov Chain Monte Carlo MIMO Detector","volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8046155/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415084","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1449033 and 1632569"},{"fundingName":"collaboration with Farhang Wireless Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Achieving Near MAP Performance With an Excited Markov Chain Monte Carlo MIMO Detector","sourcePdf":"twc-hedstrom-2750667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09187S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8046155","onlineDate":"19 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8046167,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed code can correct single bit errors, adjacent two-bit errors, adjacent 3-bit errors and nearly adjacent 2-bit errors and may be useful for error correction in registers or register arrays, in combinational circuits and also in memories for which data-multiplexing is not used.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new 3-bit burst-error correcting code","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046167","startPage":"3","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046167.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A new 3-bit burst-error correcting code","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046167/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206480","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new 3-bit burst-error correcting code","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP002012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040549S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8046169,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Andjelkovic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Andjelkovic","id":"37085890185"},{"name":"Milos Krstic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Krstic","id":"37266672400"},{"name":"Rolf Kraemer","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Kraemer","id":"38558438600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046169","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Robustness","System analysis and design","Fitting","Inverters","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high energy ionizing particle","current pulse shape","extensive circuit","amplitude-duration curves","amplitude-duration criterion assessment","SET-SEU robustness evaluation","critical charge concept","integrated circuits","device simulations","circuit simulations","load gates","supply voltage","inverters","bulk CMOS technology","SPICE simulations","single event upset","single event transient","size 130.0 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude-duration criterion","critical charge","SET and SEU robustness","circuit simulations"]}],"abstract":"The relation between amplitude and duration of the current pulse induced by a high energy ionizing particle has been proposed as a criterion for evaluating the SET and SEU robustness of integrated circuits. This criterion has advantage over the widely accepted critical charge concept in the sense that it is less dependent on the current pulse shape. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known report on the impact of design and operating parameters on the amplitude-duration criterion. The need for extensive circuit or device simulations to derive the amplitude-duration curves under varying design and operating parameters makes this approach very time-consuming. In that regard, this work proposes a method to establish the amplitude-duration criterion, with a limited number of circuit simulations, as a rational function in terms of the sizing factors of target and load gates and supply voltage. Initial evaluation on a simple circuit composed of two inverters, designed in 130 nm bulk CMOS technology, has shown that the proposed method provides the accuracy comparable to SPICE simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046169","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046169.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of the amplitude-duration criterion for SET/SEU robustness evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of the amplitude-duration criterion for SET/SEU robustness evaluation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046169/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206455","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046169/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of the amplitude-duration criterion for SET/SEU robustness evaluation","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP004014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045038S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8046197,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Tovletoglou","affiliation":["EEECS, Queen's University Belfast"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Tovletoglou","id":"37086152319"},{"name":"Dimitrios S.

The refresh rate in modern DRAMs is set based on the worst-case retention time without considering access statistics, thereby resulting in very frequent refresh operations. Such high refresh rate leads eventually to large power and performance overheads, which are increasing with higher DRAM densities. However, such high refresh rates may not even required due to extremely low probability of the actual occurrence of the assumed worst-case scenarios, or due to the implicit refresh operation that occur during every memory access, a feature that has not been yet been studied in depth. In this paper, we enhance the state-of-the-art by systematically exploiting the implicit refresh of memory access for relaxing the refresh rate, while minimizing the resulting memory errors. This is achieved by modifying the algorithmic parameters that influence the access patterns such that all stored data are being touched within a target time interval that is necessary for meeting a target error rate. The proposed method is applied to stencil-based algorithms which represent a wide class of algorithms used in numerical analysis, image processing and cellular automata applications. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on an off-the-shelf server running a fully fledged Linux OS and results show that it is even possible to completely disable DRAM refresh with minor quality loss.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046197","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046197.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relaxing DRAM refresh rate through access pattern scheduling: A case study on stencil-based algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Relaxing DRAM refresh rate through access pattern scheduling: A case study on stencil-based algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046197/","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17206491","htmlLink":"/document/8046197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxing DRAM refresh rate through access pattern scheduling: A case study on stencil-based algorithms","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP012031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054353S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046200,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ye","id":"37394807500"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085999473"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046200","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Robustness","System analysis and design","Manganese","Table lookup","DH-HEMTs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VPUF","multiple basic arbiter","voter based physical unclonable function","hardware security","weighted voter","FPGA","internal response bit","reliability level","on-line reliability checker","response bits","XOR arbiter PUF","typical PUF","modeling attack resistance","high reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function","Reliability","Modeling Attack Resistance","Reliability Checker","Weighted Voter"]}],"abstract":"Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) has broad application prospects in the field of hardware security. Arbiter PUF is a typical PUF, but is threatened by modeling attacks. To resist attack, XOR arbiter PUF employs multiple basic arbiter PUFs and XOR their response bits to generate the final response bit. However, its low reliability not only limits its applications, but also leaks information to enhance modeling attacks. To improve both the reliability and the modeling attack resistance, we propose the Voter based PUF (VPUF), which also employs multiple basic arbiter PUFs. It has two key components: (1) an on-line reliability checker to evaluate the reliability level of each internal response bit produced by each basic arbiter PUF; (2) a weighted voter, instead of XOR gates, to produce the final response bit. Experiments in FPGAs show 7.6%~23.4% reliability improvement of the VPUF than the XOR arbiter PUF, and prove the VPUF can resist modeling attacks.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046200","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046200.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VPUF: Voter based physical unclonable function with high reliability and modeling attack resistance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046200/","displayDocTitle":"VPUF: Voter based physical unclonable function with high reliability and modeling attack resistance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206471","htmlLink":"/document/8046200/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VPUF: Voter based physical unclonable function with high reliability and modeling attack resistance","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP015041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056036S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046202,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular, for aerospace and avionics application fields, SRAM-based FPGAs are increasingly adopted for their configurability features making them a viable solution for long-time applications. However, these fields are characterized by a radiation environment that makes the technology extremely sensitive to radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in the SRAM-based FPGA's configuration memory. Configuration scrubbing and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) have been widely adopted in order to cope with SEU effects. However, modern FPGA devices are characterized by a heterogeneous routing resource distribution and a complex configuration memory mapping causing an increasing sensitivity to Cross Domain Errors affecting the TMR structure. In this paper we developed a new methodology to calculate the reliability of TMR architecture considering the intrinsic characteristics of the new generation of SRAM-based FPGAs. The method includes the analysis of the configuration bit sharing phenomena and of the routing long lines. We experimentally evaluate the method of various benchmark circuits evaluating the Mean Upset To Failure (MUTF).

However, it has been demonstrated that sophisticated active attack techniques, such as laser voltage probing, can still bypass the bitstream protections during the configuration phase. On the other hand, although the security monitoring IP cores provided by FPGA vendors can ensure the physical security during the runtime of applications, they are unable to detect such attacks during configuration. In this work, we propose a novel approach to using PUFs as physical sensors to monitor the integrity of FPGAs against active attacks. Small modifications in existing PUF architectures enable us to design a PUF-based security scheme, which can be deployed for integrity monitoring and authentication/key generation at the same time. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against a range of powerful attacks, such as optical probing and fault attacks. We further discuss how this scheme can be deployed during bitstream configuration in FPGAs with partial reconfiguration capability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PUFMon: Security monitoring of FPGAs using physically unclonable functions","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046216","startPage":"186","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046216.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"PUFMon: Security monitoring of FPGAs using physically unclonable functions","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046216/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206462","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PUFMon: Security monitoring of FPGAs using physically unclonable functions","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP031093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098941S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046220,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ye","id":"37394807500"},{"name":"Yue Gong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086011279"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085999473"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046220","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Robustness","System analysis and design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CPU-FPGA SoC reconfigurability","physical unclonable function","polymorphic PUF","modeling attack","dynamic reconfigurability","challenge response pair correlation","CRP correlation","asymmetric RO pair"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Function","Modeling Attack","CPU+FPGA SoC","Reconfigurability","Asymmetric Ring Oscillator Pairs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046220","abstract":"Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is severely threatened by modeling attacks.

Modern logic locking techniques offer significant security advantages, like high corruptibility of the locked circuit's outputs when applying random keys (= 50% Hamming Distance-HD-compared to the correct outputs), or resilience to the key-sensitization attack. However, there are no techniques to combine both advantages. To solve this problem, weighted logic locking is proposed in this paper. Instead of the conventional single key-input control, the proposed technique uses multiple key-inputs to control every key-gate. This new, weighted key-gate control is by construction immune to the key-sensitization attack, while by employing a new key-gate insertion metric, 50% HD is obtained even for circuits with many outputs. Additionally, weighted key-gate control increases dramatically the probability of any key-gate to corrupt the circuit's values, which means that fewer key-gates are needed to achieve 50% HD. This way, execution time for locking the circuits is drastically reduced. Apart from these advantages, weighted logic locking is fairly \u201cgeneric\u201d and can be combined with other techniques to improve security (e.g., to thwart the SAT attack).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046226/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17206442","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Weighted logic locking: A new approach for IC piracy protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted logic locking: A new approach for IC piracy protection","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP041112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060994S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8046227,"authors":[{"name":"Kento Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Communications Engineering, Waseda University"],"firstName":"Kento","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37085905930"},{"name":"Masao Yanagisawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Communications Engineering, Waseda University"],"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Yanagisawa","id":"37278761600"},{"name":"Nozomu Togawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Communications Engineering, Waseda University"],"firstName":"Nozomu","lastName":"Togawa","id":"37267415800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046227","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1325},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Feature extraction","Integrated circuits","Hardware","Multi-layer neural network","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","integrated circuit design","invasive software","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural chips","outsourcing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer neural networks","IC design step","gate-level netlists","hardware Trojans classification","outsourcing","IC manufacturing","malicious third-party IC vendors","machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection method","Trojan-net feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware Trojan","gate-level netlist","machine learning","neural network","multi-layer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046227","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046227.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojans classification for gate-level netlists using multi-layer neural networks","abstract":"Recently, due to the increase of outsourcing in IC design and manufacturing, it has been reported that malicious third-party IC vendors often insert hardware Trojans into their products.

Prior work provides health monitoring via detection of degradation. Since many wearout mechanisms provide no degradation signal, this paper proposes to use the embedded SRAM as a dynamic monitor of system health. The SRAM is monitored by detecting error correcting code (ECC) failures. The cause of ECC failures is diagnosed electrically with on-chip built-in self test (BIST). The time stamps and diagnosis data are combined to estimate process-level wearout model parameters. The extracted wearout model parameters are combined with system wearout simulation data and the memory bit failures recovered by error correcting codes (ECC) to estimate the remaining lifetime of the entire processor. The estimation of the remaining life is helpful in monitoring potential chip failures in the near future, to ensure safe operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206478","htmlLink":"/document/8046230/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On-line monitoring of system health using on-chip SRAMs as a wearout sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line monitoring of system health using on-chip SRAMs as a wearout sensor","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP045123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058475S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8046234,"authors":[{"name":"Ulrich Backhausen","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Backhausen","id":"38304170500"},{"name":"Oscar Ballan","affiliation":["XILINX, US"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Ballan","id":"37447685200"},{"name":"Paolo Bemardi","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Piemonte, IT"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Bemardi","id":"37991550100"},{"name":"Sergio De Luca","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics I"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"De Luca","id":"37085516329"},{"name":"Julie Henzler","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Henzler","id":"37088356521"},{"name":"Thomas Kern","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kern","id":"37603079700"},{"name":"Davide Piumatti","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino I"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Piumatti","id":"37085895489"},{"name":"Thomas Rabenalt","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Rabenalt","id":"37689204700"},{"name":"Krishnapriya Chakiat Ramamoorthy","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Krishnapriya Chakiat","lastName":"Ramamoorthy","id":"37088356342"},{"name":"Ernesto Sanchez","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino I"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37277847800"},{"name":"Alessandro Sansonetti","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics I"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Sansonetti","id":"37085517521"},{"name":"Rudolf Ullmann","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Ullmann","id":"38247643800"},{"name":"Federico Venini","affiliation":["XILINX US","Politecnico di Torino I"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Venini","id":"37086099283"},{"name":"Robert Wiesner","affiliation":["INFINEON (IFX) DE"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wiesner","id":"37088355339"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046234","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046234","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Robustness","Software","Circuit faults","Automotive engineering","Error correction codes","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","software libraries","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","industrial overview","semiconductor manufacturer","Xilinx contribution","software test libraries","in-field testing","interconnect blocks","large SoC","Infineon section","on-line flash memory repair","STMicroelectronics","core self-test libraries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ISO 26262","Functional Safety","SoC On-Line Self-Test","Memory Repair","Security"]}],"abstract":"Different perspectives about the concept of Robustness in Automotive Electronic are provides by leading edge semiconductor manufacturer.

With every new generation, the proportion of electronics-controlled systems in the vehicles is steadily growing. In parallel the safety and reliability requirements to automobiles are becoming more stringent thus requiring more sophisticated approaches. The problem is complicated by the fact that automotive has started to use cutting-edge technologies whose maturity might not be always at high level. Thus, there is a need to ensure not only low DPPM during production mode but also high reliability during mission mode. This paper presents an advanced Error Correcting Codes (ECC) solution which ensures high level of single-bit and multi-bit error detection and correction for memories operating in mission mode. This solution addresses the main requirements posed by automotive industry as well as successfully passed ISO 26262 certification with ASIL-D grade.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046237.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046237","startPage":"71","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced ECC solution for automotive SoCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046237/","displayDocTitle":"Advanced ECC solution for automotive SoCs","htmlLink":"/document/8046237/","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17206459","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced ECC solution for automotive SoCs","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP052s13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051679S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8046238,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Rubio","affiliation":["Departament Enginyeria Electr\u00f3nica UPC, BarcelonaTech"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rubio","id":"37331955500"},{"name":"Manel Escudero","affiliation":["Departament Enginyeria Electr\u00f3nica UPC, BarcelonaTech"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Escudero","id":"37086154440"},{"name":"Peyman Pouyan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Lab Delft University"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Pouyan","id":"37892319400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046238","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Aging","Switches","Robustness","Switching circuits","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","low-power electronics","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive switching random access memories","RRAM ternary memories","reliability issues","variability mechanism","aging mechanism","CMOS compatibility","nonvolatile behavior","low power consumption","multivalued logic","cycle-to-cycle variability","1T1R cells"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM devices","ternary memories","variability","endurance","aging","adaptive mechanisms"]}],"abstract":"Resistive switching Random Access Memories (RRAM) are being considered as a promising alternative for conventional memories mainly due to their high speed, scalability, CMOS compatibility, Non-Volatile behavior (NVM), and consequent orientation to low power consumption.

Resilience to errors in sensing and control algorithm execution in processors all the way down to circuits for sensing and actuation is of critical importance in safety-critical applications where undetected errors can have disastrous consequences. In this presentation, we describe how ideas in the domain of algorithm-based fault tolerance developed in the mid-80s for signal processing and matrix computations can be applied to a vast domain of circuits and systems in electrical engineering; from digital and analog filters to complex nonlinear autonomous control systems. The key insight is that electrical systems can be fundamentally represented by linear and nonlinear differential equations with equivalent matrix representations. These representations can be encoded with extra check states that bear a known relationship with all the observable states of the system independent of the system driving inputs. By checking for the validity of this relationship, errors can be detected and mitigated in real-time with near-zero latency with minimal hardware overhead. The broad vision of the proposed methodology is illustrated with examples from different electrical engineering domains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046241/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17206440","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of efficient error resilience in signal processing and control systems: From algorithms to circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of efficient error resilience in signal processing and control systems: From algorithms to circuits","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP056s41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097234S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8046244,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Sch\u00f6ll","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sch\u00f6ll","id":"38541323900"},{"name":"Claus Braun","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Braun","id":"37532374200"},{"name":"Hans-Joachim Wunderlich","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans-Joachim","lastName":"Wunderlich","id":"37295737000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0352-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0351-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0353-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"8046244","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046244","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Resilience","Approximate computing","Runtime","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","conjugate gradient methods","fault tolerance","fault tolerant computing","iterative methods","mathematics computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly efficient fault tolerance technique","induced error","intermediate computational results","error-resilient iterative solvers","Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method","PCG","compute-intensive domains including science","engineering","error resilience","iterations","induced approximation errors","energy demand","novel adaptive method","iterative Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solvers","Approximate Computing hardware","high energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate Computing","Energy-efficiency","Fault Tolerance","Quality Monitoring"]}],"abstract":"Iterative solvers like the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method are widely-used in compute-intensive domains including science and engineering that often impose tight accuracy demands on computational results. At the same time, the error resilience of such solvers may change in the course of the iterations, which requires careful adaption of the induced approximation errors to reduce the energy demand while avoiding unacceptable results. A novel adaptive method is presented that enables iterative Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solvers on Approximate Computing hardware with high energy efficiency while still providing correct results. The method controls the underlying precision at runtime using a highly efficient fault tolerance technique that monitors the induced error and the quality of intermediate computational results.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046244","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on On-Line Testing and Robust System Design (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030509/8046164/08046244.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient and error-resilient iterative solvers for approximate computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient and error-resilient iterative solvers for approximate computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206452","htmlLink":"/document/8046244/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient and error-resilient iterative solvers for approximate computing","confLoc":"Thessaloniki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP059s52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057621S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030509","isNumber":"8046164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030509","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046164","articleId":"8046244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046304,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086094418"},{"name":"Chenchen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chenchen","lastName":"Fu","id":"37071989400"},{"name":"Yajuan Du","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yajuan","lastName":"Du","id":"37086021497"},{"name":"Aosong Deng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Aosong","lastName":"Deng","id":"37086094866"},{"name":"Mengying Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Mengying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38466615000"},{"name":"Liang Shi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shi","id":"38019681300"},{"name":"Chun Jason Xue","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, ShanDong University, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Chun Jason","lastName":"Xue","id":"37265504000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1898-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2977-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"8046304","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046304","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Performance evaluation","Androids","Humanoid robots","Kernel","Google","YouTube"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["F2FS","mobile devices","flash friendly file system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["F2FS","Fragmentation","Readahead","Hot/Cold Data Separation","Background GC"]}],"abstract":"Flash Friendly File System (F2FS) is getting popular among mobile devices.

It has been shown that reducing inter-vehicle separations to less than one car length results in the most benefits for the whole platoon; however, this poses a number of challenges. In particular, it becomes difficult to guarantee a collision-free braking in an emergency situation considering that individual vehicles may have different braking capacities in real-life settings - due to, for example, different load conditions, etc. Although control-theoretic approaches can be used to design a platoon's cruise operation, emergency braking leads to saturation, i.e., the maximum possible braking force is applied so as to stop the platoon in the shortest possible time and needs to be designed separately. In this paper, we address this issue and introduce a cyber-physical approach that guarantees a collision-free braking in emergency situations. The proposed approach exploits space buffers contained in between vehicles and can be configured to reduce stopping distance and platoon length, while maximizing aerodynamic benefits. We evaluate our approach based on realistic simulations with vehicle dynamics models typically used in the automotive industry for hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing. The effects of communication loss during platoon operation are also considered and fail-safe mechanisms are proposed and investigated.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046308","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031503/8046294/08046308.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046294","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting space buffers for emergency braking in highly efficient platoons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting space buffers for emergency braking in highly efficient platoons","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046308/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206509","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting space buffers for emergency braking in highly efficient platoons","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075568S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031503","isNumber":"8046294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031503","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8046294","articleId":"8046308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":8046324,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Wei Tsao","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Wei","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37071562400"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tei-Wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37085730830"},{"name":"Shau-Yin Tseng","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shau-Yin","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37086051568"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1898-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2977-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"8046324","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":265},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Memory management","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Nonvolatile memory","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","flash memories","integrated circuit design","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light-weight data separation design","NVDIMM main memory","big data era","data-intensive applications","hybrid memory module","small-sized high-speed DRAM","large-sized low-cost nonvolatile memory","flash memory","limited data separation overhead","data access reduction"]}],"abstract":"In the big data era, data-intensive applications have growing demand for the capacity of DRAM main memory, but the frequent DRAM refresh, high leakage power, and high unit cost bring serious design issues on scaling up DRAM capacity. To address this issue, NVDIMM, which is a hybrid memory module, becomes a possible alternative to replace DRAM as main memory in some data-intensive applications. NVDIMM that consists of a small-sized high-speed DRAM and a large-sized low-cost non-volatile memory (i.e., flash memory) has the serious performance issue on accessing data stored in the flash memory because of the huge performance gap between DRAM and flash memory. However, there is no or limited room to adopt a complex caching algorithm for using DRAM as the cache of flash memory in NVDIMM main memory because a complex caching algorithm itself would already cause too much performance degradation on handling each request to NVDIMM main memory. In this paper, we present a light-weight data separation design to boost NVDIMM performance with limited data separation overhead for reducing the data accesses to flash memory. A series of experiments was conducted based on popular benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed design can effectively improve the performance of NVDIMM main memory.","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046324","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031503/8046294/08046324.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distillation: A light-weight data separation design to boost performance of NVDIMM main memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distillation: A light-weight data separation design to boost performance of NVDIMM main memory","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046324/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206506","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046324/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distillation: A light-weight data separation design to boost performance of NVDIMM main memory","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"I21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076578S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031503","isNumber":"8046294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031503","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046294","articleId":"8046324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8046327,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086078179"},{"name":"Mengying Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Mengying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38466615000"},{"name":"Lei Ju","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Ju","id":"37544824100"},{"name":"Chun Jason Xue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chun Jason","lastName":"Xue","id":"37265504000"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085417542"},{"name":"Zhiping Jia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Zhiping","lastName":"Jia","id":"37306413900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1898-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2977-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"8046327","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Random access memory","Program processors","Registers","System performance","Computer architecture","Energy harvesting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-powered nonvolatile processors","Internet of Things devices","NVP","nonvolatile memory","multiple level cell NVM","MLC NVM","three-stage energy-aware cache management strategy"]}],"abstract":"Wearable, implantable and Internet of Things devices are attracting increasing attention from both research and industry.

Non-volatile memory (NVM) is typically attached for cache and main memory backup. There are researches working on optimization of the backup, however, little of them involve multiple level cell (MLC) NVM. In this work, we first discuss the benefit of applying MLC NVM for cache backup, and then propose a three-stage energy-aware cache management strategy to improve the system performance and energy utilization while guaranteeing successful backups. Evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve 16.7% energy reduction with comparative performance with the single level cell (SLC) based hybrid cache.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-aware morphable cache management for self-powered non-volatile processors","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046327","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046294","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031503/8046294/08046327.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware morphable cache management for self-powered non-volatile processors","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046327/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206528","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware morphable cache management for self-powered non-volatile processors","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"I24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127636S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031503","isNumber":"8046294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031503","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8046294","articleId":"8046327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046333,"authors":[{"name":"Dinuni Fernando","affiliation":["State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"Dinuni","lastName":"Fernando","id":"38547519900"},{"name":"Kyoung-Don Kang","affiliation":["State University of New York, Binghamton"],"firstName":"Kyoung-Don","lastName":"Kang","id":"37279668600"},{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["Rackspace, Inc."],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37532952200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1898-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2977-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"8046333","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time factors","Database systems","Adaptation models","Delays","Adaptive control","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","database management systems","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive closed-loop method","timely data services","data-intensive soft real-time applications","e-commerce","traffic control","target tracking","database system","database semantics","response time controller","target set-point","dynamic workloads","database model","adaptive control scheme","real-time database performance management","performance evaluation","steep workload surges"]}],"abstract":"In data-intensive soft real-time applications, e.g., e-commerce, traffic control, and target tracking, a database system needs to process transactions in a timely manner. However, user transactions may suffer from unpredictable large delays when the database system is overloaded due to flash transaction arrivals and transaction aborts/restarts. To address the problem, we design a new adaptive closed-loop method considering database semantics to control the response time to be below a target set-point even when dynamic workloads are given. Our approach continues to update the database model at runtime and re-tunes the response time controller based on the adjusted model, because the relation between the workload and response time may vary in time. Notably, our adaptive control scheme is different from most existing closed-loop methods for real-time database performance management that model the database system and design and tune the controller entirely offline with no online adaptation. The results of the performance evaluation undertaken in a real-time database testbed show that our approach maintains the database response time below the target set-point for most of the time even under steep workload surges, quickly canceling any transient delay overshoot that exceeds the set-point.

However, previous library based design flow faces several unresolved challenges. Firstly, they may result in large waste area between the modules due to the difference in module sizes. While utilizing multiple ratio modules can help to reduce the waste area, pre-synthesis each module for different ratios is time consuming and would require a large library. Secondly, when the targeting FPGA architecture changes, a new library is needed to best fit the targeting architecture. Re-synthesizing the library for different architectures is not feasible. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a dynamic module partitioning approach for the library based design flow to dynamically generate the appropriate shape of modules based on single-ratio modules in the library while efficiently utilizing the pre-placement module information. A set of rules are developed to select the most suitable module and determine the partition to minimize the area and delay of the placement without increasing much of the synthesis time. The proposed approach can adapt to different architectures and also address the fixed-outline constraint. Experiment results show that our approach can reduce the area by up to 10% with reasonably increased delay under acceptable runtime.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Shape","Partitioning algorithms","Computer architecture","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["library based placement","heterogeneous FPGA architecture","dynamic module partitioning approach","pre-placement module information","IP reuse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","B\u2217-tree","Placement","Dynamic Partition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046336","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046336","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031503/8046294/08046336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046336/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic module partitioning for library based placement on heterogeneous FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17206523","htmlLink":"/document/8046336/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic module partitioning for library based placement on heterogeneous FPGAs","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074531S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031503","isNumber":"8046294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031503","xplore-issue":"8046294","articleId":"8046336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046337,"authors":[{"name":"Shiming Li","affiliation":["Data sharing can speed up the collection of new training data from multi-devices"],"firstName":"Shiming","lastName":"Li","id":"37086099785"},{"name":"Duo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, china"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402813400"},{"name":"Chaoneng Xiang","affiliation":["Data sharing can speed up the collection of new training data from multi-devices"],"firstName":"Chaoneng","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37086094775"},{"name":"Jianfeng Liu","affiliation":["Data sharing can speed up the collection of new training data from multi-devices"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086097135"},{"name":"Yingjian Ling","affiliation":["Data sharing can speed up the collection of new training data from multi-devices"],"firstName":"Yingjian","lastName":"Ling","id":"37086100775"},{"name":"Tianjun Liao","affiliation":["Chongqing University, Chongqing, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Tianjun","lastName":"Liao"},{"name":"Liang Liang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086047445"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1898-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1897-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2977-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"8046337","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Mobile handsets","Data communication","Neural networks","Training","Computational modeling","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile handsets","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FitCNN","cloud-assisted lightweight convolutional neural network framework","mobile devices","deep neural network","cloud-assisted lightweight CNN framework","incremental learning","low data transmission","data transmission reduction"]}],"abstract":"Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have essentially reached the state-of-the-art accuracies in image classification and recognition. CNNs are usually deployed in server side or cloud to handle tasks collected from mobile devices, such as smartphones, wearable devices, unmanned systems and so on. However, significant data transmission overhead and privacy issues have made it necessary to use CNNs directly in device side. Nevertheless, the statically trained model deployed on mobile devices cannot effectively handle the unknown data and objects in new environments, which could lead to low accuracy and unsatisfied user experience. Hence, it would be crucial to retrain a better model via future unknown data. However, with tremendous computing cost and memory usage, training a CNN on mobile devices with limited hardware resources is intolerable in practical. To solve this issue, by using the power of cloud is a promising solution to assist mobile devices to train a deep neural network. Therefore, this paper proposes a cloud-assisted lightweight CNN framework, named FitCNN, with incremental learning and low data transmission, to deploy CNNs on mobile devices and make them smarter. To reduce the data transmission during incremental learning, we propose a strategy to selectively upload the data with high learning value, and develop an extracting strategy to choose light weights of the new CNN model trained on the cloud to update the old one on devices. Experimental results show that the selectively uploading strategy can reduce 39.4% uploading transmission based on a certain dataset, and the extracting weights strategy reduces by more than 60% updating transmission with multiple CNNs and datasets.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031503/8046294/08046337.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FitCNN: A cloud-assisted lightweight convolutional neural network framework for mobile devices","doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"FitCNN: A cloud-assisted lightweight convolutional neural network framework for mobile devices","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206514","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046337/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FitCNN: A cloud-assisted lightweight convolutional neural network framework for mobile devices","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091572S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031503","isNumber":"8046294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031503","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8046294","articleId":"8046337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046352,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Glein","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Glein","id":"38468878400"},{"name":"Philipp Mengs","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Mengs","id":"37086156175"},{"name":"Florian Rittner","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Rittner","id":"37074796100"},{"name":"Rainer Wansch","affiliation":["RF and Satellite Communications Department, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Wansch","id":"37303022100"},{"name":"Albert Heuberger","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Heuberger","id":"37294233800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046352","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BRAM implementation of a single-event upset sensor for adaptive single-event effect mitigation in reconfigurable FPGAs","abstract":"In this paper, we study the performance of a Block RAM (BRAM)-based embedded radiation sensor for adaptive single-event effect mitigation in FPGAs.

Temporary faults such as single-event upsets, which can be mitigated by well-known methods, are not as critical as permanent faults, since they may endanger the application in case of a defective FPGA. To overcome the impact of permanent faults, we introduce hardware fault detection, isolation, and recovery. In this paper we focus on the first step, the fault detection, performed by an automated test procedure. We separate the procedure in three subtasks: The source file generation, the build process, and the test process itself. With such a modular concept each subtask can be replaced by customized solutions. Each subtask runs autonomous and may be integrated into the automated test procedure. Moreover, our generic design strategy aims to achieve FPGA type and vendor independence, whereby we address SRAM-based FPGAs. We conduct a case study for a Xilinx Artix-7 to evaluate our implementation. In this first verification step, we only consider look-up tables as essential FPGA primitives. We achieve a fault coverage of approx. 96 % with only four bit files and an overall test process time of less than 20 s. The complete test procedure is based on tool command language scripting. Our frame-based fault injection confirms the successful detection of permanent faults within the covered region. Furthermore, we verify the procedure also for a Virtex-5QV.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046354","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046354.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated test procedure to detect permanent faults inside SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Automated test procedure to detect permanent faults inside SRAM-based FPGAs","htmlLink":"/document/8046354/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17193263","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated test procedure to detect permanent faults inside SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"17AHS2017paper9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064917S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046356,"authors":[{"name":"Dimple Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Dimple","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086055408"},{"name":"Lev Kirischian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Lev","lastName":"Kirischian","id":"37266985100"},{"name":"Valeri Kirischian","affiliation":["MDA Space Missions, Brampton, Canada"],"firstName":"Valeri","lastName":"Kirischian","id":"38093398500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046356","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Power demand","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Transient analysis","Space exploration","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Zynq XC7Z020 SoC","Arm Cortex A9 processor","worst-case overhead","power budget depletion","system configuration","decision-making adaptation method","task variants","design space","resource constraints","performance values","noncritical tasks","power consumption","resource utilization","clock frequencies","permanent faults","transient faults","hardware resources","space-borne FPGA-based systems","power budget variations","hardware faults","run-time adaptation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space-borne FPGA-based systems","reconfigurable computing","structural adaptation","power budget","fault-tolerance"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a method for FPGA-based space-borne systems supporting multi-task applications to enable run-time combined adaptation to variations in system power budget and variations in available hardware resources due to occurrence of transient or permanent faults. The adaptation method assumes that each task in the workload has multiple implementations, which can operate at different clock frequencies, have different resource utilization and hence different power consumption. Also, while the critical tasks have strict performance specifications, the non-critical tasks can execute in a range of performance values. Depending on the existing power consumption and resource constraints, the method explores the design space of the task variants at run-time to find a suitable combination of implementation variants of all the tasks such that performance of the critical tasks is sustained, and performance of non-critical tasks is adjusted in order to satisfy a reduced power budget and/or create spare resources to enable relocation of affected task components in the case of hardware faults. The paper presents a detailed analysis of how the decision-making adaptation method selects a system configuration in the different scenarios of power budget depletion and occurrence of faults. It also analyzes the the worst-case overhead of the mechanism when implemented on the Arm Cortex A9 processor in the Zynq XC7Z020 SoC.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046356","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046356.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-time adaptation method for mitigation of hardware faults and power budget variations in space-borne FPGA-based systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046356/","displayDocTitle":"Run-time adaptation method for mitigation of hardware faults and power budget variations in space-borne FPGA-based systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8046356/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206075","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-time adaptation method for mitigation of hardware faults and power budget variations in space-borne FPGA-based systems","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"19AHS2017paper26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083808S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046357,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics - CEI, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Arturo","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37086021466"},{"name":"Leonardo Suriano","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics - CEI, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Suriano","id":"37086023046"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Otero","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics - CEI, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9s","lastName":"Otero","id":"37585852100"},{"name":"Eduardo de la Torre","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics - CEI, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"de la Torre","id":"37355566400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046357","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Process control","Timing","Image processing","Pipelines","Visualization","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","autonomous aerial vehicles","control engineering computing","fault diagnosis","operating systems (computers)","path planning","real-time systems","robot vision","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic reconfiguration mechanism","RTEMS","fault mitigation","functional adaptation","SRAM-based SoPC","space systems","scrubbing strategy","FPGA-based heterogeneous system-on-chip","reconfigurable processor","space applications","device configuration memory","device logic","real time operating system","embedded processor","reconfiguration memory","periodic timing deadlines","reconfigurable image processing pipeline","autonomous visual navigation systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration","Space Systems","Fault tolerance","Real Time Operating Systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046357","abstract":"This paper describes the integration of a scrubbing strategy and a dynamic reconfiguration mechanism within an FPGA-based heterogeneous System-on-chip, intended to be used as a reconfigurable processor for space applications.

Thanks to partial Reconfiguration features, FPGA becomes the golden core of the adaptive computation paradigm since they may dynamically change their functionalities based on the elaboration request. Today, adaptive computation is mainly controlled at a coarse-grain granularity while no solutions exist to act at the fine granularity level especially to reprogram the FPGA routing interconnection. The purpose of this work is to propose an embedded core able to reconfigure the routing resources without the usage of external computational units. The developed core implements a Path Finding-based algorithm able to perform the full routability of complex designs. The core has been devised minimizing the area overhead and the requested computational power by wisely selecting a suitable subset of wiring segments. The functionalities of the core have been tested on a Xilinx SRAM-based FPGAs Zynq device using three different circuit benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrated that the core is able to successfully re-route almost 95% of the selected nets without introducing a relevant delay or area overhead.","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046362.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self rerouting of dynamically reconfigurable SRAM-based FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Self rerouting of dynamically reconfigurable SRAM-based FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046362/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self rerouting of dynamically reconfigurable SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"25AHS2017paper15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050353S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046364,"authors":[{"name":"Keshav Singh","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Keshav","lastName":"Singh","id":"38548448300"},{"name":"Sudip Biswas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Biswas","id":"37085496487"},{"name":"Ankit Gupta","affiliation":["Aricent Technologies Limited (Holdings), Gurgaon, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086016544"},{"name":"Tharmalingam Ratnarajah","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tharmalingam","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37284633900"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Herriot Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046364","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","MIMO radar","Interference","Array signal processing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","radar signal processing","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power allocation","beamforming design","full-duplex MIMO cellular systems","spectrum sharing radar","wireless devices","ubiquitous services","authorized/licensed shared access","ASA/LSA","FD base station","multiple downlink","uplink users","radar detection probability","optimization technique","second-order cone programming","SOCP problem","spectral coexistence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex","multi-user MIMO","MIMO radar","optimization","opportunistic spectrum access","beamforming"]}],"abstract":"The new networking paradigm of opportunistic spectrum sharing is a promising technology for mitigating the scarcity of spectrum, which has resulted from the exponential increase in the number of wireless devices and ubiquitous services. In light of the new concept of Authorized/Licensed Shared Access (ASA/LSA), in this work, we consider the coexistence and spectrum sharing between a collocated multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar and a full-duplex (FD) multi-user MIMO cellular system consisting of a FD base station (BS) serving multiple downlink and uplink users simultaneously, and accordingly focus on maximizing the detection probability of the radar. The main objective of this paper is to develop an optimization technique for jointly optimizing the beamforming weights at the BS and transmit power for uplink users that can maximize the detection probability of radar while guaranteeing the quality-of-service requirements of each user and power budget for the uplink users and the BS. The joint beamforming design is a non-convex problem which, we convert into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem and propose an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of the spectral coexistence and show a scalable trade-off in performance of both systems.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046364","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046364.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power allocation and beamforming design for full-duplex MIMO cellular systems with spectrum sharing radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint power allocation and beamforming design for full-duplex MIMO cellular systems with spectrum sharing radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046364/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17193255","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046364/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power allocation and beamforming design for full-duplex MIMO cellular systems with spectrum sharing radar","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"27AHS2017paper21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174069S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046368,"authors":[{"name":"Unai Martinez-Corral","affiliation":["Dept.

There is an increasing interest in moving applications involving streamed data such as those arising in machine-learning systems (machine-vision, speech-recognition, etc.) to highly-integrated low-power embedded devices. In this context efficient memory utilization, which is critical to both performance and energy consumption, requires handling multiple memory resources and different address spaces. The proposed IP core cooperates with a companion interconnect IP that acts as an abstraction layer to allow seamless integration of such heterogeneous resources. Dynamic (re)allocation is supported, so that embedded memory resources (Block RAMs) and external blocks (DDR memory) can be transparently used. The coprocessor itself is a configurable vector-matrix product computer with optional non-linear filtering, thus any single layer and multilayer ANN model can be easily implemented. The applicability of the IPs is demonstrated in a Hyperspectral Image (HSI) real-time classification problem.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046368","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","startPage":"125","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully configurable and scalable neural coprocessor IP for SoC implementations of machine learning applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fully configurable and scalable neural coprocessor IP for SoC implementations of machine learning applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046368/","conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17193254","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully configurable and scalable neural coprocessor IP for SoC implementations of machine learning applications","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"31AHS2017paper34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106573S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046370,"authors":[{"name":"Godwin Enemali","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Godwin","lastName":"Enemali","id":"37085685646"},{"name":"Adewale Adetomi","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Adewale","lastName":"Adetomi","id":"37085765163"},{"name":"Tughrul Arslan","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Tughrul","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37273392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046370","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expanding the un-usable area strategy for improved utilization of reconfigurable FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046370","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Runtime","Hardware","Optimization","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unusable area strategy expansion","heterogeneous reconfigurable FPGA utilization","hard blocks","hardware task runtime relocation","permanent faults","task rejections","placement quality","LUT","Flip Flops","Xilinx xc7z100ffg900-2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","heterogenous platform","allocation","design optimization","runtime placement"]}],"abstract":"The addition of hard blocks such as Block RAMs and Digital Signal Processors, have proven to be good means of improving various performance metrics in FPGAs.

Although the radiation tolerance of data stored on EEPROMs is much higher than that stored on SRAMs, the radiation tolerance of the data on an EEPROM is not perfectly safe because electrons on the floating gates of transistors are also disturbed by strong radiation. If high-energy charged particles are incident to the EEPROM, then the EEPROM data might be destroyed by the radiation. In stark contrast, the radiation tolerances of holographic memories are perfect Recording and reading of holographic memory can be executed optically. They never depend on electrons or holes. Moreover, data stored on holographic memory are read by summations of numerous light waves. The operation can be regarded as a majority voting operation. Therefore, even if half of a holographic memory is removed, the remaining half of the holographic memory can generate recorded data correctly. This paper describes a holographic memory based FPGA or an optically reconfigurable gate array (ORGA). Furthermore, this paper explains that a holographic memory can function correctly up to a 500 Mrad total-ionizing-dose, exhibiting 1,667 times higher radiation tolerance than current radiation-hardened VLSIs and FPGAs.","publicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030149/8046338/08046374.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"500 Mrad total-ionizing-dose tolerance of a holographic memory on an optical FPGA","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2017.8046374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2017.8046374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"500 Mrad total-ionizing-dose tolerance of a holographic memory on an optical FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206071","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046374/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"500 Mrad total-ionizing-dose tolerance of a holographic memory on an optical FPGA","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"37AHS2017paper37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082831S","chronDate":"24-27 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030149","isNumber":"8046338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030149","xplore-issue":"8046338","articleId":"8046374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046378,"authors":[{"name":"Adewale Adetomi","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Adewale","lastName":"Adetomi","id":"37085765163"},{"name":"Godwin Enemali","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Godwin","lastName":"Enemali","id":"37085685646"},{"name":"Tughrul Arslan","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Tughrul","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37273392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2959-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3440-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-769X"}],"articleNumber":"8046378","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Engines","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Runtime","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","fault tolerant control","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant ICAP controller","selective-area soft error mitigation engine","dynamic partial reconfiguration","configuration memory","FPGA","task reconfiguration","mission-critical applications","CMEM interface","fault-tolerant controller","SEM engine","selective-area scanning","compromising reliability","Compositional InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer","CIRIS instrument","Xilinx SEM IP","data processing core"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","ICAP controller","partial reconfiguration","soft error mitigation"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) allows runtime access to the configuration memory (CMEM) of FPGAs.

And a communication channel model with high noise and high crosstalk is established for TSV array transmission. In this paper, a channel concatenated coding transmission scheme is proposed to apply the concatenated code to the TSV array transmission model. Its purpose is to optimize the transmission performance and realize the efficient transmission of the signal in the TSV array. In this case, channel noise is seen as White Gaussian Noise, and crosstalk is determined by the S parameters. Taking into account the coding efficiency and transmission efficiency, the Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is used as the inner code and the Hamming code is used as the outer code. The simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) performance improved at any information transmission rate, and the BER is lower than using LDPC code alone. Therefore, the channel concatenated coding transmission scheme can be used to achieve better TSV array signal transmission, overcome the transmission problem and improve transmission performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046546","startPage":"697","endPage":"702","publicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030508/8046389/08046546.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel concatenated coding transmission scheme for TSV array transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046546/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Channel concatenated coding transmission scheme for TSV array transmission","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17206168","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046546/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel concatenated coding transmission scheme for TSV array transmission","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"paper_155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061845S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030508","isNumber":"8046389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030508","xplore-issue":"8046389","articleId":"8046546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8046643,"authors":[{"name":"Baisen Hao","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Jointing Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Baisen","lastName":"Hao","id":"37086077823"},{"name":"Yunhui Mei","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Jointing Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yunhui","lastName":"Mei","id":"37533089300"},{"name":"Puqi Ning","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Puqi","lastName":"Ning","id":"37395420300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2971-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2973-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046643","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046643","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Multichip modules","Genetic algorithms","Finite element analysis","Copper","Power electronics","DNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integrated circuit layout","power electronics","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid genetic algorithm","automatic layout design","power module","parasitic parameters","switching losses","dynamic characteristics","integrated circuit technology","high current working environment","high frequency working environment","high pressure working environment","switching circuit delay","power consumption","Matlab","Q3D software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power module","automatic layout design","parasitic parameters","hybrid genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046643","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030508/8046389/08046643.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid genetic algorithm for automatic layout design of power module","abstract":"The parasitic parameters in the power module have a negative effect on switching losses and dynamic characteristics. With the rapid development of integrated circuit technology, the high current, high frequency and high pressure working environment put forward higher requirements for the switching circuit delay, reliability and power consumption. The rational layout of the power module is the key to reducing the parasitic parameters. However, today's designers often propose the layout manually, which is time- and money-consuming. Recently, automatic layout design of power modules has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm is used to design the layout automatically by MATLAB in order to optimize the layout with the lowest parasitic effect. Then we used the Q3D software to verify the automatic calculation results by comparing the calculated layout with some others in manual ways.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

LED lightings, as they combine the workability of polymer resins with the high thermal conductivity of fillers\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1-4]</sup>\n. The polymer resins endow adequate adhesion strength and provide sufficient mechanical robustness. The thermally conductive fillers mainly determine the capacity of heat dissipation; and the filler can be carbon nanotube, graphene, aluminum nitride, and metal, etc. Among the metallic filler materials, silver is regarded as a competitive TCA filler because of the superior thermal conductivity (~400 W\u00b7m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n\u00b7k\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n) and resistance to oxidization. The interfacial resistance can be dramatically reduced when sintering behavior is occurred. Yet, it is still a great challenge to fabricate silver-based TCA samples at low temperature with a relatively high thermal conductivity since it is hard to sinter at a moderate temperature. In this work, a simple surface treatment of silver micro-flakes is applied. Laser flash apparatus results show that the out-of-plane thermal conductivity of 85 wt% TCAs achieve 22 W\u00b7m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n\u00b7k\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\nwhen cured at 190 \u00b0C. The out-of-plane thermal conductivity of the TCA sample is ideal for applications in high-power thermal interface materials. It is notable that the surface treatment only simply includes two steps: hydrazine hydrate treatment and iodination treatment. A careful study on the influence factors such as surface treatment, curing temperature was conducted. The excellent heat conducting behavior renders the TCA with a good deal of future applications in high-power electron packaging.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046673","publicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030508/8046389/08046673.pdf","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silver pastes with excellent thermal conductivity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Silver pastes with excellent thermal conductivity","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046673/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206245","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silver pastes with excellent thermal conductivity","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"paper_289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10019S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030508","isNumber":"8046389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030508","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046389","articleId":"8046673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8046746,"authors":[{"name":"Shui-Bao Liang","affiliation":["Lab of Smart Materials and Electronic Packaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering R&D Center of Electronic Packaging Materials and Reliability"],"firstName":"Shui-Bao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085587413"},{"name":"Cheng Wei","affiliation":["Lab of Smart Materials and Electronic Packaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering R&D Center of Electronic Packaging Materials and Reliability","School of Civil Engineering and Transportation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086131593"},{"name":"Chang-Bo Ke","affiliation":["Lab of Smart Materials and Electronic Packaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering R&D Center of Electronic Packaging Materials and Reliability"],"firstName":"Chang-Bo","lastName":"Ke","id":"37085542917"},{"name":"Min-Bo Zhou","affiliation":["Lab of Smart Materials and Electronic Packaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering R&D Center of Electronic Packaging Materials and Reliability"],"firstName":"Min-Bo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38561314300"},{"name":"Xin-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Lab of Smart Materials and Electronic Packaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering R&D Center of Electronic Packaging Materials and Reliability"],"firstName":"Xin-Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086128594"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2972-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2971-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2973-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046746","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Dielectrics","Silicon","Young's modulus","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","elasticity","finite element analysis","grain growth","Monte Carlo methods","thermal expansion","thermal stresses","thermomechanical treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstructure simulation","finite element method","grain characteristics","three-dimensional packaging","TSV structure","thermal load","copper grains","grain growth","Monte Carlo method","grain evolution","thermal expansion coefficient","copper filler","protrusion","FEM","physical properties","thermal stress","elastic response","Cu-Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cu-filled TSV","thermo-mechanical behavior","grain growth","Monte Carlo method","finite element method"]}],"abstract":"Grain characteristics of copper filler have an important influence on physical properties of through silicon vias (TSVs) in three-dimensional (3D) packaging. Due to the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between the copper and silicon, there exist obvious thermal stresses when the TSV structure is bearing thermal load. However, the elastic response characteristics of copper can be affected distinctly by the size, shape and orientation of copper grains in TSVs. These effects can not be ignored, especially for 3D ICs undergoing continuous miniaturization and increasing integration. In this study, the grain growth and evolution of a typical copper filler in the TSV structure is dynamically simulated and investigated by using Monte Carlo method (MCM), then the thermo-mechanical behavior of TSVs with considering the grain characteristics of copper filler is studied with combined MCM and finite element method (FEM), i.e., MC-FE method. Besides, the effects of grain evolution on the protrusion of copper filler in the TSV is also investigated. Simulation results are presented for providing more quantitative description and comprehensive understanding of the influences of microstructure evolution of copper filler on the thermo-mechanical behavior of Cu-filled TSVs.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046746","publicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 18th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8030508/8046389/08046746.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046389","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstructure simulation and thermo-mechanical behavior analysis of Cu-filled through silicon vias (TSVs) using combined Monte Carlo and finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046746","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microstructure simulation and thermo-mechanical behavior analysis of Cu-filled through silicon vias (TSVs) using combined Monte Carlo and finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046746/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206402","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046746/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstructure simulation and thermo-mechanical behavior analysis of Cu-filled through silicon vias (TSVs) using combined Monte Carlo and finite element method","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"paper_365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065294S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8030508","isNumber":"8046389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8030508","xplore-issue":"8046389","articleId":"8046746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046772,"authors":[{"name":"Udit Pareek","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Udit","lastName":"Pareek","id":"37540416000"},{"name":"Daniel C.

We identify seven similarities and differences, and discuss how these could be leveraged to improve streaming video content delivery on the Internet in the future.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Games","Internet","Protocols","YouTube","TV","Data collection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","protocols","telecommunication traffic","video on demand","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["campus-level view","Netflix","Twitch","video streaming services","Internet traffic","campus edge network","video-on-demand","live-streaming","traffic patterns","protocol usage","content popularity"]}],"doi":"10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046774","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8036489/8046764/08046774.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046764","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A campus-level view of Netflix and Twitch: Characterization and performance implications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A campus-level view of Netflix and Twitch: Characterization and performance implications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046774/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046774/","accessionNumber":"17206831","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A campus-level view of Netflix and Twitch: Characterization and performance implications","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"27FinalPaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071451S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8036489","isNumber":"8046764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8036489","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8046764","articleId":"8046774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Society for Modelling and Simulation International","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8046780,"authors":[{"name":"Floriano De Rango","affiliation":["DIMES, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Floriano","lastName":"De Rango","id":"37280190100"},{"name":"Nunzia Palmieri","affiliation":["DIMES, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Nunzia","lastName":"Palmieri","id":"38468308100"},{"name":"Amilcare Francesco Santamaria","affiliation":["DIMES, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Amilcare Francesco","lastName":"Santamaria","id":"37700444600"},{"name":"Giuseppe Potrino","affiliation":["DIMES, University of Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Potrino","id":"37086076490"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0529-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046780","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Agriculture","Monitoring","Wireless sensor networks","Insects","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","autonomous aerial vehicles","crops","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulator","UAV management","agriculture domain","drones","unmanned aerial vehicles","land monitoring","crop","UAV team","coordination techniques","control techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV team","Team Management","Simulator","Agriculture Domain","Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046780","doi":"10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046764","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8036489/8046764/08046780.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulator for UAVs management in agriculture domain","abstract":"Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) receive a growing interest for agricultural purposes. The aim is to provide inspiring insights in this domain from a technological and computational point of view. In these last years, indeed, there is an enormous potential that UAV technologies presents to support the agricultural domain in monitoring the land for checking and countering the presence of parasites that can damage the crop. However, to properly manage a UAVs team, equipped with multiple sensors and actuators, it is necessary to test these technologies and design proper strategies and coordination techniques able to efficiently manage the team. At this purpose, the paper proposes a simulator suitable for the agriculture domain in order to design novel coordination and control techniques of a UAVs team. Moreover it is possible to define the main variables and parameters of this domain of interest. The work presented many coordination techniques both for monitoring the area and both for coordinating the actions of the drones in the presence of parasites in order to analyze how the performance can significantly change if more constraints, such as energy, communication range, resource capacities, are accounted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046780/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17206827","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A simulator for UAVs management in agriculture domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulator for UAVs management in agriculture domain","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"38FinalPaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07706S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8036489","isNumber":"8046764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8036489","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8046764","articleId":"8046780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Society for Modelling and Simulation International","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8046784,"authors":[{"name":"Alisha Thapaliya","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada"],"firstName":"Alisha","lastName":"Thapaliya","id":"37086030111"},{"name":"Shamik Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada"],"firstName":"Shamik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37288180900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0529-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046784","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046784","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Switches","Machine learning algorithms","Interference","Prediction algorithms","Dynamic spectrum access","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","optimisation","radio spectrum management","regression analysis","support vector machines","telecommunication computing","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","game theoretic environment","dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio","unlicensed secondary users","licensed bands","game theoretic competition","optimal strategy","predictive algorithms","linear regression","support vector regression","elastic net","self-learning approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Networks","Self-Coexistence","Game Theory","Machine Learning","Prediction","Linear Regression","Support Vector Regression","Elastic Net"]}],"doi":"10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046784","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8036489/8046764/08046784.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in a game theoretic environment for dynamic spectrum access","abstract":"The key enabling technology in dynamic spectrum access is Cognitive Radio that allows unlicensed secondary users to access the licensed bands without causing any interference to the primary users. In any situation where there are a certain number of secondary networks trying to get an available channel, there arises a game theoretic competition where they want to get the channel for themselves by incurring as minimum cost as possible. The increase in cost is equivalent to the increase in time caused by the need of a search for an available channel. This process could be sped up if the networks had a predictive mechanism to determine the optimal strategy. In this paper, we investigate various predictive algorithms: Linear regression, Support Vector Regression and Elastic Net and compare them with other traditional non-predictive game theoretic mechanisms. We measure the accuracy of these algorithms in terms of time taken to reach the system convergence. We also observe how a self-learning approach can be helpful in maximizing utilities of the players in comparison to traditional game theoretic approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046784/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17206828","publicationDate":"July 2017","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046784/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in a game theoretic environment for dynamic spectrum access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in a game theoretic environment for dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"9FinalPaper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076256S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8036489","isNumber":"8046764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8036489","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8046764","articleId":"8046784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Society for Modelling and Simulation International","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8046817,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Aldag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Helmut, University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Aldag","id":"37086053668"},{"name":"Joachim Horn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Helmut, University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Horn","id":"37324993900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2403-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6766-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046817","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"The performance of a gearless servo system is significantly degraded by mechanical resonances present in the system.

The performance of these algorithms is shown on a test axis and on a round table with a direct torque motor on a machine. It will furthermore be shown that multiple resonances present on the machine can be damped subsequently and the controller gains can be increased to improve the overall tracking performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Reluctance motors","Process control","Signal processing algorithms","Servomotors","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","closed loop systems","damping","frequency control","identification","sensorless machine control","servomechanisms","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonance peak damping","adaptive notch filters","gearless servo drives","mechanical resonance frequency identification","closed loop control system","control frequency","direct torque motor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046817","publicationTitle":"2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8035192/8046786/08046817.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping of resonance peaks using adaptive notch filters in gearless servo drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Damping of resonance peaks using adaptive notch filters in gearless servo drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8046817/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8046817/","accessionNumber":"17206779","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of resonance peaks using adaptive notch filters in gearless servo drives","confLoc":"Miedzyzdroje, Poland","sourcePdf":"B2LB016174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044609S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8035192","isNumber":"8046786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8035192","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8046786","articleId":"8046817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8046837,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Sztandera","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Sztandera","id":"37086058447"},{"name":"Katarzyna Wiechetek","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Poland"],"firstName":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wiechetek","id":"37086052451"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2402-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2403-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6766-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8046837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Frequency response","Time-frequency analysis","Filtering","Genetic algorithms","Time-varying systems","Filtration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","frequency response","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary filtering network","genetic algorithms","1st order elements","assumed error function","transition processes","time function","learning process","assumed frequency response","time constant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["filtering network","nonstationary filter","frequency response","time-varying parameters","transient state","genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8046837","abstract":"In the paper a concept of nonstationary network consisted of 1st order elements is presented.

Classification is done by Neural Networks, k-nearest neighbor method, and random forest independently, too. LBP counts several binary patterns that occur in the image. GLCM is a kind of statistical approach that uses homogeneity, contrast, energy, and correlation information from pixels. RBO counts the binary relations of neighboring pixels in a box filter to get textural features for image processing. The leading test results are obtained from the LBP method for features and random forest data structure for classification. For example, agricultural seed type classification is obtained with LBP features and random forest classification with an accuracy of 99.5% and leaf classification with 93.5% accuracy.

For this purpose, deep learning was used to detect the various diseases on the leaves of tomato plants. In the study, it was aimed that the deep learning algorithm should be run in real time on the robot. So the robot will be able to detect the diseases of the plants while wandering manually or autonomously on the field or in the greenhouse. Likewise, diseases can also be detected from close-up photographs taken from plants by sensors built in fabricated greenhouses. The examined diseases in this study cause physical changes in the leaves of the tomato plant. These changes on the leaves can be seen with RGB cameras. In the previous studies, standard feature extraction methods on plant leaf images to detect diseases have been used. In this study, deep learning methods were used to detect diseases. Deep learning architecture selection was the key issue for the implementation. So that, two different deep learning network architectures were tested first AlexNet and then SqueezeNet.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of unmanned aerial vehicle for the monitoring barley growth. Unmanned aerial vehicle imagery obtained from middle February to late June in Wanju, Jeollabuk-do. Unmanned aerial vehicle imagery corrected geometrically and atmospherically to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We analyzed the relationships between NDVI\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">UAV</sub>\n of barley and biophysical measurements such as plant height, number of tiller and shoot dry weight over an entire barley growth period. The similar trend between NDVIUAV and growth parameters was shown. Correlation analysis between NDVIUAV and barley growth parameters revealed that NDVIUAV was highly correlated with shoot dry weight (r=0.932) and plant height (r=0.879). According to the relationship among growth parameters and NDVIUAV, the temporal variation of NDVIUAV was significant to interpret barley growth. The spatial distribution map of barley growth was in strong agreement with the field measurements in terms of geographical variation and relative numerical values when NDVIUAV was applied to power function. From these results, NDVIUAV can be used as a new tool for monitoring barley growth.","doi":"10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047029","publicationTitle":"2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 6th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8031504/8046248/08047029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2017.8047029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8046248","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping the spatial distribution of barley growth based on unmanned aerial vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mapping the spatial distribution of barley growth based on unmanned aerial vehicle","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047029/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206548","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047029/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping the spatial distribution of barley growth based on unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"AgroGeoinformatics2017paper105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109202S","chronDate":"7-10 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8031504","isNumber":"8046248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031504","xplore-issue":"8046248","articleId":"8047029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8047132,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yan","affiliation":["Jilin Bus. & Technol.

As each wireless communication rule has different application scene applicability and different communication effects, this paper proposed a communication rules learning strategy based on SVN neural network. This strategy obtained learning samples which indicate the communication mode with best communication performance through simulation of various application scenes in OPENT Modeler.

The developed scheme is based on a three time slots cooperative spectrum sharing, which exploits the maximum diversity gain for both the primary user (PU) and secondary user (SU). The performance of the developed scheme is assessed through the derivation of new closed-form expressions for both the bit error rate and achievable rate for arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, we carry out an asymptotic analysis in the high SNR regime, which proves that the proposed scheme achieves a full diversity order for the PU and SU.

The proposed system overcomes existing limitations in terms of unmanned aerial vehicle positioning and data geo-referring accuracy using a real-time kinematic positioning system to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. Amplitude-only measurements acquired using a low-cost power sensor are processed by means of the phaseless sources reconstruction method. This is an iterative phase retrieval technique that allows recovering an equivalent currents distribution, which characterizes the antenna under test (AUT). From these equivalent currents, near-field to far-field transformation is applied to calculate the AUT radiation pattern. This contribution also analyzes probe antenna characterization and the impact of positioning and geo-referring accuracy on the radiation pattern. Two application examples of antenna measurement at Sand C-bands using the implemented system are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antenna radiation patterns","Current measurement","Phase measurement","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna testing","autonomous aerial vehicles","Global Positioning System","iterative methods","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude-only measurements","low-cost power sensor","iterative phase retrieval technique","AUT radiation pattern","antenna characterization","antenna measurement","antenna diagnostics","unmanned aerial vehicles","low-cost unmanned aerial system","unmanned aerial vehicle positioning","data geo-referring accuracy","real-time kinematic positioning system","centimeter-level accuracy","equivalent current distribution","phaseless source reconstruction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","antenna measurement","antenna diagnostics","real time kinematic (RTK)","phaseless measurements","near-field to far-field transformation (NF-FF)","sources reconstruction method (SRM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047243","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754985","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047243.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754985","startPage":"23563","endPage":"23575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Diagnostics and Characterization Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Diagnostics and Characterization Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047243/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8047243/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381104","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a of Spain/FEDER","grantNumber":"TEC2014-54005-P (MIRIIEM), TEC2015-73908-JIN, TEC2014-55290-JIN (PORTEMVISION) and FPU15/06341"},{"fundingName":"Principado de Asturias, through the Plan de Ciencia, Tecnolog\u00eda e lnnovaci\u00f3n 2013\u20132017","grantNumber":"GRUPIN14-114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008425","fundingName":"Galician Regional Government and the Plan I2C (2011\u20132015)","grantNumber":"CN2012/279 and CN2012/260 (AtlantTIC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Antenna Diagnostics and Characterization Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"access-alvarezlopez-2754985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088499S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047243","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047244,"authors":[{"name":"Deliang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8047244/xu-2754515-small.gif","p":["Deliang Xu received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the Hubei University of Technology, China.

The encryption card provides hardware cryptographic services for users and is believed to be superior to software cryptography. However, we cannot use the encryption card directly in the user domain because of the complicated virtualization mechanisms and the security problems about the user key and the user private data flow. To address these challenges, we propose a new virtualization architecture to ensure the trustworthiness of encryption cards. First, we design a privacy preserving model to ensure the security of the dynamic schedule of encryption cards. Second, we present a hardware trust verification procedure based on the trusted platform module to supply a trusted virtualization hardware foundation. Third, we provide a series of security protocols to establish a trusted chain between users and encryption cards. Finally, we give security proofs of the encryption card virtualization architecture. Based on our prototype implementation, the encryption service provided by the encryption card has higher-level security and higher efficiency than software encryption. It provides strong support for security services of virtualization systems in cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047244.pdf","startPage":"20652","endPage":"20667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtualization of the Encryption Card for Trust Access in Cloud Computing","topic":"Internet-of-Things (IoT) Big Data Trust Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047244/","displayDocTitle":"Virtualization of the Encryption Card for Trust Access in Cloud Computing","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8047244/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17515802","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China NSF","grantNumber":"61572222, 61272405, 61672249, 61772194, 61472121, 61272033 and 61272451"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Virtualization of the Encryption Card for Trust Access in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"access-fu-2754515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096452S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Internet-of-Things (IoT) Big Data Trust Management"],"articleId":"8047244","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047245,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8064976/8047245/xli-2754502-small.gif","p":["Xiang Li (M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, China, in 2015.

By introducing several non-convex penalty functions to approximate both the rank function and the sparse penalty function in the original Robust PCA problem, we establish a non-convex objective function and solve it efficiently by the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method and difference of convex programming technique. This framework creates the opportunity to safely perform localization with dimension reduction by standard PCA, which has well-known fragile characteristics in the presence of outliers. Thus, the localization algorithms obtained by sparse coding provide the benefits of computational efficiency in low-dimension. The device-free localization (DFL) experiment on a real-world data set shows the improvement in localization accuracy after standard PCA in the presence of outliers. A statistical distance, called the Wasserstein distance, is introduced to evaluate the processed result of outlier suppression, illustrating that the proposed approach can identify and eliminate outliers in DFL problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","volume":"17","issue":"21","accessionNumber":"17241325","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047245/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outlier Suppression via Non-Convex Robust PCA for Efficient Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"2016 Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan","grantNumber":"16K00335"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outlier Suppression via Non-Convex Robust PCA for Efficient Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-li-2754502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095897S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8064976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8064976","articleId":"8047245","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047246,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Gu","affiliation":["Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Affective Computing and Advanced Intelligent Machine, School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8172502/8047246/gu-2754578-small.gif","p":["Yu Gu (M\u201914\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.E. degree from the Special Classes for the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004, and the D.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2010.","In 2006, he was an Intern with Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, for seven months.

Recent developments in the field of indoor motion detection have revealed their potentials in enhancing our living experiences through applications like intrusion detection and sleep monitoring. However, existing solutions still face several critical downsides such as the availability (specialized hardware), reliability (illumination and line-of-sight constraints), and privacy issues (being watched). To overcome such shortages, a radio frequency (RF) based device-free motion detection system (MoSense) is designed via leveraging the attenuation of ubiquitous WiFi signals induced by motions to deliver a reliable and transparent detection service in realtime. The design and implementation of MoSense face two challenges: 1) characterizing stationary states and 2) the noisy subcarriers. For the first challenge, a silence analysis model is proposed to characterize stationary states for distinguishing motions. For the second challenge, we design a distance-based mechanism to select certain subcarriers that better capture the impact of motions from the noisy channel through measuring the similarity between subcarriers. A prototype of MoSense is realized and evaluated in real environments. By comparing MoSense with other two state-of-the-art systems, i.e., FIMD and FRID, we have shown that MoSense is superior in terms of precision, false negative rate and computational complexity. Considering that MoSense is compatible with existing WiFi infrastructure, it constitutes a low-cost yet promising solution for motion detection.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2754578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8172502/08047246.pdf","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2754578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8172502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MoSense: An RF-Based Motion Detection System via Off-the-Shelf WiFi Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"MoSense: An RF-Based Motion Detection System via Off-the-Shelf WiFi Devices","volume":"4","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17541306","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047246/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MoSense: An RF-Based Motion Detection System via Off-the-Shelf WiFi Devices","sourcePdf":"jiot-gu-2754578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102251S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8172502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8172502","articleId":"8047246","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047250,"authors":[{"name":"Mateen Ashraf","affiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8047250/ashra-2747085-small.gif","p":["Mateen Ashraf received the B.

The base station (BS) serves two types of users, which are named relay user (RU) and far user (FU). The BS and RU are equipped with multiple transmit antennas. The RU harvests energy from the BS transmissions to perform the relaying operation for the FU. We have considered 1) amplify-forward; 2) decode-forward; and 3) quantize-map-forward relaying protocols at the RU. As the BS and RU have multiple antennas, therefore we consider 1) beamforming and 2) random antenna selection strategies at the BS and RU. Closed form expressions for the outage probability are provided for the aforementioned relay protocols and antenna strategies. Further, we show that for certain data rate range of the relay and FU the quantize-map-forward relaying protocol can perform better than the other two relaying protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2747085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047250.pdf","startPage":"17660","endPage":"17670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2747085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System With Multi-Antenna Relay and Base Station","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System With Multi-Antenna Relay and Base Station","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047250/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17246481","htmlLink":"/document/8047250/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIT) (A Study on Hyper Connected Self-Organizing Network Infrastructure Technologies for IoT Service)","grantNumber":"B0126-16-1051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1D1A1A09059026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Harvesting Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access System With Multi-Antenna Relay and Base Station","sourcePdf":"access-ashraf-2747085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080138S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047250","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047254,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Lin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, St. John\u2019s, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0003-1737-2348","id":"37085851075"},{"name":"Yahia A.

The proposed algorithm classifies the modulation format from several possible candidates by differentiating the cumulative distribution function (cdf) curves of their normalized amplitudes. The candidate with the most similar cdf to the received signal is selected. The measure of similarity is the minimum average distance between these cdfs. Five commonly used quadrature amplitude modulation formats in digital coherent optical systems are employed. Optical back-to-back experiments and extended simulations are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves accurate classification at optical signal-to-noise ratios of interest.

This is due to the fact that transmitter can only release a positive amount of concentration of a specific molecule into the medium. Previous works have proposed use of chemical reactions to remove molecules from the environment, and to effectively simulate negative signals. However, the differential equation describing a diffusion-reaction process is non-linear. This precludes the possibility of using Fourier transform tools. In this paper, a solution for simulating negative signals based on the diffusion-reaction channel model is proposed. While the proposed solution does not exploit the full degrees of freedom available for signaling in a diffusion-reaction process, but its end-to-end system is a linear channel and amenable to Fourier transform analysis. Based on our solution, a modulation scheme and a precoder are introduced and shown to have a significant reduction in error probability compared with previous modulation schemes, such as concentration shift keying (CSK), pre-equalization, depleted-molecule shift keying (D-MoSK), and molecular concentration shift keying (MCSK). The effects of various imperfections (such as quantization error) on the communication system performance are studied.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08047260.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Type-Based Sign Modulation and Its Application for ISI Mitigation in Molecular Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Type-Based Sign Modulation and Its Application for ISI Mitigation in Molecular Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047260/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519952","htmlLink":"/document/8047260/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) Research Grant on Nano-Network Communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Type-Based Sign Modulation and Its Application for ISI Mitigation in Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gohari-2754492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119364S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8047260","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047264,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Chegeni","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Chegeni","orcid":"0000-0001-5412-7945","id":"38095196600"},{"name":"Khayrollah Hadidi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Khayrollah","lastName":"Hadidi","id":"37276767900"},{"name":"Abdollah Khoei","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdollah","lastName":"Khoei","id":"37276775200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8047264","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Estimation","Error analysis","Calibration","Operational amplifiers","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","comparators (circuits)","error correction","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["histogram-based background interstage error estimation","ADC output histogram","pipelined ADC","interstage gain error estimation","subDAC nonlinearity","comparator memory error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pipelined ADCs","digital background calibration","histogram"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047264","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08047264.pdf","startPage":"1519","endPage":"1523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754639","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Histogram-Based Background Interstage Error Estimation and Implementation Method in Pipelined ADCs","abstract":"This brief presents a new method to estimate the interstage gain error and sub-DAC nonlinearity in pipelined ADCs, regardless of the number of bits per stage.

Such factors as PN junctions, guard ring structures, active areas, and back-end structures are considered for the optimization. CMOS-APDs reflecting varying aspects of these factors are fabricated and their performances are characterized. In addition, their characteristics are analyzed with technology computer-aided-design simulations and equivalent circuit models. From these investigations, dominant factors that influence the CMOS-APD performance are identified. Furthermore, three different techniques enabling further performance improvements of CMOS-APDs are investigated, which are spatial-modulation, carrier-acceleration, and multijunction techniques. The state-of-the-art CMOS-APDs' structures and performances are presented and compared, and the best optimized CMOS-APD is proposed. These results should be extremely useful for realizing optimal silicon APDs in standard CMOS technology for various applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2754359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/7985003/08047267.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7985003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2754359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Optimization and Improvement of Silicon Avalanche Photodetectors in Standard CMOS Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Optimization and Improvement of Silicon Avalanche Photodetectors in Standard CMOS Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047267/","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8047267/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"3801013","publicationDate":"March-April 2018","accessionNumber":"17246521","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A2A01007772"},{"fundingName":"Materials and Parts Technology R&D Program"},{"fundingName":"Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy","grantNumber":"10065666"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Optimization and Improvement of Silicon Avalanche Photodetectors in Standard CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"jstqe-lee-2754359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096457S","chronDate":"March-April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"7985003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7985003","articleId":"8047267","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047269,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Aminul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8047269/islam-2755002-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Aminul Islam (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in\n electrical and electronic engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in\n 2005.

In return, the community has turned to density-based imputation (e.g., Sugeno \u03bb-FM) or the number of interactions (FM variables) are restricted (e.g., k-additivity). Herein, we propose a new scalable data-driven way to represent and learn the ChI, making learning computationally manageable for larger N. First, data supported variables are identified and used in optimization. Identification of these variables also allows us recognize future ill-posed fusion scenarios; ChIs involving variable subsets not supported by data. Second, we outline an imputation function framework to address data unsupported variables. Third, we present a lossless way to compress redundant variables and associated monotonicity constraints. Finally, we outline a lossy approximation method to further compress the ChI (if/when desired). Computational complexity analysis and experiments conducted on synthetic datasets with known FMs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047269/","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17973518","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Compression and Efficient Learning of the Choquet Integral","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Compression and Efficient Learning of the Choquet Integral","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-islam-2755002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103981S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8047269","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8047270,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Tao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8047270/tao-2754999-small.gif","p":["Jie Tao was born in 1990.

Considering the random fluctuations of network conditions, the randomly occurred quantization is introduced to describe the quantization phenomenon appearing in a probabilistic way. To take full advantage of the partial information of system modes for the desired system performance, we adopt the asynchronous filter in which mode transition matrix is nonhomogeneous. The mode-dependent time-varying delays are introduced, which have different bounds for different system modes. Via fuzzy-mode-dependent Lyapunov functional approach that can reduce conservatism, a sufficient condition on the existence of the asynchronous filter is derived such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and strictly (Q, S, R)-dissipative. Then, the gains of the filter are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example is utilized to illustrate the validity of the developed filter design technique where the relationships among optimal dissipative performance indices, delays, quantization parameter, and the degree of asynchronous jumps are given.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2754999","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8424402/08047270.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2754999","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Filtering of Nonlinear Markov Jump Systems With Randomly Occurred Quantization via T\u2013S Fuzzy Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Filtering of Nonlinear Markov Jump Systems With Randomly Occurred Quantization via T\u2013S Fuzzy Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047270/","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8047270/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17973507","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP170102644"},{"fundingName":"Science Fund for Creative Research Groups"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61621002, U1611262, 61773131 and U1509217"},{"fundingName":"China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists","grantNumber":"61425009"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR16F030001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Filtering of Nonlinear Markov Jump Systems With Randomly Occurred Quantization via T\u2013S Fuzzy Models","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lu-2754999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20213S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8047270","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8047273,"authors":[{"name":"Ali J.

The PEP is used to obtain the upper-bounds for convolutionally coded and turbo coded massive MIMO-OFDM systems for different code generators and receive antennas. In addition, complexity analysis of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values is performed using the approximate noise probability density function. The derived LLR computations can be time-consuming when the number of receive antennas is very large in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. Thus, a reduced complexity approximation is introduced using Newton's interpolation with different polynomial orders and the results are compared with the exact simulations. The Neumann large matrix approximation is used to design the receiver for a zero-forcing equalizer by reducing the number of operations required in calculating the channel matrix inverse. Simulations are used to demonstrate that the results obtained using the derived equations match closely the Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2749370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2749370","startPage":"5244","endPage":"5256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8214934/08047273.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Coded Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Effective Matrix Inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Coded Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Effective Matrix Inversion","volume":"65","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17431438","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047273/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N004299/1"},{"fundingName":"Cooperative Backhaul Aided Next-Generation Digital Subscriber Loops"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Performance Analysis of Coded Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Effective Matrix Inversion","sourcePdf":"tcomm-alaskery-2749370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123803S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8214934","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8214934","articleId":"8047273","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047276,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, CAS, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8097365/8047276/wang-2754499-small.gif","p":["Quan Wang received the PhD degree in probability and statistics from\n Peking University, in 2013.

In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2017","volume":"29","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17352594","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2017","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047276/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey of Approaches and Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016QY03D0503 and 2016QY03D0505"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402465 and 61502477"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Theory and Cutting Edge Technology Research Program"},{"fundingName":"Institute of Information Engineering"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"Y7Z0261101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey of Approaches and Applications","sourcePdf":"tkde-wang-2754499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225278S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8097365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"8097365","articleId":"8047276","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047278,"authors":[{"name":"Margarita Gapeyenko","affiliation":["Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/8047278/gapey-2754543-small.gif","p":["Margarita Gapeyenko received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication\n engineering from the University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland, in 2014, and the B.Sc. degree in radio-engineering,\n electronics, and telecommunications from Karaganda State Technical University, Karaganda, Kazakhstan, in 2012.

In contrast to microwave systems, at shorter mmWave wavelengths such blockage can be caused by human bodies, where their mobility within environment makes wireless channel alternate between the blocked and non-blocked LoS states. Following the recent 3GPP requirements on modeling the dynamic blockage as well as the temporal consistency of the channel at mmWave frequencies, in this paper, a new model for predicting the state of a user in the presence of mobile blockers for representative 3GPP scenarios is developed: Urban micro cell street canyon and park/stadium/square. It is demonstrated that the blockage effects produce an alternating renewal process with exponentially distributed non-blocked intervals, and blocked durations that follow the general distribution. The following metrics are derived 1) the mean and the fraction of time spent in blocked/non-blocked state, 2) the residual blocked/non-blocked time, and 3) the time-dependent conditional probability of having blockage/no blockage at time t1 given that there was blockage/no blockage at time t0. The latter is a function of the arrival rate (intensity), width, and height of moving blockers, distance to the mmWave access point (AP), as well as the heights of the AP and the user device. The proposed model can be used for system-level characterization of mmWave cellular communication systems. For example, the optimal height and the maximum coverage radius of the mmWave APs are derived, while satisfying the required mean data rate constraint. The system-level simulations corroborate that the use of the proposed method considerably reduces the modeling complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Temporal Effects of Mobile Blockers in Urban Millimeter-Wave Cellular Scenarios","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2754543","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/08047278.pdf","startPage":"10124","endPage":"10138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2754543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Temporal Effects of Mobile Blockers in Urban Millimeter-Wave Cellular Scenarios","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8047278/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372549","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"},{"fundingName":"WiFiUS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Researcher"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingName":"Jorma Ollila"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Temporal Effects of Mobile Blockers in Urban Millimeter-Wave Cellular Scenarios","sourcePdf":"tvt-gapeyenko-2754543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119306S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8047278","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047280,"authors":[{"name":"Karen Junius","affiliation":["Robotics & Multibody Mechanics research group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Junius","orcid":"0000-0003-2502-1214","id":"37085407406"},{"name":"Nina Lefeber","affiliation":["Department of Physical Education and Physiotherapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nina","lastName":"Lefeber","orcid":"0000-0002-3311-6064","id":"37086379157"},{"name":"Eva Swinnen","affiliation":["Department of Physical Education and Physiotherapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Swinnen","orcid":"0000-0002-3771-9479","id":"37086378141"},{"name":"Bram Vanderborght","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Flanders Make"],"firstName":"Bram","lastName":"Vanderborght","orcid":"0000-0003-4881-9341","id":"37295389300"},{"name":"Dirk Lefeber","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Flanders Make"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Lefeber","id":"37295410400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"8047280","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exoskeletons","Hip","Kinematics","Muscles","Legged locomotion","Prototypes","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","electromyography","gait analysis","kinematics","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinematically compatible hip exoskeleton","kinematically compatible joint structures","sit-to-stand motions","rectus femoris","tibialis anterior","biceps femoris","gluteus maximus","natural motion patterns","reduced oxygen consumption","exoskeleton applications","metabolic effects","muscle activity","time 5.0 min"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exoskeletons","human-robot interaction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Biomechanical Phenomena","Equipment Design","Exoskeleton Device","Female","Hip","Humans","Male","Movement","Muscle, Skeletal","Oxygen Consumption","Posture","Rehabilitation","Torque"]}],"abstract":"Objective: Show the benefit of kinematically compatible joint structures in exoskeletons for improving their performance in reducing metabolic consumption. Methods: Subjects were fitted with a hip exoskeleton, with misalignment compensation for all degrees of freedom and were instructed to perform recurring sit-to-stand motions for 5 min. This was executed three times: Unequipped (i.e., not wearing the exoskeleton), assisted, and unassisted. During each trial, oxygen consumption and muscle activity were monitored. Results: An increased oxygen consumption was observed between the unequipped and the unassisted trial. During the assisted trial, oxygen consumption was reduced to levels seen in the unequipped state. Muscle activity increased for rectus femoris and tibialis anterior and decreased for biceps femoris and gluteus maximus. Conclusion: Oxygen consumption only increases in accordance with the added mass. No added penalty was seen related to increased inertia or hindrance of natural motion patterns. This indicates that the mechanism operates as intended. The increased muscle activity can be explained by the nature of the actuation system, which is not optimized for sit-to-stand tasks. A more targeted actuation system can easily reduce muscle activity, and therefore, induce a reduced oxygen consumption, below unequipped levels. Significance: Because the benefits induced by using these systems are independent of user capabilities or deficiencies, it is applicable in a wide range of exoskeleton applications. The design presented here, allows for the realization of compact and light devices, that have a minimal impact on the metabolic cost of their user. This allows to maximally exploit the metabolically beneficial effects of a well-designed actuation system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metabolic Effects Induced by a Kinematically Compatible Hip Exoskeleton During STS","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2754922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8360977/08047280.pdf","startPage":"1399","endPage":"1409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2754922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8360977","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Metabolic Effects Induced by a Kinematically Compatible Hip Exoskeleton During STS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8047280/","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17768279","pubMedId":"28945586","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Flemisch Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology for the MIRAD project","grantNumber":"IWT-SBO 120057"},{"fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"687662"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metabolic Effects Induced by a Kinematically Compatible Hip Exoskeleton During STS","sourcePdf":"tbme-junius-2754922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096304S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8360977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8360977","articleId":"8047280","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047281,"authors":[{"name":"Ruozhu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal QC H3A 0G4, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8047281/li-2754489-small.gif","p":["Ruozhu Li received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from\n the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2014, the M.Eng. degree in electrical\n engineering from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2017."]},"firstName":"Ruozhu","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-6242-6416","id":"37085699142"},{"name":"Ahmed Masmoudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal QC H3A 0G4, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8318405/8047281/masmo-2754489-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Masmoudi was born in Ariana, Tunisia.

In particular, we develop a new scheme to jointly estimate and cancel the in-phase/quadrature mixer imbalance, power amplifier nonlinearities, up-/down-conversion phase noise, and the SI channel. First, we develop a detailed baseband model that captures the most significant transceiver RF imperfections, for both separate- and common-oscillator structures used in the up- and down-conversions. Then, a basis expansion model is derived to approximate the time-varying phase noise and to transform the problem of estimating the time-varying phase noise into the estimation of a set of time-invariant coefficients. Subsequently, the likelihood function is derived in the presence of the unknown intended signal to formulate the joint estimation of the intended channel, SI channel, nonlinear impairments, and phase noise, under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. An iterative procedure is developed to find the ML estimate of the different parameters based on the known transmitted data, the known pilot symbols, and the statistics of the unknown intended signal received from the intended transmitter. The full use of the received signal significantly reduces the required number of pilot symbols as compared to training-based techniques. We consider the two pilot-insertion structures used in LTE for the frequency-multiplexed pilots and the time-multiplexed pilots. Simulation results indicate that the proposed ML algorithms can offer a superior SI-cancellation performance with the resulting intended-signal-to-SI-and-noise ratio very close to the intended-signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2754489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8318405/08047281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2754489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318405","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Interference Cancellation With Nonlinearity and Phase-Noise Suppression in Full-Duplex Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self-Interference Cancellation With Nonlinearity and Phase-Noise Suppression in Full-Duplex Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633295","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047281/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Canada and the Natural Scicences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Interference Cancellation With Nonlinearity and Phase-Noise Suppression in Full-Duplex Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2754489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134064S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8318405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8318405","articleId":"8047281","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047295,"authors":[{"name":"Dongcai Cheng","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8233431/8047295/cheng-2747599-small.gif","p":["Dongcai Cheng received the B.S. degree in electronic and information\n engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2011.

As the spatial resolution of imaging technology improves, traditional methods struggle to perform well due to the complicated appearance and background distributions. In this paper, we unify the above two tasks into a single framework and apply the deep convolutional neural networks to predict pixelwise label for an input. Specifically, an edge aware convolutional network is proposed to parse a remote sensing harbor image into three typical objects, e.g., sea, land, and ship. Two innovations are made on top of the deep structure. First, we design a multitask model by simultaneously training the segmentation and edge detection networks. Hierarchical semantic features from the segmentation network are extracted to learn the edge network. Second, the outputs of edge pipeline are further employed to refine entire model by adding an edge aware regularization, which helps our method to yield very desirable results that are spatially consistent and well boundary located. It also benefits the segmentation of docked ships that are quite challenging for many previous methods. Experimental results on two datasets collected from Google Earth have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach both in quantitative and qualitative performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2747599","startPage":"5769","endPage":"5783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2747599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233431","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8233431/08047295.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FusionNet: Edge Aware Deep Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Harbor Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047295/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FusionNet: Edge Aware Deep Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Harbor Images","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8047295/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17452359","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 863 projects","grantNumber":"2015AA042307"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91338202, 91438105, 91646207 and 61370039"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4162064"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FusionNet: Edge Aware Deep Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Harbor Images","sourcePdf":"jstars-pt2-cheng-2747599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125345S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8233431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8233431","articleId":"8047295","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":8047296,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

Here, we give new uncertainty relations for a general class of entropies that lead to very close relationships between the original channel and its dual. Moreover, we show that channel duality can be combined with duality of linear codes, whereupon the uncertainty relations imply that the performance of a given code over a given channel is entirely characterized by the performance of the dual code on the dual channel. This has several applications. In the context of polar codes, it implies that the rates of polarization to ideal and useless channels must be identical. Duality also relates the tasks of channel coding and privacy amplification, implying that the finite blocklength performance of extractors and codes is precisely linked, and those optimal rate extractors can be transformed into capacity-achieving codes, and vice versa. Finally, duality also extends to the EXIT function of any channel and code. Here, it implies that for any channel family, if the EXIT function for a fixed code has a sharp transition, then it must be such that the rate of the code equals the capacity at the transition. This gives a different route to proving a code family achieves capacity by establishing sharp EXIT function transitions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2754921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8232491/08047296.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"592","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2754921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Duality of Channels and Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Duality of Channels and Codes","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8047296/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17447779","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation via the National Centre of Competence in Research QSIT"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-16-1-0245"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duality of Channels and Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-renes-2754921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092776S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8232491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8232491","articleId":"8047296","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8047306,"authors":[{"name":"Xinying Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xinying","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0003-2943-9861","id":"37086185387"},{"name":"Lin Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-7369-796X","id":"37292058000"},{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291476200"},{"name":"Yunming Siu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yunming","lastName":"Siu","id":"37282907200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8047306","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":835},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Computational complexity","Message passing","Numerical models","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel coding","computational complexity","error statistics","graph theory","iterative methods","message passing","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["future fifth generation wireless communication systems","message passing algorithm","optimal multiuser detection","low complexity MPA detector","dynamic factor graph","belief values","factor graph model","message propagation","computational complexity","SCMA systems","sparse code multiple access","massive connections","promising nonorthogonal multiple access","DFG-MPA","bit-error-rate","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse code multiple access (SCMA)","message passing algorithm (MPA)","low complexity","dynamic factor graph"]}],"abstract":"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been proposed to support massive connections, and becomes a promising non-orthogonal multiple access in future fifth generation wireless communication systems. In SCMA, message passing algorithm (MPA) is utilized to achieve nearly optimal multiuser detection, but the high complexity of MPA detector still makes it hard to implement in practice. To tackle this issue, we present a low complexity MPA detector based on the dynamic factor graph, named DFG-MPA, in which the branches with large belief values in the factor graph model do not participate in the message propagation in current and later iterations. Moreover, choosing the number of partial branches with large belief values for each iteration adaptively depends on practical application scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed detection scheme provides a commendable tradeoff between bit-error-rate (BER) performance and computational complexity compared with some existing MPA schemes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2752745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08047306.pdf","startPage":"2666","endPage":"2669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2752745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Detection Based on Dynamic Factor Graph for SCMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Detection Based on Dynamic Factor Graph for SCMA Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047306/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17414974","htmlLink":"/document/8047306/","volume":"21","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370012 and 61571082"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program (HIRP)","grantNumber":"YB2015040056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Detection Based on Dynamic Factor Graph for SCMA Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ma-2752745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080429S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8047306","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047307,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jianbin Qiu (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Eng. and\n Ph.D. degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei,\n China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

Generally, in the field of multi-view learning, these algorithms construct informative graph for each view, on which the following clustering or classification procedure are based. However, in many real-world data sets, original data always contain noises and outlying entries that result in unreliable and inaccurate graphs, which cannot be ameliorated in the previous methods. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model which performs clustering/semi-supervised classification and local structure learning simultaneously. The obtained optimal graph can be partitioned into specific clusters directly. Moreover, our model can allocate ideal weight for each view automatically without explicit weight definition and penalty parameters. An efficient algorithm is proposed to optimize this model. Extensive experimental results on different real-world data sets show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-view algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2754939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8167422/08047308.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2754939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-Weighted Multi-View Learning for Image Clustering and Semi-Supervised Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Auto-Weighted Multi-View Learning for Image Clustering and Semi-Supervised Classification","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17446529","pubMedId":"28945592","htmlLink":"/document/8047308/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61761130079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS","grantNumber":"YZDY-SSW-JSC044"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772427"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-Weighted Multi-View Learning for Image Clustering and Semi-Supervised Classification","sourcePdf":"tip-nie-2754939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111428S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8167422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8167422","articleId":"8047308","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8047312,"authors":[{"name":"Shamsul Arafin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/7985001/8047312/arafi-2754583-small.gif","p":["Shamsul Arafin (S\u201908\u2013M\u201912\u2013SM\u201917)\n received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and\n Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in communication technology from Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Ulm,\n Germany, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the Walter Schottky Institut, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen,\n Munich, Germany, in 2012.

The performance of these complex PICs is reaching a stage that can enable a whole new class of applications beyond telecom and datacom. A great deal of effort from both academia and industry has made the significant advances of this technology possible. This development has resulted in a positive and profound impact in many areas including sensing, medical diagnostics, metrology, and consumer photonics. This review paper will mainly discuss the recent, in particular since 2012, progress and findings obtained out of current academic and industry research activities for InP-PICs. Major emphasis will be given to the high-performance and complex PICs that have been reported by the scientific community in this time period. A prospect for further development of this photonic integration in InP-platforms is also briefly described.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2754583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/7985001/08047312.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2754583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7985001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced InP Photonic Integrated Circuits for Communication and Sensing","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/2944/7985001/8047312-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Advanced InP Photonic Integrated Circuits for Communication and Sensing","volume":"24","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17227860","isJournal":true,"externalId":"6100612","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047312/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047312/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DARPA-MTO"},{"fundingName":"DODOS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1402935"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Advanced InP Photonic Integrated Circuits for Communication and Sensing","sourcePdf":"jstqe-arafin-2754583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092725S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"7985001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7985001","articleId":"8047312","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047315,"authors":[{"name":"Shuowen Zhang","affiliation":["NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8047315/szhan-2754486-small.gif","p":["Shuowen Zhang (S\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Chien-Shiung Wu Honors College, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013.

In this paper, we consider a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with CE precoding under frequency-flat fading, and investigate the joint transceiver design by exploiting multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, which has not been addressed in prior work. We consider both single-stream transmission (i.e., beamforming) and multi-stream transmission (i.e., spatial multiplexing). For single-stream transmission, we optimize the receive beamforming vector to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) for any given channel realization and desired constellation at the combiner output. By reformulating the problem as an equivalent quadratically constrained quadratic program, we propose an efficient semi-definite relaxation based algorithm to find an approximate solution. Next, for multi-stream transmission, we propose a new scheme based on antenna grouping at the transmitter and minimum mean squared error or zero-forcing based beamforming at the receiver. The transmit antenna grouping and receive beamforming vectors are then jointly designed to minimize the maximum SER over all data streams. Numerical results show that our proposed schemes for both single- and multi-stream transmissions achieve superior error-rate performances as compared with various benchmark schemes. Finally, the error-rate performances of our proposed single- versus multi-stream transmission schemes are compared via simulations under different setups, which provide useful insights to the transmission mode selection for CE-precoded MIMO systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519948","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047315/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constant Envelope Precoding for MIMO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant Envelope Precoding for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhang-2754486-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148918S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8047315","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047320,"authors":[{"name":"Wenguan Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wenguan Wang received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science.

It addresses two important issues: 1) deep video saliency model training with the absence of sufficiently large and pixel-wise annotated video data and 2) fast video saliency training and detection. The proposed deep video saliency network consists of two modules, for capturing the spatial and temporal saliency information, respectively. The dynamic saliency model, explicitly incorporating saliency estimates from the static saliency model, directly produces spatiotemporal saliency inference without time-consuming optical flow computation. We further propose a novel data augmentation technique that simulates video training data from existing annotated image data sets, which enables our network to learn diverse saliency information and prevents overfitting with the limited number of training videos. Leveraging our synthetic video data (150K video sequences) and real videos, our deep video saliency model successfully learns both spatial and temporal saliency cues, thus producing accurate spatiotemporal saliency estimate. We advance the state-of-the-art on the densely annotated video segmentation data set (MAE of .06) and the Freiburg-Berkeley Motion Segmentation data set (MAE of .07), and do so with much improved speed (2 fps with all steps).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"27","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17260119","pubMedId":"28945593","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047320/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Video Salient Object Detection via Fully Convolutional Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB328805"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272359"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002888","fundingName":"Joint Building Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Salient Object Detection via Fully Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-shen-2754941-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16156S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8047320","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047321,"authors":[{"name":"Hou-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hou-Ming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-0638-5426","id":"38547150800"},{"name":"Hsien-Chi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsien-Chi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086495620"},{"name":"Shih-Han Jheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Han","lastName":"Jheng","id":"37085845245"},{"name":"Han-Ting Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Han-Ting","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086495613"},{"name":"Yu-Siang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Siang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086497061"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8047321","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1391},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Logic gates","Transistors","Hysteresis","Switching loss","Switching circuits","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","comparators (circuits)","logic gates","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZCD design","logic gate","discontinuous conduction mode","TSMC 1P6M CMOS technology","reverse current elimination","maximum power efficiency","energy storage period","energy release period","high-side switch","hysteresis comparators","integrated pulse-frequency modulation boost converter","accurate zero current detector","high-efficiency PFM boost converter","current 50.0 mA","current 1.0 mA","size 0.18 mum","size 0.43 mm","efficiency 28.29 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)","pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) boost converter","power efficiency","reverse current","zero current detector (ZCD)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047321","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08047321.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754514","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2754514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency PFM Boost Converter With an Accurate Zero Current Detector","abstract":"In this brief, an integrated pulse-frequency modulation boost converter with an accurate zero current detector (ZCD) is presented.

With the proposed channel equalization method, it was demonstrated that the ISIs were successfully removed with a significantly improved eye-opening and timing margin.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047324/","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8047324/","accessionNumber":"17485559","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Passive Equalizer Optimization Method Based on Time-Domain Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) Cancellation Technique","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"R&D Program of the Korea Railroad Research Institute, Republic of Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Passive Equalizer Optimization Method Based on Time-Domain Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) Cancellation Technique","sourcePdf":"temc-song-2749519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042775S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"8248570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8248570","articleId":"8047324","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8047325,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Holmes","affiliation":["School of Computing, Mathematics, and Digital Technology, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, Greater Manchester, GB"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/8328987/8047325/holme-2754497-small.gif","p":["\n               Mike Holmes received the BSc degree in computing from Manchester\n Metropolitan University (MMU) in 2012.

Human tutors recognize comprehension and non-comprehension states by interpreting learner non-verbal behavior (NVB). Experienced tutors adapt pedagogy, materials, and instruction to provide additional learning scaffold in the context of perceived learner comprehension. Near real-time assessment for e-learner comprehension of on-screen information could provide a powerful tool for both adaptation within intelligent e-learning platforms and appraisal of tutorial content for learning analytics. However, literature suggests that no existing method for automatic classification of learner comprehension by analysis of NVB can provide a practical solution in an e-learning, on-screen, context. This paper presents design, development, and evaluation of COMPASS, a novel near real-time comprehension classification system for use in detecting learner comprehension of on-screen information during e-learning activities. COMPASS uses a novel descriptive analysis of learner behavior, image processing techniques, and artificial neural networks to model and classify authentic comprehension indicative non-verbal behavior. This paper presents a study in which 44 undergraduate students answered on-screen multiple choice questions relating to computer programming. Using a front-facing USB web camera the behavior of the learner is recorded during reading and appraisal of on-screen information. The resultant dataset of non-verbal behavior and question-answer scores has been used to train artificial neural network (ANN) to classify comprehension and non-comprehension states in near real-time. The trained comprehension classifier achieved normalized classification accuracy of 75.8 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17683758","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8047325/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Near Real-Time Comprehension Classification with Artificial Neural Networks: Decoding e-Learner Non-Verbal Behavior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near Real-Time Comprehension Classification with Artificial Neural Networks: Decoding e-Learner Non-Verbal Behavior","sourcePdf":"tlt-holmes-2754497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121634S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"8328987","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8328987","articleId":"8047325","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8047326,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8290782/8047326/fan-2754960-small.gif","p":["Qiang Fan received the B.S. degree from Suzhou University of Science\n and Technology, Suzhou, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yunnan University of\n Nationalities, Kunming, China, in 2013.

Ground-to-train free space optical (FSO) communications suffer from frequent handovers due to high mobility of HSTs, thus shortening the connection time between the train and ground, and greatly impacting passengers' user experience. To provision high-speed Internet services in HSTs, we propose the rotating transceiver scheme to mitigate the impact of handover processes with steerable FSO transceivers in a ground-to-train communications system. Owing to the rotating feature of the scheme, the on-roof transceiver of a train can maintain a reliable link with a base station (BS) for a longer time, and remarkably reduce the number of handover processes, thus provisioning higher data rates of the system. Meanwhile, since the separation distances between BSs are extended, the total number of BSs required to be deployed along the track is also reduced, thus reducing the deployment cost for service providers. Moreover, a new handover method is designed to mitigate the impact of each handover delay, especially on live streaming applications. Finally, the performance improvement of the proposed scheme over the existing fixed transceiver one is demonstrated via simulation results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08047326.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2754960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2754960","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Impact of Handovers in Ground-to-Train Free Space Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047326/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Impact of Handovers in Ground-to-Train Free Space Optical Communications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047326/","volume":"67","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17577920","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Impact of Handovers in Ground-to-Train Free Space Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-fan-2754960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126036S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8047326","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8047328,"authors":[{"name":"Hongcai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8340241/8047328/zhang-2754940-small.gif","p":["Hongcai Zhang (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical\n engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree\n in electrical engineering.","He is also currently working as an exchange student researcher in the Energy, Controls, and Applications Lab,\n University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.

Based on the design of a hybrid breaker, the MLB is an economically attractive solution for the protection of multiple dc lines in nodal connection using a single main breaker path. By using commutation units, the MLB directs the fault current through the main breaker in a unidirectional way, irrespective of the fault location. Hence, this study presents the design requirements for the MLB, regarding both hardware and control, and evaluates its operation within a grid. For this reason, a four-terminal half-bridge multilevel modular converters-based MTdc grid in radial configuration was used and pole-to-ground dc fault conditions were investigated. The dc fault response of the grid with one MLB at the central node is compared to the respective response of the grid when one hybrid breaker is employed at each dc line. The simulations show that the MLB is feasible and that the overall MTdc grid fault response for the two protection systems is very similar. As a result, the design advantages of the MLB make it a promising solution for the dc fault isolation in MTdc grids.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2754649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/8332909/08047329.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2017.2754649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiline Breaker for HVdc Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047329/","displayDocTitle":"Multiline Breaker for HVdc Applications","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17683638","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047329/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiline Breaker for HVdc Applications","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-kontos-2754649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082008S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"8332909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8332909","articleId":"8047329","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047332,"authors":[{"name":"Jienan Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8290782/8047332/chen-2754552-small.gif","p":["Jienan Chen (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in communication systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu,\n China, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications,\n UESTC.

The sparse code multiple access (SCMA) technology has been proposed for the 5G communication systems to supply stronger connectivity with limited resources. However, a low-complexity decoding algorithm is required by the SCMA decoder for the high computation complexity of decoding nonorthogonal signals. In this paper, we propose a high-performance and low-cost decoding algorithm based on a Bayesian program learning method, Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). We also propose a new MCMC sampling method to generate samples from a joint update parallel (JUP) MCMC sampler. The simulation results show that the JUP-based MCMC SCMA decoder can save 60% computation complexity compared to the existing decoding method with a codebook size 16, which only has 0.5-dB performance loss compared to the maximum-likelihood-like decoding algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8290782/08047332.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2754552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2754552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Update Parallel MCMC-Method-Based Sparse Code Multiple Access Decoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Maximum likelihood decoding","5G mobile communication","Bit error rate","Monte Carlo methods","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Bayes methods","Markov processes","maximum likelihood decoding","Monte Carlo methods","multi-access systems","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse code multiple access decoder","5G communication systems","Bayesian program learning method","Monte Carlo Markov Chain","MCMC sampling method","MCMC SCMA decoder","maximum-likelihood-like decoding algorithm","multiple access techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)","non-orthogonal multiple access","resource-constrained networks","sparse code multiple access (SCMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Update Parallel MCMC-Method-Based Sparse Code Multiple Access Decoder","volume":"67","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8047332/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17577924","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501084"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Update Parallel MCMC-Method-Based Sparse Code Multiple Access Decoder","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2754552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096871S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8047332","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047333,"authors":[{"name":"Zoubeir Mlika","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Zoubeir","lastName":"Mlika","orcid":"0000-0003-3417-7704","id":"38542664300"},{"name":"Elmahdi Driouch","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Elmahdi","lastName":"Driouch","id":"37304160800"},{"name":"Wessam Ajib","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Wessam","lastName":"Ajib","orcid":"0000-0003-4409-9447","id":"37294527900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8047333","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Interference","Cellular networks","Optimized production technology","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","computational complexity","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard deadlines","heterogeneous cellular networks","user association","scheduling","NP-hard problem","close-to-optimal algorithm","constant-factor approximation algorithm","optimal algorithm","deadline constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation algorithm","base station association","heterogeneous cellular networks","NP-hard","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"This letter studies the problem of user association and scheduling in heterogeneous cellular networks under deadline constraints.

Finally, we show via simulations that the proposed algorithm performs close-to-optimal and surpasses benchmark heuristic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2752714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2752714","startPage":"2698","endPage":"2701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08047333.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Association and Scheduling With Hard Deadlines in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"User Association and Scheduling With Hard Deadlines in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17414954","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047333/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Association and Scheduling With Hard Deadlines in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mlika-2752714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077698S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8047333","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047335,"authors":[{"name":"Feiran Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8047335/zhao-2754488-small.gif","p":["Feiran Zhao (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, China, in 2015.

Employing the time splitting protocol, the energy constrained source S first harvests energy through the radio-frequency signals sent by the PB and then uses this energy to transmit information to the destination D. Unlike several prior works, we assume that the energy transfer link is subjected to Rician fading, which is a real fading environment, due to relatively short range power transfer distance and the existence of a strong line of sight path. We present a comprehensive analysis of the achievable ergodic capacity in two scenarios, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at PB, namely, the absence of CSI and partial CSI. For the former case, equal power allocation is used, while for the later one, energy beamforming is used to enhance the energy transfer efficiency. For both the cases, closed-form expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the ergodic capacity are derived. Furthermore, the optimal time split is discussed, and the capacity in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes is studied through simple closed-form expressions. Numerical results and simulations are provided to validate the theoretical analysis. The results show that the Rician factor K has a significant impact on the ergodic capacity performance, and this impact strongly depends on the availability of the CSI at the PB.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754488","startPage":"404","endPage":"417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08047335.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of Wireless Powered Communication Systems Over Rician Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of Wireless Powered Communication Systems Over Rician Fading Channels","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17519943","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671406"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR15F010001"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001002-003"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education and Science of Macedonia","grantNumber":"16-4644"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of Wireless Powered Communication Systems Over Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhong-2754488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083807S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8047335","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047336,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information Systems (IRAIS), College of Computer and Control Engineering, and also with the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics (tjKLIR), Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8306207/8047336/sun-2754540-small.gif","p":["Ning Sun (S\u201912$-$\nM\u201914) received the B.S.

As a typical nonlinear underactuated system, a boom crane presents complicated dynamical characteristics mainly due to its complex multidimensional movements like rotational motions, pitching motions, as well as payload swings, which brings much difficulty for controller design. In this paper, a new nonlinear controller is proposed for underactuated boom cranes. Specifically, the presented control scheme can achieve 2-D rotary positioning and 2-D swing suppression simultaneously, with an additional coupling term as well as an overshoot-limiting term being incorporated to increase the transient performance. Consequently, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point is proven by utilizing Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first closed-loop control method to solve the positioning and anti-oscillation problem for 3-D boom cranes without needing to linearize the original nonlinear dynamics for controller design or analysis, which is of great significance. Finally, hardware experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control method.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2754540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8306207/08047336.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2754540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Motion Control of Underactuated Three-Dimensional Boom Cranes With Hardware Experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047336/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Motion Control of Underactuated Three-Dimensional Boom Cranes With Hardware Experiments","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600186","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047336/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"15JCQNJC03800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600186 and 2017T100153"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Motion Control of Underactuated Three-Dimensional Boom Cranes With Hardware Experiments","sourcePdf":"tii-sun-2754540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138719S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8306207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8306207","articleId":"8047336","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047337,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8047337/xu-2754483-small.gif","p":["Lei Xu received the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information system from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2006, 2009, and 2012, respectively.

The joint power and bandwidth allocation with multiple services is subject to constraints in system available bandwidth, proportional fairness transmission rate for non-real-time secondary mobile terminals (MTs), minimum required transmission rate for real-time secondary MTs, interference power for primary base station, and total power consumption for each secondary MT. The joint power and bandwidth allocation problem with multiple services based on risk-return model is formulated as a bargaining game framework, first. Then, an optimal power and bandwidth allocation algorithm utilizing a dual decomposition method is proposed to obtain Nash bargaining solution. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the optimal and heuristic algorithms not only improve the spectrum efficiency, but also guarantee the fairness for secondary MTs with non-real-time service.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2754483","startPage":"394","endPage":"403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

To properly operate the proposed 2P3L ETSM, 4 pulse width modulatiop (PWM) signals with a 90\u00b0 phase shift from each PWM signal are required without any mismatch between duty cycles. To remove the mismatch, a time-division multiplexing comparator and a duty-cycle calibrator are proposed. Thanks to the proposed techniques, the proposed ETSM fabricated in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS achieved the highest peak dynamic efficiency of 88.6% with an LTE20 signal, which is superior to the state-of-the-art systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2754651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2754651","startPage":"2815","endPage":"2819","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8248674/08047343.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8248674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-Phase 3-Level ETSM With Mismatch-Free Duty Cycles Achieving 88.6% Peak Efficiency for a 20-MHz LTE RF Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"2-Phase 3-Level ETSM With Mismatch-Free Duty Cycles Achieving 88.6% Peak Efficiency for a 20-MHz LTE RF Power Amplifier","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2018","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047343/","accessionNumber":"17485746","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047343/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SAMSUNG ELECTRO-MECHANICS-KAIST MRFC center"},{"fundingName":"Sookmyung Women's University Research","grantNumber":"1-1703-2037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-Phase 3-Level ETSM With Mismatch-Free Duty Cycles Achieving 88.6% Peak Efficiency for a 20-MHz LTE RF Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-hong-2754651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071811S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8248674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8248674","articleId":"8047343","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8047358,"authors":[{"name":"Ralf Kneuper","affiliation":["International University of Applied Sciences (IUBH)"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/85/8047350/8047358/8047358-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ralf Kneuper earned a Diploma in Mathematics at the University of Bonn, Germany (1985), and then a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, United Kingdom (1989).

This technique starts with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is known to be nonconvex. A semidefinite programming technique to effectively transform the MLE problem into a convex optimization is proposed, together with a unified solution for four scenarios: 1) without a calibration emitter; 2) with a single calibration emitter, whose position is subject to measurement errors; 3) with a single calibration emitter, whose position is perfectly known; and 4) with a single calibration emitter, whose position is completely unknown. The results are finally extended to the case of multiple calibration emitters, whose positions are also subject to errors. Similar to the existing schemes that are known to have good performances, the proposed solution also reaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound when sensor position errors and TDOA measurement noise are sufficiently small. However, as TDOA measurement noise or sensor position errors increase, comparison with the existing state-of-the-art methods for each scenario shows that the proposed solution performs significantly better.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047437.pdf","startPage":"23111","endPage":"23120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semidefinite Programming Methods for Alleviating Sensor Position Error in TDOA Localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047437/","displayDocTitle":"Semidefinite Programming Methods for Alleviating Sensor Position Error in TDOA Localization","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17381105","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047437/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1533125 and 61771108"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001022"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015Z011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Semidefinite Programming Methods for Alleviating Sensor Position Error in TDOA Localization","sourcePdf":"access-wan-2752206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079498S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047437","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047439,"authors":[{"name":"Xuqiang Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8081776/8047439/zheng-2746672-small.gif","p":["Xuqiang Zheng received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Physics and Electronics, Central South University, Hunan, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.

The TX implements a quarter-rate multi-multiplexer (MUX)-based four-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), where a charge-sharing-effect elimination technique is introduced into the 4:1 MUX to optimize its jitter performance and power efficiency. The RX employs a two-stage continuous-time linear equalizer as the analog front end and integrates a low-cost sign-based zero-forcing engine relying on edge-data correlation to automatically adjust the tap weights of the TX-FFE. By embedding low-pass filters with an adaptively adjusting bandwidth into the data-sampling path and adopting high-linearity compensating phase interpolators, the clock data recovery achieves both high jitter tolerance and low jitter generation. The fabricated TX and RX chipset delivers 40-Gb/s PRBS data at BER <; 10-12 over a channel with >16-dB loss at half-baud frequency, while consuming a total power of 370 mW.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"52","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17284285","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047439/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 40-Gb/s Quarter-Rate SerDes Transmitter and Receiver Chipset in 65-nm CMOS","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China 863 Program","grantNumber":"2013AA014302"},{"fundingName":"European FP7-LIVCODE","grantNumber":"295151"},{"fundingName":"HAZCEPT","grantNumber":"318907"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40-Gb/s Quarter-Rate SerDes Transmitter and Receiver Chipset in 65-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-zheng-2746672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103776S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8081776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8081776","articleId":"8047439","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047443,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen Rust","affiliation":["Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8119588/8047443/rust-2748380-small.gif","p":["Jochen Rust received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of Hanover in 2007, and the Doctoral degree from the Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics in 2014.

However, its impact on high performance QR decomposition (QRD) has only been roughly studied so far. In this paper, a novel hardware architecture for Givens-Rotation-based QRD is proposed targeting hardware efficient signal processing. To this end, an ingenious triangular systolic array structure is considered. Complex-valued matrices are efficiently processed by means of a sophisticated bivariate numeric function approximation methodology. In order to get a comprehensive insight in the performance, exhaustive evaluation is carried out with a modern multi-antenna wireless communication system. In detail, the proposed QRD hardware architecture is used in a suitable channel pre-coding setup. For a meaningful proof-of-concept, our work is evaluated on several levels of the computing stack. In addition, our design is implemented and physically synthesized in a state-of-the-art 65-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company technology and compared with other publications. The results indicate our approach to be a powerful solution for hardware-based QRD, especially in terms of energy and area requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and

Specifically, the central unit (CU) in the CRANs distributes data to a set of radio units (RUs) powered by both on-grid energy and energy harvested from green sources, and allocates channels to the selected RUs for downlink transmissions. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the net gain of the system which is the difference between the user utility gain and on-grid energy costs, taking into consideration the stochastic nature of energy harvesting process, time-varying on-grid energy price, and dynamic wireless channel conditions. A resource allocation framework is developed to decompose the formulated problem into three subproblems, i.e., the hybrid energy management, data requesting, and channel and power allocation. Based on the solutions of the subproblems, we propose a net gain-optimal resource allocation (GRA) algorithm to maximize the net gain while stabilizing the data buffers and ensuring the sustainability of batteries. Performance analysis demonstrates that the GRA algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal net gain with bounded data buffer and battery capacity. Extensive simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate that GRA algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of the net gain and delay performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","volume":"67","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17577955","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047453/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Green Cloud Radio Access Networks With Hybrid Energy Supplies","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61702561, 61702562 and 61379057"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1554576"},{"fundingName":"Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University","grantNumber":"2016CXS013"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2013DFB10070"},{"fundingName":"China Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2012GK4106"},{"fundingName":"Research Project of the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, China","grantNumber":"ICT170318"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Green Cloud Radio Access Networks With Hybrid Energy Supplies","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2754273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142308S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8290782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8290782","articleId":"8047453","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8047477,"authors":[{"name":"Huaxin Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/9034462/8047477/li-2754249-small.gif","p":["Huaxin Li received the BSc degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2011.

In this paper, we propose a Novel Heterogeneous De-anonymization Scheme (NHDS) aiming at de-anonymizing heterogeneous social networks. NHDS first leverages the network graph structure to significantly reduce the size of candidate set, then exploits user profile information to identify the correct mapping users with a high confidence. Performance evaluation on real-world social network datasets shows that NHDS significantly outperforms the prior schemes. Finally, we perform an empirical study on privacy leakage arising from cross-network aggregation based on four real-world social network datasets. Our findings show that 39.9 percent more information is disclosed through de-anonymization and the de-anonymized ratio is 84 percent. The detailed privacy leakage of user demographics and interests is also examined, which demonstrates the practicality of the identified privacy leakage issue.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","volume":"17","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"19450057","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2020","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8047477/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy Leakage via De-Anonymization and Aggregation in Heterogeneous Social Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1401253, 61672350, U1405251 and 71671114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012164","fundingName":"National High-tech Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2015AA01A707"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy Leakage via De-Anonymization and Aggregation in Heterogeneous Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tdsc-zhu-2754249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247857S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9034462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"9034462","articleId":"8047477","onlineDate":"20 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047580,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Huang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086145123"},{"name":"Honglun Wang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Honglun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899361200"},{"name":"Na Li","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Aircraft Control Laboratory, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Li","id":"37086173240"},{"name":"Yue Yu","affiliation":["Unmanned System Research Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086142901"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3021-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3023-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8047580","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Aircraft propulsion","Solar radiation","Sun","Aerospace electronics","Urban areas","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","energy harvesting","mobile robots","remotely operated vehicles","solar powered vehicles","sunlight"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["total energy","SUAV","energy harvesting model","clear sky solar irradiance","energy consumption","endurance estimation","perpetual endurance window","graphical method","endurance estimate","solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles","calculating endurance","solarpowered airplane","approximate endurance","energy balance","cruise endurance","steady-state flight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar-powered Unmanned Air Vehicle (SUAV)","energy balance","solar irradiance","graphical method"]}],"abstract":"Calculating endurance is very important for solarpowered airplane, both with respect to aircraft designs and mission planning. This paper presents a graphical method to evaluate the approximate endurance of solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAV). The method, which is based on the principle of energy balance, is established in this study. According to the principle, cruise endurance is considered as a steady-state flight where the effects of date and location are taken into account, but other effects (acceleration or flight path inclination) are neglected. Firstly, to predict the total energy of SUAV, an energy harvesting model, based on clear sky solar irradiance, is introduced. Subsequently, the expression used to calculate the energy consumption for SUAV in level flight is shown. After that, the process of endurance estimation is described. And then, to describe the endurance of SUAV, the perpetual endurance window is introduced. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented, and simulation results demonstrate the graphical method is a feasible and flexible tool to estimate endurance of SUAV.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2017.22","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8046763/8047557/08047580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2017.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047557","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Endurance Estimate for Solar-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Endurance Estimate for Solar-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047580/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17207444","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047580/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Endurance Estimate for Solar-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3022a066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058153S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8046763","isNumber":"8047557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046763","xplore-issue":"8047557","articleId":"8047580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8047601,"authors":[{"name":"Yutian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Yutian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087072019"},{"name":"Xiaolong He","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Mobile Communication, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"He","id":"37087072060"},{"name":"Hang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086025883"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3021-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3023-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8047601","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Man-machine systems","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","impedance matching","microwave antennas","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","slot antennas","ultra wideband antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sharply-notched bands","low mutual coupling","UWB systems","in-band interference","compact two-port UWB-MIMO slot antenna","two-element UWB-MIMO step slot antenna","compact size","rectangular slots","ground plane","impedance matching","open-ended quarter-wavelength split slots","radiating slots","C-band","WLAN frequency band","operating band","ECC","frequency notches","dual band notched characteristic","UWB range","frequency 7.0 GHz","noise figure -18.0 dB","frequency 3.0 GHz to 4.0 GHz","frequency 3.07 GHz to 11.09 GHz","frequency 3.71 GHz to 4.38 GHz","frequency 5.16 GHz to 5.9 GHz","size 23 mm","size 21 mm","size 0.8 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB-MIMO","isolation enhancement","compact size","dual band-rejection"]}],"abstract":"A dual band-notched two-element UWB-MIMO step slot antenna with a very compact size of 23\u00a1\u00c121\u00a1\u00c10.8 mm3 is presented.

By means of radio simulations, we define a 5G radio deployment scenario for FWA that can meet the service requirements of future fixed broadband access. Different transport requirements imposed by different radio access network (RAN) split options are considered and a broad range of optical transport technologies/systems to support the FWA scenario is analyzed. For higher-layer RAN split options, we find that conventional 10G passive optical networks (XG-PONs) and coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM) technologies are the most cost effective. CWDM provides improved support for low-latency services while XG-PON facilitates future migration to fiber to the home. For lower-layer RAN splits, point-to-point (PtP) fiber or PtP-WDM is required. In the considered scenario, CWDM and PtP technologies are found to be the most cost effective.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical transport solutions for 5G fixed wireless access [Invited]","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000D10","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8047489/08047675.pdf","startPage":"D10","endPage":"D18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000D10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047675/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optical transport solutions for 5G fixed wireless access [Invited]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17192572","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical transport solutions for 5G fixed wireless access [Invited]","sourcePdf":"06D10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028201S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","isNumber":"8047489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"10","articleId":"8047675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8047676,"authors":[{"name":"Rodolfo Alvizu","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Alvizu"},{"name":"Sebastian Troia","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Troia"},{"name":"Guido Maier","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Maier"},{"name":"Achille Pattavina","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Achille","lastName":"Pattavina"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8047676","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":756},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Mobile communication","Planning","Mobile computing","Prediction algorithms","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","learning (artificial intelligence)","linear programming","mobile radio","optical communication equipment","software defined networking","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical wavelength assignment optimization problem","optical routing assignment optimization problem","off-line mixed-integer linear programming","tidal traffic variation prediction","software-defined mobile carrier network","spatiotemporal fluctuations","public transportation","mobile phones","software-defined mobile metro-core networks","machine-learning-based prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Dynamic optical routing","Energy efficiency","Machine learning","Mobile metro-core network","Network optimization","Prediction","Software-defined networking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047676","abstract":"In general, humans follow a routine with highly predictable daily movements. For instance, we commute from home to work on a daily basis and visit a selected set of places for commercial and recreational purposes during the nights and weekends. The use of mobile phones increases when commuting via public transportation, during lunch breaks, and at night. Such regular behavior creates predictable spatiotemporal fluctuations of traffic patterns. In this paper, we introduce a matheuristic for dynamic optical routing, which can be implemented as an application into a software-defined mobile carrier network. We use machine learning to predict tidal traffic variations in a mobile metro-core network, which allows us to solve off-line mixed-integer linear programming instances of an optical routing (and wavelength) assignment optimization problem. The optimal results are used to favor near-optimal on-line routing decisions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our on-line methodology, with results that match almost perfectly the behavior of a network that performs optical routing reconfiguration with a perfect, oracle-like traffic prediction and the solution of an optimization problem.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000D19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000D19","startPage":"D19","endPage":"D30","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8047489/08047676.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matheuristic with machine-learning-based prediction for software-defined mobile metro-core networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Matheuristic with machine-learning-based prediction for software-defined mobile metro-core networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17192578","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047676/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matheuristic with machine-learning-based prediction for software-defined mobile metro-core networks","sourcePdf":"07D19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022756S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","isNumber":"8047489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"25","articleId":"8047676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8047677,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Wen-De Zhong","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Wen-De","lastName":"Zhong"},{"name":"Dehao Wu","affiliation":["The University of Manchester, Manchester, Manchester, GB"],"firstName":"Dehao","lastName":"Wu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8047677","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":806},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Optical receivers","Optical imaging","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","free-space optical communication","indoor communication","light emitting diodes","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","optical images","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output visible light communications","high-data-rate indoor wireless communications","white light-emitting diodes","illumination functions","nonHermitian symmetry orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation scheme","angle diversity receiver imaging","analytical bit error rate expression","indoor imaging MIMO-VLC system based NHS-OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coverage","Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Visible light communication (VLC)"]}],"abstract":"Visible light communication (VLC) using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has great potential for future high-data-rate indoor wireless communications.

High data rate capabilities and ultra-dense access point deployment will allow OWC to supplement traditional RF technologies and remove congestion from the crowded RF spectrum. When implementing OWC via intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD), peak optical power emission constrains the instantaneous optical power. Average optical power is also constrained by eye safety regulations and illumination requirements of infrared and visible light communication (VLC) systems, respectively. These constraints differ from the conventional electrical power constraint of RF and wireline systems. Accordingly, performance metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) have been redefined in relation to the optical channel constraints in order to provide fair comparison across OWC implementations. In densely deployed networks, interference has a significant effect on system performance. Two key properties simplify the analysis of RF networks: 1) the relationship between electrical power and interference variance is modulation agnostic and 2) many interferers are typically assumed. The former allows SINR to be defined in terms of the channel constraint and the latter allows the aggregate disturbance from interference-plus-noise to be modeled as an additive Gaussian random component. In OWC networks, the optical power constraints relate to interference variance in a modulation specific manner, and the highly directional optical channel creates instances where a small set of interferers dominate the aggregate disturbance. In this work, we first derive bounds on the variance of OWC interference under the constraints of an OWC channel. We then evaluate the accuracy of assuming that interference follows a Gaussian distribution. Finally, we show results of a study in a testbed environment with 15 VLC-enabled LED luminaires in order to empirically evaluate OWC interference characteristics.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000D51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000D51","startPage":"D51","endPage":"D63","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8047489/08047679.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference in IM/DD optical wireless communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Interference in IM/DD optical wireless communication networks","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17192569","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference in IM/DD optical wireless communication networks","sourcePdf":"10D51.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045414S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","isNumber":"8047489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"12","articleId":"8047679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047681,"authors":[{"name":"Elaine Wong","affiliation":["The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Wong"},{"name":"Elena Grigoreva","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Grigoreva"},{"name":"Lena Wosinska","affiliation":["Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan Institutionen for Data- och Systemvetenskap, Kista, SE"],"firstName":"Lena","lastName":"Wosinska"},{"name":"Carmen Mas Machuca","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Carmen Mas","lastName":"Machuca"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8047681","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":753},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Optical network units","Wavelength division multiplexing","Mobile computing","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel capacity","energy consumption","optical fibre networks","optical transceivers","synchronisation","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["survivability","power savings","5G transport networks","fifth generation transport networks","DWDM rings","dense wavelength division multiplexing","information sharing","flexible speedy efficient unlimited data delivery","reliability","latency","synchronization","security","energy consumption","mobile base stations","remote radio units","RRU fronthaul network","BS backhaul network","network resources","energy efficiency","sleep mode operation","mobile transport networks","optical ring transport network","transceivers","network energy savings","brownfield","duct reuse","greenfield deployments","mobile network operators","network capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G transport networks","Network protection and restoration","Network survivability","Reflective monitoring","Wavelength division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"So much has been promised by the fifth generation (5G), the revolution of mobile communications that allows for flexible, speedy, and efficient delivery of unlimited data and information sharing between people located anywhere and at any time. The road toward making 5G a reality, however, requires concerted efforts in designing both the underlying infrastructure and the enabling technologies to simultaneously satisfy not only capacity but also reliability, low latency, synchronization, security, and energy consumption requirements. In that respect, the transport segment of a 5G network, i.e., the backhaul network of mobile base stations (BSs) or fronthaul of remote radio units (RRUs), must not be overlooked. Further, any future design of a resilient 5G transport network must also consider the potential exploitation of switching on and off network resources such as RRUs and BSs to improve energy efficiency. At present, there are few inroads on 5G transport networks that provide resilience during sleep mode operation. Therefore, the focus of this work is aimed specifically at providing solutions to enhance both the survivability and power savings of mobile transport networks that implement sleep mode operation. We develop our solutions around a dense wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical ring transport network that has been previously proven to be energy efficient as a 5G transport network. Further, we propose two survivable schemes that exploit the inherent resiliency of the ring network. In conjunction with cw monitoring signals and highly sensitive monitoring modules, these schemes facilitate for the first time continuous monitoring of the network at all times, even during idle periods of transmission when transceivers are sleeping. That is, our proposed schemes enable network energy savings through sleep mode operation without having to compromise on failure detection time. Compared to a conventional ring architecture, our survivable schemes provide enhanced connection availability and power savings at less than 0.2% incremental network cost. Based on performance evaluations for brownfield, duct reuse, and greenfield deployments, we provide guidance on the most suitable scheme for each considered scenario, thus driving the future choices of mobile network operators.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000D74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000D74","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8047489/08047681.pdf","startPage":"D74","endPage":"D85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the survivability and power savings of 5G transport networks based on DWDM rings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the survivability and power savings of 5G transport networks based on DWDM rings","volume":"9","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17192576","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047681/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the survivability and power savings of 5G transport networks based on DWDM rings","sourcePdf":"12D74.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04486S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","isNumber":"8047489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"7","articleId":"8047681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047685,"authors":[{"name":"You-Wei Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"You-Wei","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Yu-Chieh Chi","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Yu-Chieh","lastName":"Chi"},{"name":"Huai-Yung Wang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Huai-Yung","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Cheng-Ting Tsai","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ting","lastName":"Tsai"},{"name":"Zu-Kai Weng","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Zu-Kai","lastName":"Weng"},{"name":"Kai-Ming Feng","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Kai-Ming","lastName":"Feng"},{"name":"Gong-Ru Lin","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Gong-Ru","lastName":"Lin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8047685","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"abstract":"By using a widely wavelength lockable Fabry-Perot laser diode (FPLD) with low facet reflectance under intensity modulation and direct detection, a multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) enhanced long-reach passive optical network (LR-PON) architecture is demonstrated to perform the dense-spectral-utilized transmission with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) format. Enlarging the power injected into the low-facet-reflectance FPLD enables the broadening of operational wavelength margins at a cost of slightly increased bit-error rate (BER). After LR-PON transmission, the signal-to-noise ratio among subcarriers strongly correlates with the frequency chirp of the wavelength-locked FPLD, which affects the allowable wavelength locking range. By substituting MC-CDMA for the typical OFDM format and using the minimum-mean-squared-error-based multicode interference cancellation processing, the BER degradation is minimized, accompanied by a 16% extension on the lockable wavelength margin achieved under 3 dBm injection. Such a widely wavelength lockable FPLD-based MC-CDMA enhances the LR-PON with a power penalty reduction of 1 dB as compared to the typical OFDM LR-PON after 60 km transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8047489/08047685.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"755","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.9.000747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.9.000747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MC-CDMA enhanced LR-PON using widely wavelength lockable FPLD with low facet reflectance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Digital signal processing","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Reflectivity","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","Fabry-Perot resonators","intensity modulation","laser noise","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","optical communication equipment","passive optical networks","reflectivity","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intensity modulation and direct detection","multicarrier code division multiple access","MC-CDMA enhanced long-reach passive optical network architecture","dense-spectral-utilized transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing format","low-facet-reflectance FPLD","bit-error rate","signal-to-noise ratio","minimum-mean-squared-error-based multicode interference cancellation processing","widely wavelength lockable FPLD-based MC-CDMA","Fabry-Perot laser diode","power penalty reduction","distance 60 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fabry-Perot laser diode (FPLD)","Injection locking","Long reach","Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA)","Passive optical network (PON)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"MC-CDMA enhanced LR-PON using widely wavelength lockable FPLD with low facet reflectance","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17192577","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MC-CDMA enhanced LR-PON using widely wavelength lockable FPLD with low facet reflectance","sourcePdf":"16747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031488S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","isNumber":"8047489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8047685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8047791,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chang\u00e9","affiliation":["Princeton Vision, Potomac, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Chang\u00e9","id":"37087839852"},{"name":"Christoph Mertz","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Mertz","id":"37666676000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0437-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0438-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8047791","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Robot sensing systems","Monte Carlo methods","Noise measurement","Measurement by laser beam","Laser modes","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","driver information systems","Kalman filters","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imminent collision detection algorithm","assistance systems","Imminent collision detection systems","low false alarm rate","Monte Carlo sampling framework","laser scanner based prototype system","collision detection approaches","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["collision avoidance","Monte Carlo method","noise distribution","sampling method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047791","abstract":"Imminent collision detection is an important problem for automotive safety, and is critical for driving assistance systems and fully autonomous vehicles.

Image recognition is a traditional way for pavement crack detected. Recently, deep learning is a state-of-the-art method for target detection. CNN (convolutional neural network), a significant method in deep learning, is widely used in image target detection and brings about breakthroughs. However, CNN has not been applied to pavement crack detection. In this paper, we apply CNN to detect pavement crack and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to classify the detected pavement cracks. Firstly, two databases are obtained by using two different scales of grid (32\u00d732, 64\u00d764) to segment pavement images. Each database has 30000 images for training set. We obtain two kinds of trained CNN. Each CNN is trained by one training set, which is part of each scale databases. We use trained CNN to detect the existence of pavement crack in corresponding scale grids. We confirm the scale of segment grid by comparing the results of pavement crack detected. Secondly, we only keep the grids containing crack and achieve the skeleton of crack in a pavement image. Lastly, we use PCA to analyse the skeleton of crack. The classification of crack can be obtained. The F-measure for crack detection is 94.7%. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves 97.2%, 97.6% and 90.1% correct rate of classification for longitudinal crack, transverse crack and alligator crack, respectively. The results show proposed method can detect the pavement crack and evaluate the type of crack precisely.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-based pavement crack analysis using deep learning","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICTIS.2017.8047878","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8036735/8047710/08047878.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTIS.2017.8047878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Grid-based pavement crack analysis using deep learning","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047878/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17206900","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-based pavement crack analysis using deep learning","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"201700375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045777S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8036735","isNumber":"8047710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8036735","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8047710","articleId":"8047878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8047933,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Min Lee","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea","College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Min","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-0985-6078","id":"37086154279"},{"name":"Dong-Sik Park","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Sik","lastName":"Park","id":"37086150613"},{"name":"Seung-chul Yew","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-chul","lastName":"Yew","id":"37086157081"},{"name":"Soo-Ho Shin","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo-Ho","lastName":"Shin","id":"37278289000"},{"name":"Jun-Yong Noh","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Yong","lastName":"Noh","id":"37663239400"},{"name":"Hyoung-Sub Kim","affiliation":["DRAM Process Architecture Team, Samsung Electronics Co., Hwasung, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Sub","lastName":"Kim","id":"37066745200"},{"name":"Byoung-Deog Choi","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Deog","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0003-0411-4323","id":"37537259600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"8047933","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1620},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047933","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage currents","Capacitors","Dielectrics","Degradation","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","DRAM chips","electric breakdown","integrated circuit reliability","leakage currents","zirconium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-k dielectrics","dynamic random access memory","important concern regarding development","leakage current degradation","dielectric breakdown degradation test","leakage current reduction","DRAM capacitors","size 20.0 nm","ZrO2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitors","dielectric films","DRAM chips","leakage currents","memory architecture"]}],"abstract":"In order to produce a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) of 20 nm or less, the most important concern regarding development is to reduce the leakage current degradation of the capacitor using high-k dielectrics.

For further DRAM scaling, we propose a method of reducing leakage current degradation of the capacitor.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2017.2755050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2017.2755050","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/8079090/08047933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Approach for the Reduction of Leakage Current Characteristics of 20 nm DRAM Capacitors With ZrO<sub>2</sub>\u2013Based High-k Dielectrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Novel Approach for the Reduction of Leakage Current Characteristics of 20 nm DRAM Capacitors With ZrO<sub>2</sub>\u2013Based High-k Dielectrics","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17282358","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047933/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010002","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2016R1D1A1B03931349"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Approach for the Reduction of Leakage Current Characteristics of 20 nm DRAM Capacitors With ZrO<sub>2</sub>\u2013Based High-k Dielectrics","sourcePdf":"led-choi-2755050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097461S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"8079090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8079090","articleId":"8047933","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047934,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuyen Le","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Anh","lastName":"Tuyen Le","orcid":"0000-0002-9229-4557","id":"37086241976"},{"name":"Le Chung Tran","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Le Chung","lastName":"Tran","orcid":"0000-0002-2677-8721","id":"37671757900"},{"name":"Xiaojing Huang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0001-6869-5732","id":"37085386171"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8047934","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","Baseband","Radio frequency","Pulse shaping methods","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","radiofrequency interference","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclostationary analysis","analog least mean square loop","self-interference cancellation","In-Band Full-Duplex Systems","promising mechanism","full-duplex system","weighting error function","ALMS loop","IBFD system","multicarrier signaling","cyclostationary property","transmitted signal","multicarrier system","SI channel","single carrier system","multicarrier counterpart","SI","In"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-band full-duplex","self-interference cancellation","ALMS loop"]}],"abstract":"Analog least mean square (ALMS) loop is a promising mechanism to suppress self-interference (SI) in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) system.

The solution is then applied to IBFD systems with single carrier and multi-carrier signaling. Due to the cyclostationary property of the transmitted signal, the weighting error function in the multi-carrier system varies more significantly than in the single carrier. Therefore, if the ALMS loop can perfectly mimic the SI channel, SI in the single carrier system can be suppressed to a much smaller level than that in the multi-carrier counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755024","startPage":"2738","endPage":"2741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08047934.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary Analysis of Analog Least Mean Square Loop for Self-Interference Cancellation in In-Band Full-Duplex Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary Analysis of Analog Least Mean Square Loop for Self-Interference Cancellation in In-Band Full-Duplex Systems","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17414964","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047934/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160101693"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary Analysis of Analog Least Mean Square Loop for Self-Interference Cancellation in In-Band Full-Duplex Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-le-2755024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101625S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8047934","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047938,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Ye","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Shanghai, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8047938/ye-2754318-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqing Ye received the B.S. degree from Wuhan University, China, in 2014.

Therefore, a deep learning framework is presented in this paper, which focuses on the first and last stage of typical stereo methods: the matching cost computation and the disparity refinement. For matching cost computation, two patch-based network architectures are exploited to allow the trade-off between speed and accuracy, both of which leverage multi-size and multi-layer pooling unit with no strides to learn cross-scale feature representations. For disparity refinement, unlike traditional handcrafted refinement algorithms, we incorporate the initial optimal and sub-optimal disparity maps before outlier detection. Furthermore, diverse base learners are encouraged to focus on specific replacement tasks, corresponding to the smooth regions and details. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which is able to obtain sub-pixel accuracy and restore occlusions to a great extent. Specifically, our accurate framework attains near-peak accuracy both in non-occluded and occluded region and our fast framework achieves competitive performance against the fast algorithms on Middlebury benchmark.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047938.pdf","startPage":"18745","endPage":"18755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754318","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047938","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Network architecture","Computational modeling","Training","Neural networks","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning framework","typical stereo methods","matching cost computation","disparity refinement","patch-based network architectures","cross-scale feature representations","traditional handcrafted refinement algorithms","initial optimal disparity maps","sub-optimal disparity maps","diverse base learners","occlusions","accurate framework attains near-peak accuracy","stereo matching","weak texture","illumination difference","multisize and multilayer pooling unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo vision","matching cost","disparity refinement","convolutional neural network","occlusion restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Stereo Matching Leveraging Deep Local and Context Information","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17266537","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047938/","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601448"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Stereo Matching Leveraging Deep Local and Context Information","sourcePdf":"access-ye-2754318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079517S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047938","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8047939,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Conti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8047939/conti-2755588-small.gif","p":["Stefania Conti received the degree (Hons.) in 1997 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Catania, Italy, in 2001.

When fog-computing nodes cannot be powered by the main electric grid, some environmental-friendly solutions, such as the use of solaror wind-based generators could be adopted. Their relatively unpredictable power output makes it necessary to include an energy storage system in order to provide power, when a peak of work occurs during periods of low-power generation. An optimized management of such an energy storage system in a green fog-computing node is necessary in order to improve the system performance, allowing the system to cope with high job arrival peaks even during low-power generation periods. In this perspective, this paper adopts reinforcement learning to choose a server activation policy that ensures the minimum job loss probability. A case study is presented to show how the proposed system works, and an extensive performance analysis of a fog-computing node highlights the importance of optimizing battery management according to the size of the Renewable-Energy Generator system and the number of available servers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

These three operational modes allow to reconfigure the engineered filtering device as ultra-wideband bandpass filter, narrow-band bandpass filter (NB BPF), and ultra-wideband band-stop filter (UWB BSF). By turning on/off the RF switches, the transmission lines and stubs can be dynamically connected or disconnected so that the three transmission modes can be discretely selected. For the UWB-BPF mode, the 3-dB bandwidth is 95.7% (1.51-4.38 GHz) with minimum in-band insertion loss of 0.94 dB. For the NB-BPF mode, the 3-dB bandwidth is 25.3% (2.55-3.29 GHz), the minimum in-band insertion loss is 0.8 dB, and the stopband rejection is higher than 11.6 dB.

In analog beamforming, each antenna subarray generates a codebook-based directional beam, which determines the equivalent MIMO channel. Then, digital beamforming can be applied to fully exploit the spatial multiplexing gain of MIMO channels. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity analog beam selection scheme to achieve near-optimal spectral efficiency for the split hybrid beamforming system. The core of our scheme is the beam selection criterion, which is derived from capacity analysis. Furthermore, we propose a beam switching algorithm to ensure the robustness when blockage occurs. Through simulations under different channel conditions, the near-optimal performance of our scheme is demonstrated, and the beam switching algorithm is able to ensure robust network connectivity and achieve higher channel capacity when the blockage is relived.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08047946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2753285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"19824","endPage":"19834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity and Robust Codebook-Based Analog Beamforming for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity and Robust Codebook-Based Analog Beamforming for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266538","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047946/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016RC056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005022","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"RCS2017ZT009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M610040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Low Complexity and Robust Codebook-Based Analog Beamforming for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"access-li-2753285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097254S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047946","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8047948,"authors":[{"name":"Duckdong Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8047948/hwang-2754585-small.gif","p":["Duckdong Hwang (M\u201905) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Yonsei University, South Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 2005.

The non-regenerative amplify and forward (AaF) relay is considered with multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas. The residual selfinterference (SI) after analogue domain processing is to be suppressed by the proposed schemes so that the spectral efficiency of FD can be improved. We first analyze the correlation matrix of SI in a matrix power series and derive a convergent form of the correlation matrix so that the SINR expressions can be identified. Leveraging the structure of the SINR function on the beamformer (BF) vectors and power control parameter, two of the proposed schemes try to maximize SINR by optimizing a BF vector through iterative updates exploiting a bisection type search with the other BF vector being fixed. The third proposed scheme alternates over these two schemes to further enhance them by widening the search space that the BF vectors span. We compare the SINR of the proposed schemes with some reference schemes based on zero forcing approaches, maximum ratio reception, and maximum ratio transmission to characterize the performance improvement of the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17266539","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8047948/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SINR Maximizing Beamforming Schemes for the Full Duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relay Channel","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002641","fundingName":"KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea Funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A2B4007398"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SINR Maximizing Beamforming Schemes for the Full Duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2754585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118018S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8047948","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8047949,"authors":[{"name":"Ray-Guang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ray-Guang","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0002-6511-3546","id":"37335957200"},{"name":"Zdenek Becvar","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Becvar","id":"37595063900"},{"name":"Ping-Hsun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ping-Hsun","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-3129-4107","id":"37086283181"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8047949","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":783},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Delays","Protocols","Radiation detectors","Performance evaluation","Long Term Evolution","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","queueing theory","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DQRA","performance analysis","distributed queueing","mobile networks","machine type communications devices","idle mode","random access procedure","radio resources","data transmission","RA procedure","MTC devices","low complexity analytical models","maximum access delay","preamble transmissions","random access protocol","standard RA","power consumption","group paging","LTE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random access","machine type communications","analytical model","distributed queuing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047949","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8249516/08047949.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755020","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Distributed Queueing-Based Random Access for Machine Type Communications in Mobile Networks","abstract":"Machine type communications (MTC) devices stay in idle mode to save energy and should perform random access (RA) procedure to obtain radio resources for data transmission.

As a type of excellent error-correction codes, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can significantly enhance the performance of flash memory. However, the conventional decoding algorithms for LDPC codes suffer from the drawback of high complexity. To address this problem, we propose a serial reliability-based iterative min-sum decoding (RBI-MSD) algorithm for LDPC-coded MLC flash memory systems to strike a desirable trade-off between the performance and complexity. Furthermore, we conceive a novel log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)-distribution-based non-uniform quantization method for the RBI-MSD algorithm. Unlike conventional quantization methods, the proposed non-uniform quantization method substantially exploits the distribution characteristics of channel initial LLRs in MLC flash memory. Simulation results indicate that the proposed non-uniform quantization method not only exhibits more excellent error performance than the conventional non-uniform and uniform counterparts, but also is applicable to other RBI decoding algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8249516/08047952.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LLR-Distribution-Based Non-Uniform Quantization for RBI-MSD Algorithm in MLC Flash Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"LLR-Distribution-Based Non-Uniform Quantization for RBI-MSD Algorithm in MLC Flash Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047952/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17485362","htmlLink":"/document/8047952/","volume":"22","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF of China","grantNumber":"61471131, 61701121 and 61501126"},{"fundingName":"NSF of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A030310337"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2017)"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Innovative Research Team Program","grantNumber":"2014ZT05G157"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Scholar Program","grantNumber":"XJ2016027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LLR-Distribution-Based Non-Uniform Quantization for RBI-MSD Algorithm in MLC Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"lcomm-fang-2755023-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131376S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8249516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8249516","articleId":"8047952","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047954,"authors":[{"name":"Xinying Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Fudan University, Shanghai, China","ZTE (TX) Inc., Morristown, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xinying Li received the Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees in\n communication science and engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Further, only limited CS! is required at relays and BSs, which can greatly reduce the control overhead.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2755049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8069041/08047970.pdf","startPage":"1842","endPage":"1846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2755049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8069041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-Aided NOMA in Uplink Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Aided NOMA in Uplink Cellular Networks","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17279136","htmlLink":"/document/8047970/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1A2B2007102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575 and ECCS-1647198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Aided NOMA in Uplink Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"lsp-lee-2755049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080012S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8069041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8069041","articleId":"8047970","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047992,"authors":[{"name":"Mahima Gupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management Amritsar, Amritsar, India"],"bio":{"p":["Mahima Gupta received the M.Sc. degree in operations research from\n University of Delhi, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in decision sciences from Indian Institute of Management\n Lucknow, India, in 2013.","She has co-authored papers in the journals such as International Journal of Systems Science, Experts System with\n Applications, Computers and Industrial Engineering etc. Her research interests include group decision making, fuzzy\n logic and social media analytics."]},"firstName":"Mahima","lastName":"Gupta","orcid":"0000-0002-2906-4548","id":"37086425416"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"8047992","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1635},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047992","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pragmatics","Buildings","Decision making","Computational modeling","Numerical models","Semantics","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","decision making","fuzzy set theory","group decision support systems","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["implementable decision","consensus evolution process","GDM","consensus building process","group dynamics","group decision making problems","stable decision","adaptive procedure","linguistic form","members opinions","fuzzy if-then rules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","group decision and negotiation","group dynamics","level of adoption","linguistic expression","pairwise comparisons"]}],"abstract":"In group decision making (GDM) problems, it is critical to arrive at an acceptable level of consensus in a group for a stable and implementable decision. This process is carried out by a moderator (either real or virtual) who advises the members to change their opinions in order to achieve higher consensus in the group. In this paper, we present an algorithm that maps the consensus evolution process of GDM based on interrelationships of members in the group. The members' views are taken in linguistic form to incorporate qualitative aspects and vagueness, if any, in their judgment. The novelty of this work lies in the computation of shift in members' opinions depending on their level of adoption of other ideas and support of their ideas in the group. The algorithm accounts for the relations among the members based on their earlier interactions in a network and support of their views contextual to a specific problem. The conditions governing the impact of level of adoption and support in the group are explicated using fuzzy if-then rules. The proposed algorithm converges after a finite number of iterations and maintains consistency in the members' opinions throughout the process.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2755581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2755581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8424402/08047992.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Building Process in Group Decision Making\u2014An Adaptive Procedure Based on Group Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Building Process in Group Decision Making\u2014An Adaptive Procedure Based on Group Dynamics","volume":"26","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8047992/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17973506","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Building Process in Group Decision Making\u2014An Adaptive Procedure Based on Group Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-gupta-2755581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131734S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8047992","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047995,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz F.

In contrast to traditional signal processing, the irregularity of the signal domain makes selecting a sampling set nontrivial and hard to analyze. Indeed, though conditions for graph signal interpolation from noiseless samples exist, they do not lead to a unique sampling set. The presence of noise makes choosing among these sampling sets a hard combinatorial problem. Although greedy sampling schemes are commonly used in practice, they have no performance guarantee. This work takes a twofold approach to address this issue. First, universal performance bounds are derived for the Bayesian estimation of graph signals from noisy samples. In contrast to currently available bounds, they are not restricted to specific sampling schemes and hold for any sampling sets. Second, this paper provides near-optimal guarantees for greedy sampling by introducing the concept of approximate submodularity and updating the classical greedy bound. It then provides explicit bounds on the approximate supermodularity of the interpolation mean-square error showing that it can be optimized with worst case guarantees using greedy search even though it is not supermodular. Simulations illustrate the derived bound for different graph models and show an application of graph signal sampling to reduce the complexity of kernel principal component analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Signal processing","Bayes methods","Kernel","Covariance matrices","Estimation","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","data compression","graph theory","greedy algorithms","interpolation","mean square error methods","optimisation","principal component analysis","sampling methods","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph signal processing","traditional signal processing","signal domain","graph signal interpolation","noiseless samples","sampling sets","hard combinatorial problem","greedy sampling schemes","performance guarantee","universal performance bounds","noisy samples","specific sampling schemes","greedy search","graph signal sampling","graph models","Bayesian estimation","near-optimal guarantees","approximate submodularity","classical greedy bound","interpolation mean-square error","kernel principal component analysis complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph signal processing","sampling","approximate submodularity","greedy algorithms","kernel multivariate analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2755586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8105925/08047995.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8105925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2755586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Greedy Sampling of Graph Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047995","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/8105925/8047995-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Greedy Sampling of Graph Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047995/","volume":"66","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047995/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17372626","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 1717120"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"ARO","grantNumber":"W911NF1710438"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Greedy Sampling of Graph Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-chamon-2755586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105558S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8105925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8105925","articleId":"8047995","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8047997,"authors":[{"name":"Byungju Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8291762/8047997/lee-2755012-small.gif","p":["Byungju Lee (M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Information and Communication, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2008 and 2014, respectively.

The main challenge in fulfilling these requirements is the development of short packet transmission, in contrast to most of the current standards, which use a long data packet structure. Since the available training resources are limited by the packet size, reliable channel and interference covariance estimation with reduced training overhead are crucial to any system using short data packets. In this paper, we propose an efficient receiver that exploits useful information available in the data transmission period to enhance the reliability of the short packet transmission. In the proposed method, the receive filter (i.e., the sample covariance matrix) is estimated using the received samples from the data transmission without using an interference training period. A channel estimation algorithm to use the most reliable data symbols as virtual pilots is employed to improve quality of the channel estimate. Simulation results verify that the proposed receiver algorithms enhance the reception quality of the short packet transmission.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8291762/8047997-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17578001","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8047997/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Packet Structure and Receiver Design for Low Latency Wireless Communications With Ultra-Short Packets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS1642982"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Korean government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478 and 2016K1A3A1A20006019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Packet Structure and Receiver Design for Low Latency Wireless Communications With Ultra-Short Packets","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lee-2755012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122546S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8291762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8291762","articleId":"8047997","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8047998,"authors":[{"name":"Roozbeh Razavi-Far","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Roozbeh","lastName":"Razavi-Far","orcid":"0000-0002-4330-3656","id":"38468117600"},{"name":"Maryam Farajzadeh-Zanjani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Farajzadeh-Zanjani","orcid":"0000-0001-8553-7680","id":"37085702643"},{"name":"Mehrdad Saif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Saif","orcid":"0000-0002-7587-4189","id":"37299107000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-3203"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0050"}],"articleNumber":"8047998","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1559},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-smc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on the development of an integrated scheme for diagnosing bearing defects in induction motors, under the class-imbalanced condition. This scheme comprises of four main modules: segmentation, feature extraction, feature reduction, and fault classification. Various state-of-the-art techniques have been devised in the feature extraction and reduction modules to extract informative sets of features from a raw vibration signal, filter redundant features, and produce the most distinct features for the following module. The fault classification module adapts various state-of-the-art class-imbalanced learning techniques for diagnosing bearing defects. This module contains a novel imputation-based oversampling technique for class-imbalanced learning. This integrated diagnostic scheme is evaluated on three experimental scenarios with different imbalance ratios. The reasonable diagnostic performances confirm the ability of the proposed novel class-imbalanced learning technique in diagnosing bearing defects, independently from the imbalance ratios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8167035/08047998.pdf","startPage":"2758","endPage":"2769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2755064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2755064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8167035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8047998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Class-Imbalanced Learning Scheme for Diagnosing Bearing Defects in Induction Motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Informatics","Induction motors","Mathematical model","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","feature extraction","induction motors","learning (artificial intelligence)","machine bearings","pattern classification","signal classification","vibrational signal processing","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","reduction modules","induction motors","feature reduction","fault classification module","bearing defect diagnosis","class-imbalanced learning","redundant filter features","segmentation","vibration signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bearing defects","Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)","dimensionality reduction (DR), fault diagnosis","feature extraction (FE)","feature selection (FS)","imbalanced condition","induction motors (IMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8047998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Class-Imbalanced Learning Scheme for Diagnosing Bearing Defects in Induction Motors","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8047998/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17466394","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Class-Imbalanced Learning Scheme for Diagnosing Bearing Defects in Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tii-razavifar-2755064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074057S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8167035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8167035","articleId":"8047998","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048001,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Scotti","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/8048001/scott-2750207-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Scotti was born in Cagliari, Italy, in 1975.

Based on the fact that the interference generated by the radar onto the communication receiver is intermittent and depends on the density of scattering objects (such as, e.g., targets), we first show that the communication system is equivalent to a set of independent parallel channels, whereby precoding on each channel can be introduced as a new degree of freedom. We introduce a new figure of merit, named the compound rate, which is a convex combination of rates with and without interference, to be optimized under constraints concerning the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (including signal-dependent interference due to clutter) experienced by the radar and obviously the powers emitted by the two systems: the degrees of freedom are the radar waveform and the aforementioned encoding matrix for the communication symbols. We provide closed-form solutions for the optimum transmit policies for both systems under two basic models for the scattering produced by the radar onto the communication receiver, and account for possible correlation of the signal-independent fraction of the interference impinging on the radar. We also discuss the region of the achievable communication rates with and without interference.

The complexity and variability of the video content and of the mobile wireless channel make this an ideal application for learning approaches. Here, we present D-DASH, a framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of DASH. Different learning architectures are proposed and assessed, combining feed-forward and recurrent deep neural networks with advanced strategies. D-DASH designs are thoroughly evaluated against prominent algorithms from the state-of-the-art, both heuristic and learning-based, evaluating performance indicators such as image quality across video segments and freezing/rebuffering events. Our numerical results are obtained on real and simulated channel traces and show the superiority of D-DASH in nearly all the considered quality metrics. Besides yielding a considerably higher QoE, the D-DASH framework exhibits faster convergence to the rate-selection strategy than the other learning algorithms considered in the study. This makes it possible to shorten the training phase, making D-DASH a good candidate for client-side runtime learning.","doi":"10.1109/TCCN.2017.2755007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687307/8227024/08048013.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2755007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D-DASH: A Deep Q-Learning Framework for DASH Video Streaming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"D-DASH: A Deep Q-Learning Framework for DASH Video Streaming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048013/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17541341","htmlLink":"/document/8048013/","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Padova through the project CPDA 151221 \u201cIoT-SURF: a unifying abstraction and reasoning framework for connected and unconnected objects\u201d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D-DASH: A Deep Q-Learning Framework for DASH Video Streaming","sourcePdf":"tccn-gadaleta-2755007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116936S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6687307","isNumber":"8227024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687307","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"8227024","articleId":"8048013","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048016,"authors":[{"name":"Mosaddek Hossain Kamal Tushar","affiliation":["Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8246762/8048016/tusha-2755465-small.gif","p":["Mosaddek Hossain Kamal Tushar (M\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree\n in applied physics and electronics and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Dhaka University, Dhaka, Bangladesh,\n in 1993 and 1995, the Master in Information Technology from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, N.S.W.,\n Australia, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Concordia University, Montreal,\n QC, Canada, in May 2017.","Before beginning his Ph.D. studies, he was a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering,\n University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 1997 to 2011.

We propose a real-time decentralized demand-side management (RDCDSM) to adjust the real-time residential load to follow a preplanned day-ahead energy generation by the microgrid, based on predicted customers' aggregate load. A deviation from the predicted demand at the time of consumption is assumed to result in additional cost or penalty inflicted on the deviated customers. To develop our system, we formulate a game with mixed strategy which in the first phase (i.e., prediction phase) allows each customer to process the day ahead raw predicted demand to reduce the anticipated electricity cost by generating a flattened curve for its forecasted future demand. Then, in the second stage (i.e., allocation phase), customers play another game with mixed strategy to mitigate the deviation between the instantaneous real-time consumption and the day-ahead predicted one. To achieve this, customers exploit renewable energy and ESSs and decide optimal strategies for their charging/discharging, taking into account their operational constraints. RDCDSM will help the microgrid operator to better deal with uncertainties in the system through better planning its day-ahead electricity generation and purchase, thus increasing the quality of power delivery to the customer. We evaluate the performance of our method against a centralized allocation and an existing decentralized EV charge control noncooperative game method both of which rely on a day ahead demand prediction without any refinement. We run simulations with various microgrid configurations, by varying the load and generated power, and compare the outcomes.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2755465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8246762/08048016.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2755465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand-Side Management by Regulating Charging and Discharging of the EV, ESS, and Utilizing Renewable Energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Demand-Side Management by Regulating Charging and Discharging of the EV, ESS, and Utilizing Renewable Energy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048016/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17485840","htmlLink":"/document/8048016/","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery"},{"fundingName":"Concordia University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand-Side Management by Regulating Charging and Discharging of the EV, ESS, and Utilizing Renewable Energy","sourcePdf":"tii-assi-2755465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064786S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8246762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"8246762","articleId":"8048016","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048019,"authors":[{"name":"Weng-Geng Ho","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Weng-Geng","lastName":"Ho","orcid":"0000-0002-0589-3480","id":"37708994200"},{"name":"Kwen-Siong Chong","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kwen-Siong","lastName":"Chong","id":"37265465500"},{"name":"Kyaw Zwa Lwin Ne","affiliation":["Virtus, IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kyaw Zwa Lwin","lastName":"Ne","id":"37085617663"},{"name":"Bah-Hwee Gwee","affiliation":["Virtus, IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bah-Hwee","lastName":"Gwee","id":"37271115600"},{"name":"Joseph S.

The proposed quad-rail SAHB approach is targeted for area- and energy-efficient asynchronous network-on-chip (ANoC) router designs. There are three main features in the proposed quad-rail SAHB approach. First, the quad-rail SAHB is designed to use four wires for selecting four ANoC router directions, hence reducing the number of transistors and area overhead. Second, the quad-rail SAHB switches only one out of four wires for 2-bit data propagation, hence reducing the number of transistor switchings and dynamic power dissipation. Third, the quad-rail SAHB abides by QDI rules, hence the designed ANoC router features high operational robustness toward process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. Based on the 65-nm CMOS process, we use the proposed quad-rail SAHB to implement and prototype an 18-bit ANoC router design. When benchmarked against the dual-rail counterpart, the proposed quad-rail SAHB ANoC router features 32% smaller area and dissipates 50% lower energy under the same excellent operational robustness toward PVT variations. When compared to the other reported ANoC routers, our proposed quad-rail SAHB ANoC router is one of the high operational robustness, smallest area, and most energy-efficient designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048019/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17468577","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048019/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous-Logic QDI Quad-Rail Sense-Amplifier Half-Buffer Approach for NoC Router Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, through the Public Sector Research Funding","grantNumber":"SERC1321202098"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous-Logic QDI Quad-Rail Sense-Amplifier Half-Buffer Approach for NoC Router Design","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ho-2750171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050468S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8240812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8240812","articleId":"8048019","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048020,"authors":[{"name":"Yerzhan Sapenov","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Yerzhan","lastName":"Sapenov","id":"37086116599"},{"name":"Anas Chaaban","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Chaaban","orcid":"0000-0002-8713-5084","id":"37395687700"},{"name":"Zouheir Rezki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Rezki","orcid":"0000-0002-6491-3648","id":"37294101200"},{"name":"Mohamed Abdallah","affiliation":["College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abdallah","orcid":"0000-0002-3261-7588","id":"37407917800"},{"name":"Khalid Qaraqe","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Program, Texas A&M Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Qaraqe","id":"37391743500"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37085389708"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8048020","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Adaptive optics","Error probability","Power system reliability","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","free-space optical communication","intensity modulation","MIMO communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity order results","MIMO optical wireless communications","intensity-modulation direct-detection","maximal diversity order","spatial repetition coding","practical channel statistics","optical wireless multiple-input multiple-output communication system","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intensity-modulation direct-detection","optical wireless communications","repetition coding","diversity order"]}],"abstract":"An optical wireless multiple-input multiple-output communication system employing intensity-modulation direct-detection is considered.

We consider a network of radars, organized into multiple clusters, whose primary objective is to minimize their transmission power, while satisfying a certain detection criterion. Since there is no communication between the distributed clusters, we incorporate convex optimization methods and noncooperative game-theoretic techniques based on the estimate of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to tackle the power adaptation problem. Therefore, each cluster egotistically determines its optimal power allocation in a distributed scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the best response function of each cluster regarding this generalized Nash game belongs to the framework of standard functions. The standard function property together with the proof of the existence of the solution for the game guarantees the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. The mathematical analysis based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions reveals some interesting results in terms of the number of active radars and the number of radars that over satisfy the desired SINRs. Finally, the simulation results confirm the convergence of the algorithm to the unique solution and demonstrate the distributed nature of the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8081872/08048022.pdf","startPage":"6397","endPage":"6408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2755591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2755591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081872","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game-Theoretic Power Allocation and the Nash Equilibrium Analysis for a Multistatic MIMO Radar Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar cross-sections","Doppler radar","Games","Interference","Resource management","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","game theory","mathematical analysis","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission power","detection criterion","distributed clusters","convex optimization methods","noncooperative game-theoretic techniques","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","power adaptation problem","optimal power allocation","distributed scheme","response function","generalized Nash game","mathematical analysis","active radars","Nash equilibrium analysis","multistatic MIMO radar network","game-theoretic power allocation scheme","multiple-output radar network","multistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar network","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","power allocation","game theory","multistatic radar","Nash equilibrium","noncooperative game"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Game-Theoretic Power Allocation and the Nash Equilibrium Analysis for a Multistatic MIMO Radar Network","volume":"65","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/8048022/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17284777","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K014307/2"},{"fundingName":"MOD University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Processing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Game-Theoretic Power Allocation and the Nash Equilibrium Analysis for a Multistatic MIMO Radar Network","sourcePdf":"tsp-deligiannis-2755591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117083S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8081872","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8081872","articleId":"8048022","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048031,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Parri","affiliation":["Bio Robotics Ins-titute, Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/8196978/8048031/parri-2755048-small.gif","p":["Andrea Parri received the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering (\ncum laude) from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2014.

Subject-specific training and reliance on electromyographic interfaces are the main limitations of existing approaches. This study presents a novel methodology for real-time locomotion mode recognition of locomotion-related activities in lower limb wearable robotics. A hybrid classifier can distinguish among seven locomotion-related activities. First, a time-based approach classifies between static and dynamical states based on gait kinematics data. Second, an event-based fuzzy-logic method triggered by foot pressure sensors operates in a subject-independent fashion on a minimal set of relevant biomechanical features to classify among dynamical modes. The locomotion mode recognition algorithm is implemented on the controller of a portable powered orthosis for hip assistance. An experimental protocol is designed to evaluate the controller performance in an out-of-lab scenario without the need for subject-specific training. Experiments are conducted on six healthy volunteers performing locomotion-related activities at slow, normal, and fast speeds under the zero-torque and assistive mode of the orthosis. The overall accuracy rate of the controller is 99.4% over more than 10 000 steps, including seamless transitions between different modes. The experimental results show a successful subject-independent performance of the controller for wearable robots assisting locomotion-related activities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hip","Legged locomotion","Fuzzy logic","Robot sensing systems","Mechatronics","Wearable computing","Medical robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","fuzzy control","gait analysis","medical signal processing","mobile robots","orthotics","pressure sensors","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subject-specific training","lower limb wearable robots","time-based approach","dynamical modes","real-time hybrid locomotion mode recognition","locomotion-related activities","electromyographic interfaces","hybrid classifier","gait kinematics data","event-based fuzzy-logic method","foot pressure sensors","biomechanical features","portable powered orthosis","hip assistance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy-logic classifier","gait assistance","locomotion mode recognition (LMR)","lower limb wearable robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048031","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2017.2755048","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/8196978/08048031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2017.2755048","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8196978","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Hybrid Locomotion Mode Recognition for Lower Limb Wearable Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Hybrid Locomotion Mode Recognition for Lower Limb Wearable Robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048031/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8048031/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU within the CYBERLEGs Project FP7-ICT-2011-2.1","grantNumber":"287894"},{"fundingName":"CYBERLEGs Plus Plus Project H2020-ICT-2016-1","grantNumber":"731931"},{"fundingName":"Fondazione Pisa within the IUVO","grantNumber":"(Program 154/11)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91648207"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Disabled Persons\u2019 Federation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z141101001814001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Hybrid Locomotion Mode Recognition for Lower Limb Wearable Robots","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2755048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094237S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8196978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8196978","articleId":"8048031","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048033,"authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8103982/8048033/jzhang-2755401-small.gif","p":["Jiliang Zhang (M\u201915) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees\n from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007, 2009, and 2014, respectively.

Recently, the available degrees of freedom (DoF) in the polarization domain has been exploited to reduce the size of the transmit antenna array and provide 1 bit per channel use (bpcu) multiplexing gain for the single-RF MIMO system. Nevertheless, the polarization domain resource still has the potential to provide a higher multiplexing gain in the polarized single-RF MIMO system. In this paper, we propose a generalized polarization shift keying (PolarSK) modulation scheme that uses polarization states in the dual-polarized transmit antenna as an information-bearing unit to increase the overall spectral efficiency. At the receiver, the optimum maximum likelihood (ML) detector is employed to investigate the ultimate performance limit of the PolarSK. A closed-form union upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the PolarSK with the optimum ML receiver is derived. Inspired by the analytic ABEP, a constellation diagram optimization algorithm is proposed. To reduce the computational complexity of the receiver, a linear successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection algorithm and a sphere-decoding (SD) detection algorithm are introduced. Through numerical results, performances of the proposed PolarSK in terms of ABEP and computational complexity are analyzed. Furthermore, the PolarSK is analyzed over measured indoor channels. Numerical and measurement results show that the PolarSK scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art dualpolarized/unipolarized SM schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2755401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8103982/08048033.pdf","startPage":"10139","endPage":"10155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2755401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization Shift Keying (PolarSK): System Scheme and Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Shift Keying (PolarSK): System Scheme and Performance Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048033/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17372550","htmlLink":"/document/8048033/","volume":"66","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501137 and 61371101"},{"fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme-is3DMIMO","grantNumber":"734798"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"lzujbky-2017-38"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Shift Keying (PolarSK): System Scheme and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2755401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145571S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8103982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8103982","articleId":"8048033","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048035,"authors":[{"name":"Haitao Yuan","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8401732/8048035/yuan-2741965-small.gif","p":["Haitao Yuan (S\u201915\u2013M\u201917) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in software engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2016.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA, in 2015.

Currently, a growing number of GDC providers aim to maximize their profit by deploying green energy facilities and decreasing brown energy consumption. However, the temporal variation in the revenue, price of grid, and green energy in tasks' delay bounds makes it challenging for GDC providers to achieve profit maximization while strictly guaranteeing delay constraints of all admitted tasks. Unlike existing studies, a timeaware task scheduling (TATS) algorithm that investigates the temporal variation and schedules all admitted tasks to execute in GDC meeting their delay bounds is proposed. In addition, this paper provides the mathematical modeling of task refusal and service rates. In each iteration, TATS solves the formulated profit maximization problem by hybrid chaotic particle swarm optimization based on simulated annealing. Compared with several existing scheduling algorithms, TATS can increase profit and throughput without violating delay constraints of all admitted tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2017.2741965","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2017.2741965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8401732","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/8401732/08048035.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Aware Multi-Application Task Scheduling With Guaranteed Delay Constraints in Green Data Center","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048035/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-Aware Multi-Application Task Scheduling With Guaranteed Delay Constraints in Green Data Center","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8048035/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17895166","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61703011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600912"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017T100034"},{"fundingName":"High Dynamic Navigation Technology Beijing Key Laboratory","grantNumber":"HDN2017101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Aware Multi-Application Task Scheduling With Guaranteed Delay Constraints in Green Data Center","sourcePdf":"tase-yuan-2741965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122416S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"8401732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8401732","articleId":"8048035","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048038,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Lin Ku","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan","Origin Wireless, Inc., Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8081872/8048038/ku-2755582-small.gif","p":["Meng-Lin Ku (M\u201911) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees\n from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2002, 2003, and 2009, respectively, all in communication\n engineering.

Beamforming technique has been widely adopted by using multiple transmit antennas to form a sharp energy beam toward an intended receiver. However, few of them have considered the potential gain of multipath propagation. In this paper, we propose a joint power waveforming and beamforming in the time domain for WPT, in which the waveforms on multiple transmit antennas driven by a common reference signal are designed to maximize the gain of energy delivery efficiency. We consider both nonperiodic and periodic reference signals and propose low-complexity waveforms that can achieve near-optimal performance. It is found that the energy delivery efficiency gain of the proposed approach increases with the waveform length until saturation. We theoretically analyze the outage probability of the proposed approach under a uniform power delay channel profile, which quantifies the impact of the number of antennas and multipaths. Simulations are performed to validate the theoretic analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed joint power waveforming and beamforming approach.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2755582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8081872/08048038.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2755582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081872","startPage":"6409","endPage":"6422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Waveforming and Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Waveforming and Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"24","publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"17284775","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048038/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power Waveforming and Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2755582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139185S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8081872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8081872","articleId":"8048038","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048040,"authors":[{"name":"Muayad J.

This structure is a generalized form of AND-XOR logic where any combination of NAND, AND, NOR, and OR, and literals can replace the and level. For mPLD-XOR, the computational delay, which is measured as the number of clock cycles, equals the maximum number of inputs to any output XOR gate of a function assuming that the number of XOR gates is large enough to calculate the outputs of the function simultaneously. The input levels of functions are implemented with novel programmable diode gates, which rely on the diode-like behavior of self-rectifying memristors, and the output levels of functions are realized with CMOS modulo-two counters. As an example, the circuit implementation of a 3-bit adder and a 3-bit multiplier are presented. The size and performance of the implemented circuits are estimated and compared with those of the equivalent circuits realized with stateful logic gates. Adding a feedback circuit to the mPLD-XOR allows the implementation of a multilevel XOR logic network with any combination of sums, products, XORs, and literals at the input of any XOR gate. The mPLD-XOR with feedback can reduce the size and number of computational steps (clock cycles) in realizing logic functions, which makes it well suited for use in communication and parallel computing systems where fast arithmetic operations are demanding.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2750074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2750074","startPage":"23","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale

we investigate the link between various resistive memory (RRAM) electrical characteristics: endurance, window margin (WM), and retention. For this purpose, several RRAMs are characterized using various resistive layers and bottom electrodes. By focusing on one technology and optimizing programming conditions (current, voltage, and time), we establish a tradeoff between endurance and WM. Then, by changing memory stack, we demonstrate the correlation between endurance plus window marging improvement and retention degradation. Studying this last feature from a material point of view, we analyze different oxides by density functional theory. We realize a systematic review for possible exchanges of species between resistive layer and Cu-based top electrode and study their diffusion. This provides insights on conductive filament composition in different stacks. Combining previous experiments and simulations, we propose a link between memory characteristics and material microscopic parameters, through the ion energy migration barrier. Finally, we extract how endurance, WM, and retention are correlated to material properties and electrical parameters in order to choose the suitable material for a defined application using the RRAM technology.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2750910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8076920/08048041.pdf","startPage":"4479","endPage":"4485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2750910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8076920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Link Between CBRAM Performances and Material Microscopic Properties Based on Electrical Characterization and Atomistic Simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Link Between CBRAM Performances and Material Microscopic Properties Based on Electrical Characterization and Atomistic Simulations","volume":"64","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17283921","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048041/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048041/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Link Between CBRAM Performances and Material Microscopic Properties Based on Electrical Characterization and Atomistic Simulations","sourcePdf":"ted-nail-2750910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126502S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8076920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8076920","articleId":"8048041","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048042,"authors":[{"name":"Aimeric Bisognin","affiliation":["University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8124133/8048042/bisog-2755439-small.gif","p":["Aimeric Bisognin (S\u201913) was born in Toulouse, France, in 1989.

The antenna system must be compact and cost effective while delivering an approximately 30 dBi gain in the working band, defined as 120 to 140 GHz. Accordingly, a 2 \u00d7 2 array of aperture-coupled patch antennas was designed in the 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 0.362 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n BGA module as the feed antenna of the lens. This achieved a 7.8 dBi realized gain, broadside polarization purity above 20 dB, and over 55% total efficiency from 110 to 140 GHz (20% bandwidth). A plastic elliptical lens 40 mm in diameter and 42.3 mm in height was placed on top of the BGA module. The antenna achieved a return loss better than -10 dB and a 28 dBi realized gain from 114 to 140 GHz.

The proposed hybrid access schemes allow for sharing the same downlink resources between the small-cell network and the original macrocell network, and their mode of operations are characterized considering post-processed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) or preprocessed interference-aware operation. This paper presents a detailed treatment of achieved performance of a desired user that benefits from MIMO arrays configuration through the use of transmit antenna selection (TAS) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) in the presence of Poisson field interference processes on spatial links. Furthermore, based on the interference awareness at the desired user, two TAS approaches are treated, which are the signal-to-noise-based selection and SINR-based selection. The analysis is generalized to address the cases of highly-correlated and un-correlated aggregated interference on different transmit channels. In addition, the effect of delayed TAS due to imperfect feedback and the impact of arbitrary TAS processing are investigated. The analytical results are validated by simulations, to clarify some of the main outcomes herein.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519944","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048046/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Access Femtocells in Overlaid MIMO Cellular Networks With Transmit Selection Under Poisson Field Interference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) grant through National Priority Research Program (NPRP)","grantNumber":"8-1545-2-657"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Access Femtocells in Overlaid MIMO Cellular Networks With Transmit Selection Under Poisson Field Interference","sourcePdf":"tcomm-abdelnabi-2755006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135198S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8048046","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048047,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8387744/8048047/lin-2754378-small.gif","p":["Zhe Lin (S'15) received the BS degree from the School of\n Electronic Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

In this trend, FPGA-based accelerators are becoming increasingly attractive, due to their excellent flexibility and low design cost. In this paper, we propose the architectural support for efficient interfacing between FPGA-based multi-accelerators and chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) connected through the network-on-chip (NoC). Distributed packet receivers and hierarchical packet senders are designed to maintain scalability and reduce the critical path delay under a heavy task load. A dedicated accelerator chaining mechanism is also proposed to facilitate intra-FPGA data reuse among accelerators to circumvent prohibitive communication overhead between the FPGA and processors. In order to evaluate the proposed architecture, a complete system emulation with programmability support is performed using FPGA prototyping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture has high-performance, and is light-weight and scalable in characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2754378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2017.2754378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/8387744/08048047.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Light-Weight Integration of FPGA Based Accelerators with Chip Multi-Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Light-Weight Integration of FPGA Based Accelerators with Chip Multi-Processors","volume":"4","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048047/","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840578","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048047/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"HKUST","grantNumber":"R9336"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Light-Weight Integration of FPGA Based Accelerators with Chip Multi-Processors","sourcePdf":"tmscs-lin-2754378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165519S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"8387744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","xplore-issue":"8387744","articleId":"8048047","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048092,"authors":[{"name":"Seungkyeong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seungkyeong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086085235"},{"name":"Sangmin Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co.

LSWSNs are promising techniques in many areas such as target detection and tracking, commercial management, intelligent family, military use, preventing forest fire loss, medical diagnostic, etc. In LSWSNs, maximizing the network lifetime of each and every sensor node separately will not lead to optimum power utilization for the complete networking. Maximizing the network lifetime under the energy ability and sensing radius constraints is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, a novel adaptive hybrid clone genetic algorithm (AHCGA) is given and utilized on optimal node scheduling problem. We first develop our objective function to maximize the network lifetime under many constraints. The resulting AHCGA approach integrates the merits of adaptive adjusting and niche selection while maintaining the contention for the genetic algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of AHCGA, simulations are executed for the optimal node scheduling problem, and performance comparisons are made with ant colony optimization (ACO) and cat swarm optimization (CSO). Simulation results demonstrate that the presented technique can achieve a longer network lifetime over ACO and

Propagation Neural Network with BSASA Optimization for Time Series Forecasting","abstract":"Time series forecasting plays a vital role in stable developments of economy and industry, the precaution of natural hazard, even adjustment of energy policy. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is always viewed as a predictor which powers in dealing with nonlinear problems associated with time series forecasting. However, BPNN easily falls into local minimum. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel hybrid approach called RBM-BSASA-BP is presented. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) firstly provides rough parameters for BPNN via pre-training process. The improved Backtracking Search Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (BSASA) is then employed to fine-tune the parameters for the purpose of seeking out the optimal weights and biases. Finally, optimized BPNN is utilized to accomplish forecasting tasks. Verified by artificial time series and real-world time series, the proposed hybrid approach defeats the state-of-the-art methods and it is proved to be a promising forecasting algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048147/","accessionNumber":"17207379","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8048147/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RBM-Based Back Propagation Neural Network with BSASA Optimization for Time Series Forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBM-Based Back Propagation Neural Network with BSASA Optimization for Time Series Forecasting","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3022b218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050109S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8046763","isNumber":"8047731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046763","xplore-issue":"8047731","articleId":"8048147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8048156,"authors":[{"name":"Yuancan Huang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuancan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536903100"},{"name":"Shuai Li","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Li","id":"37085865647"},{"name":"Siqi Li","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086010202"},{"name":"Yin Ke","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Ke","id":"37086016083"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3021-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3023-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8048156","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048156","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Safety","Manipulators","Collision avoidance","Effective mass","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","elasticity","end effectors","human-robot interaction","ISO standards","manipulator kinematics","modal analysis","nonlinear control systems","safety","springs (mechanical)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-arm robot","homogeneous compliant joint","physical Human-Robot Interaction","safety studies","collision analysis","inherent safety","human-robot collision","effective mass","stiffness","safety criterion","modal analysis","single arm","lowest order modal frequency","safety requirement","pHRI","end-effecter","EE","ISO 15066","kinematic performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dual-arm robot","compliant joint","safety","modal analysis"]}],"abstract":"Safety is essential for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI).

Finally, spring stiffness of the compliant joint is selected to balance safety requirement and performance.","doi":"10.1109/IHMSC.2017.172","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8046763/8047731/08048156.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IHMSC.2017.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8047731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of Dual-Arm Robot with Homogeneous Compliant Joint","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of Dual-Arm Robot with Homogeneous Compliant Joint","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048156/","accessionNumber":"17207318","volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of Dual-Arm Robot with Homogeneous Compliant Joint","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3022b265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051862S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8046763","isNumber":"8047731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046763","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8047731","articleId":"8048156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8048161,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Kang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085892427"},{"name":"Shouming Zhong","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shouming","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37292866500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3022-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3021-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3023-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8048161","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Symmetric matrices","Neural networks","Memristors","Neurons","Trajectory","Time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time memristive neural network","time-varying delay","delay-dependent passivity conditions","passivity analysis","set-valued map","difference inclusions","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","linear matrix inequalities","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passivity","Memristive neural networks","Timevarying delay","LMIs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048161","abstract":"In this paper, the passivity problem is studied for discrete-time memristive neural networks with time-varying delay.

Due to the significant heat dissipation from the switching behavior of power semiconductor devices, the interactions between thermal, electrical and mechanical aspects become very important to not only power electronics packaging design, but also long-term reliability of power modules. The interactions become more and more significant as the development of wideband gap power semiconductor devices has pushed the power modules to be able to operate at higher voltage levels, higher ambient temperature and higher switching frequencies. Power module development relies more and more on Finite Element Method (FEM) based multiphysics simulations, reducing design cycles, to couple the electrical, thermal and mechanical fields in simulations of different processes such as power module assembly, operations and reliability assessments. In this paper, several cases were introduced to demonstrate how multiphysics simulation worked in power module development. The first case was the simulation of the fringing effects to estimate the difference between practical parasitic capacitance value and theoretical parasitic capacitance value of double-side metallized ultra-thin ceramic. The second case was the pre-stress analysis of power module substrate made of a specific ultra-thin ceramic. The third case was the study of electrical field distribution and temperature distribution in a high voltage and high temperature Silicon Carbide power module. The last case was parasitics extraction of a PCB busbar for 50 kW Electric Vehicle Motor Drive Applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Multichip modules","Ceramics","Stress","Silicon carbide","Electrodes","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["busbars","ceramics","circuit simulation","cooling","electric vehicles","finite element analysis","motor drives","power semiconductor devices","printed circuits","semiconductor device packaging","semiconductor device reliability","silicon compounds","temperature distribution","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle motor drive application","PCB busbar","silicon carbide power module","temperature distribution","electrical field distribution","pre-stress analysis","double-side metallized ultrathin ceramic","parasitic capacitance","power module assembly","FEM","finite element method","wide band gap power semiconductor device","power module reliability","switching behavior","heat dissipation","military application","aircraft application","automotive application","consumer electronics","power electronic packaging design","multiphysics simulation","power 50 kW","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiphysics simulation","finite element method","power electronics","power module","packaging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048203","doi":"10.1109/3DPEIM.2016.8048203","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on 3D Power Electronics Integration and Manufacturing (3D-PEIM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on 3D Power Electronics Integration and Manufacturing (3D-PEIM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7563732/7570448/08048203.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7570448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DPEIM.2016.8048203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","xploreNote":"This article was mistakenly omitted from the original submission to IEEE Xplore.

We proposed a TB-ADC architecture combining a flash ADC and TDC to achieve both high speeds and a high resolution. The flash ADC and the ADC using a VTC and TDC are pipelined to enhance the conversion speed. The charge steering amplifier is used for the low-power residue transfer. Moreover, the Vernier TDC using the dynamic delayer enables low-power operation. An 8-bit ADC test chip fabricated using 65-nm CMOS technology demonstrated a high sampling frequency of 900 MHz and a low-power consumption of 3.5 mW.

The proposed DPD compensates for the combined effects of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity, antenna crosstalk, and impedance mismatch. The proposed technique consists of a linear crosstalk and mismatch model block shared by all transmit paths and a dual-input DPD block in every transmit path. By avoiding the use of multi-input DPD blocks in every transmit path, the complexity of the proposed technique is kept low and scales more favorably with the number of antennas than competing techniques. It is shown that all blocks can be identified from measurements of the PA output signals using least-squares estimation. Measurement results of a four-path transmitter are presented and used to evaluate the proposed DPD technique against existing techniques. The results show that the performance of the proposed DPD technique is similar to those of existing techniques, while the complexity is lower.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Predistortion for Multi-Antenna Transmitters Affected by Antenna Crosstalk","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2748948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8306523/08048330.pdf","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2017.2748948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Digital Predistortion for Multi-Antenna Transmitters Affected by Antenna Crosstalk","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8048330/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600030","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GigaHertz Centre in a joint project financed by the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VIN-NOVA), Chalmers University of Technology, Ericsson, Infineon Technologies Austria, Ampleon, National Instruments, Gotmic, and Saab"},{"fundingName":"EMPIR programme co-financed by the Participating States and from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Predistortion for Multi-Antenna Transmitters Affected by Antenna Crosstalk","sourcePdf":"tmtt-hausmair-2748948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082751S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8306523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8306523","articleId":"8048330","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048340,"authors":[{"name":"Ayushi Barthwal","affiliation":["Centre for Applied Research in Electronics, IIT Delhi, Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8280662/8048340/barth-2751044-small.gif","p":["Ayushi Barthwal (S\u201914) received the master\u2019s degree in microwave and optical communication from Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India, in 2012.

The measured drain efficiency of 50%-61.8% at 12-dB back-off and 51.9%-66.2% at 6-dB back-off is obtained over the frequency range of 600-900 MHz. Over this 300-MHz band, the drain efficiency is between 51.1% and 78% at saturation. This corresponds to 40% fractional bandwidth.

The lablet contains a 20Hz low-power clock generator, a sensor, electric actuators, and a simple finite state machine to implement a predefined response to the sensor input. It is designed to be rechargeable and to communicate via local contacts through aqueous solution either between lablets or with a docking station chip. The system operates with supply voltages ranging from 0.3 to 1.8V and is thus suitable to be supplied from a capacitor with decreasing voltage. An input rectifier allows powering the lablet independent of polarity. The average current consumption of the system was measured to be 1.3nA when supplied from a capacitor with an initial voltage of 1.8V. The small system scale allows the investigation of \u201cpourable electronics\u201d, a concept where large quantities of microsystems are deployed within a chemical solution to perform a predefined task. Several lablets have been designed and fabricated in a standard 180nm CMOS process and the electrical functionality has been verified by contacting the lablet electrodes with multiple probe needles. In order to use low voltage energy sources to supply the lablet, a voltage up-converter has been designed which is small enough to fit on the lablet.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2750905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8119588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2750905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8119588/08048341.pdf","startPage":"3013","endPage":"3024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A $200~\\mu \\text{m}$ by $100~\\mu \\text{m}$ Smart Submersible System With an Average Current Consumption of 1.3nA and a Compatible Voltage Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A $200~\\mu \\text{m}$ by $100~\\mu \\text{m}$ Smart Submersible System With an Average Current Consumption of 1.3nA and a Compatible Voltage Converter","volume":"64","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048341/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17390371","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"318671"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000925","fundingName":"John Templeton Foundation provided through the Earth-Life Science Institute of the Tokyo Institute of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A $200~\\mu \\text{m}$ by $100~\\mu \\text{m}$ Smart Submersible System With an Average Current Consumption of 1.3nA and a Compatible Voltage Converter","sourcePdf":"tcsi-funke-2750905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085456S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8119588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8119588","articleId":"8048341","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048343,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Kun Wei","affiliation":["School of Physical Electronics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8118236/8048343/wei-2747404-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Kun Wei (S\u201916) was born in Tianshui, China, in 1990.

After much development, it is now poised to enter the market as a storage-class memory (SCM), with performance and cost between that of NAND flash and DRAM. In this paper, we review the history of phase-transforming chalcogenides leading up to our current understanding of PCM as either a storage-type SCM, with high-density and better than NAND flash endurance, write speeds, and retention, or a memory-type SCM, with fast read/write times to function as a nonvolatile DRAM. Several of the key findings from the community relating to device dimensional scaling, cell design, thermal engineering, material exploration, and storing multiple levels per cell will be discussed. These areas have dramatically impacted the course of development and understanding of PCM. We will highlight the performance gains attained and the future prospects, which will help drive PCM to be as ubiquitous as NAND flash in the upcoming decade.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2017.2746342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2017.2746342","startPage":"4374","endPage":"4385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/8076920/08048346.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8076920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Change Memory\u2014Towards a Storage-Class Memory","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/16/8076920/8048346-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Change Memory\u2014Towards a Storage-Class Memory","volume":"64","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17282233","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005492","fundingName":"Stanford Non-Volatile Memory Technology Research Initiative at Stanford University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"MARCO and DARPA through SONIC, one of six centers of STARnet, a Semiconductor Research Corporation Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"DGE-4747"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Phase-Change Memory\u2014Towards a Storage-Class Memory","sourcePdf":"ted-fong-2746342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125178S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"8076920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"8076920","articleId":"8048346","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048349,"authors":[{"name":"Byungsul Min","affiliation":["Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin, Emmerthal, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Byungsul","lastName":"Min","orcid":"0000-0002-8895-7434","id":"37085361588"},{"name":"Matthias M\u00fcller","affiliation":["TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Institute of Applied Physics, Freiberg, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"38238114300"},{"name":"Hannes Wagner","affiliation":["Global Photovoltaic Simulation Group, Geneva 1211, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Wagner","id":"38310841000"},{"name":"Gerd Fischer","affiliation":["Hochschule Zittau/G\u00f6rlitz, Zittau, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37086244717"},{"name":"Rolf Brendel","affiliation":["Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin, Emmerthal, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Brendel","orcid":"0000-0001-8259-564X","id":"37265019800"},{"name":"Pietro P.

Specifically, the carrier PA of the designed DPA operates in a continuous class-J mode when the peaking PA is in the OFF-state, where the output impedance of the peaking PA has some influences on the carrier PA. When the peaking transistor is in the OFF-state, the load impedance variation of the carrier transistor versus noninfinity peaking impedance is presented in this contribution. The proposed method surmounts the back-off drain efficiency deterioration of DPAs at two side working bands through elaborately processing the noninfinity peaking impedance. This paper also presents a method to derive the required OFF-state output impedance of the peaking stage by the carrier PA in a symmetrical broadband DPA. A broadband CM-DPA working over 1.6-2.7 GHz (bandwidth of 51%) is designed and fabricated for interpreting our theories. The simulated load trajectory of the carrier transistor is in line with the design space of continuous class-J mode. Under continuous wave excitation, experimental results show the drain efficiencies of 46.5%-63.5% at 6-dB output back-off power levels and 56%-75.3% at peaking power levels. The maximum output power of this DPA is 43.8-45.2 dBm with a gain of 9.4-11.5 dB across the whole working band. Furthermore, a 20-MHz LTE modulated signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 7.4 dB is also applied to the fabricated CM-DPA at 2.2 GHz. At an average output power of 37.5 dBm, measurement results show the adjacent channel power ratios of -30.2 and -50.1 dBc before and after digital predistortion, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"17574129","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048350/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Continuous-Mode Doherty Power Amplifiers With Noninfinity Peaking Impedance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271036 and 61571080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Continuous-Mode Doherty Power Amplifiers With Noninfinity Peaking Impedance","sourcePdf":"tmtt-shi-2749224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113437S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8280662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8280662","articleId":"8048350","onlineDate":"21 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048378,"authors":[{"name":"Giampaolo Buticchi","affiliation":["University of Kiel, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Giampaolo Buticchi (buticchi@ieee.org) received his M.S. degree in electronic engineering in 2009 and his Ph.D. degree in information technologies in 2013 from the University of Parma, Italy.

The core systems of the actuation still rely on hydraulic power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17205319","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048378/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving System Efficiency for the More Electric Aircraft: A Look at dc\\/dc Converters for the Avionic Onboard dc Microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving System Efficiency for the More Electric Aircraft: A Look at dc\\/dc Converters for the Avionic Onboard dc Microgrid","sourcePdf":"11mie03-buticchi-2723911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088833S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"8048210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8048210","articleId":"8048378","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048383,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Guarnieri","affiliation":["IEF, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud XI / CNRS, Orsay cedex, France"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Guarnieri","id":"37297375500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-4529"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0115"}],"articleNumber":"8048383","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Negative feedback","Telephone sets","Repeaters","Attenuation","Technological innovation","Feedback amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","feedback amplifiers","harmonic distortion","history","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invention","negative feedback amplifier","IEEE Milestones","Bell Labs","Western Electric","Type C system","vacuum-tube","repeater amplifiers","harmonic distortion","telephone industry","line longitudinal inductance L","three-channel telephone network","signal attenuation","Pupin loading coils","line longitudinal inductance","Heaviside condition","distortionless transmission","longitudinal resistance","transverse capacitance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048383","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2017.2726244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2017.2726244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048210","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4154573/8048210/08048383.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative Feedback, Amplifiers, Governors, and More [Historical]","abstract":"The invention of the negative feedback amplifier by Harold S. Black (1898-1983) in 1928 is considered one of the great achievements in electronics. In fact, it is listed among the IEEE Milestones, where it is credited to Bell Labs. Black was hired by Western Electric in 1921 and assigned to work on the Type C system, a newly introduced three-channel telephone network whose push-pull, vacuum-tube, repeater amplifiers produce too much harmonic distortion when connected in tandem [1]. At that time, telephone networks were spreading, and Bell Labs emerged quickly as the major research company in the telephone industry. The extension of lines over long distances required counteracting signal attenuation, which occurred, though at a reduced level, even in lines provided with Pupin's loading coils, which discretely increased the line longitudinal inductance L so as to match the Heaviside condition L/R=C/G for distortionless transmission (R being the longitudinal resistance and C and G the transverse capacitance and conductance, respectively).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048383/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17205317","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Negative Feedback, Amplifiers, Governors, and More [Historical]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative Feedback, Amplifiers, Governors, and More [Historical]","sourcePdf":"11mie03-historical-2726244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033231S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"8048210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","xplore-issue":"8048210","articleId":"8048383","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8048384,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibo Pang","affiliation":["KTH, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","ABB Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["\nZhibo Pang (pang.zhibo@se.abb.com) received his B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2002; his M.B.A. degree in innovation and growth from the University of Turku, Finland, in 2012; and his Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer systems from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2013.

Therefore, numerous active power-decoupling techniques have been introduced to decouple the double-line frequency ripple power. However, no comprehensive comparisons are available on the permitted minimum capacitance for power decoupling, dc voltage utilization, current stress, modulation complexity, and even application evaluations, except for power rating and component counts. All of these aspects are critical when choosing appropriate power-decoupling techniques for different applications. In this article, the minimum capacitance to decouple the ripple power and the current stress of power devices in the main circuit are derived in light of different voltages across energy storage capacitors. By considering the ripple power paths, we investigate the dc voltage utilization of both the main circuit and power-decoupling circuit. Combined with other features, including component counts and modulation complexity, the overall characteristics of different power-decoupling techniques are compared and summarized to effectively evaluate their performance in different applications.","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2016.2627013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2016.2627013","startPage":"37","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4154573/8048210/08048388.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitance, dc Voltage Utilizaton, and Current Stress: Comparison of Double-Line Frequency Ripple Power Decoupling for Single-Phase Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Capacitance, dc Voltage Utilizaton, and Current Stress: Comparison of Double-Line Frequency Ripple Power Decoupling for Single-Phase Systems","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2017","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048388/","accessionNumber":"17205318","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048388/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitance, dc Voltage Utilizaton, and Current Stress: Comparison of Double-Line Frequency Ripple Power Decoupling for Single-Phase Systems","sourcePdf":"11mie03-zhang-2627013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108672S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"8048210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8048210","articleId":"8048388","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8048389,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Dolores Valdes Pena","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo"],"bio":{"p":["Mar\u00eda Dolores Vald\u00e9s Pe\u00f1a (mvaldes@uvigo.es) received her M.Sc. degree from the Universidad Central de Las Villas, Santa Clara, Cuba, in 1990, and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Vigo, Spain, in 1997, both in electrical engineering.

However, problems occur when it comes to protecting this complex electrical system because the current protection methods have shortcomings. Meanwhile, there are studies on developing protection schemes based on wavelet transform (WT), which are suitable for the point-to-point networks, but are insufficient for the MTDC networks. Therefore, this paper has conducted the transient analysis of a MTDC network after faults and presented a new WT-based protection. A protection scheme is then proposed.

We take full advantage of the transmission characteristics of the coreless fiber, and the experimental results evidence that TCF is able to excite surface plasmon wave effectively. Compared with common SPR sensors, this sensor is easier to fabricate, has better mechanical stability, and offers a comparable sensitivity. The wavelength interrogation sensitivity of the proposed sensor is 2278.4 nm/RIU in the RI range of 1.33-1.391. As the structure of the proposed sensor can lead to multimode interference (MMI), and the gold film is only coated on one side of TCF, MMI spectra appear in the visible light band instead of in the near-infrared. When surrounding RI increases, the resonance wavelength shifts to shorter wavelengths. We get an ultrahigh wavelength interrogation sensitivity, 866.1 nm/RIU, compared with common MMI RI sensors, in the RI range of 1.3864-1.416. Because both SPR and MMI are sensitive to the change of surrounding RI, this sensor can achieve a wide detection range when we use these two phenomena together.","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8067628/08048460.pdf","startPage":"4734","endPage":"4739","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2755668","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2755668","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048460","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber sensors","Optical fibers","Optical surface waves","Gold","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antireflection coatings","fibre optic sensors","gold","infrared spectra","light interference","light transmission","optical films","refractive index","refractive index measurement","surface plasmon resonance","visible spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface plasmon resonance refractive index sensor","tapered coreless optical fiber structure","resonance wavelength shifts","ultrahigh wavelength interrogation sensitivity","multimode interference","MMI refractive index sensors","gold film coating","visible light band","near-infrare spectra","light transmission characteristics","Au"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fibre optics components","fibre optics sensors","optical sensing and sensors","surface plasmons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Surface Plasmon Resonance Refractive Index Sensor Based on Tapered Coreless Optical Fiber Structure","accessionNumber":"17243687","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048460/","volume":"35","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"No.LY17F050010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Plasmon Resonance Refractive Index Sensor Based on Tapered Coreless Optical Fiber Structure","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhao-2755668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059088S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8067628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8067628","articleId":"8048460","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":8048461,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Makki","orcid":"0000-0001-7863-997X","id":"37289967200"},{"name":"Tommy Svensson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tommy","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37294450000"},{"name":"Koen Buisman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Buisman","orcid":"0000-0003-1861-8418","id":"37285088500"},{"name":"Joaquin Perez","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Perez","orcid":"0000-0003-0191-3533","id":"37307179800"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Department of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8048461","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":887},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048461","abstract":"We propose and analyze a wireless energy and information transmission scheme in free-space optical (FSO) links.

Especially, effective anomaly detection, based on telemetry data, plays an important role for the system health management of a spacecraft. With the advantages of easy-to-use, high efficiency, and data-driven, the predicted model has been applied for anomalous point detection for monitoring data. However, compared with the point abnormal mode, fragment anomaly is more attractive and meaningful for the system identification. Therefore, the detection strategy of fragment anomaly is proposed based on the uncertainty estimation of least square support vector machine and statistical analysis. Moreover, some effective estimation indicators are presented to evaluate the performance of the detection method. Experimental validations are also carried out for some typical simulation data sets and open source data sets. In particular, relied on the analysis of fragment anomaly modes, experiments are conducted with the real satellite telemetry data and different anomaly modes are injected to examine the applicability of the proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08048464.pdf","startPage":"19269","endPage":"19281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fragment Anomaly Detection With Prediction and Statistical Analysis for Satellite Telemetry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048464","topic":"Complex System Health Management based on Condition Monitoring and Test Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048464/","displayDocTitle":"Fragment Anomaly Detection With Prediction and Statistical Analysis for Satellite Telemetry","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266541","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048464/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571160, 61771157 and 61301205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fragment Anomaly Detection With Prediction and Statistical Analysis for Satellite Telemetry","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2754447-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086502S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Complex System Health Management based on Condition Monitoring and Test Data"],"articleId":"8048464","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048465,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hao Liao","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8048465/liao-2755858-small.gif","p":["Chun-Hao Liao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2017.

Specifically, we investigate the combination of LoRa, a physical-layer standard that can provide several-kilometer outdoor coverage, and concurrent transmission (CT), a recently proposed multi-hop protocol that can significantly improve the network efficiency. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) Since the CT enhances the network efficiency by allowing synchronized packet collisions, the performance of the physical-layer receiver under such packet collisions needs to be carefully examined to ensure the network reliability. We first extensively evaluate the LoRa receiver performance under CT to verify that LoRa is compatible to CT. Specifically, we find that, due to the time-domain and frequency-domain energy spreading effect, LoRa is robust to the packet collisions resulting from CT. 2) We further find the receiver performance under CT can be further improved by introducing timing offsets between the relaying packets. In view of this, we propose a timing delay insertion method, the offset-CT method, that adds random timing delay before the packets while preventing the timing offset from diverging over the multi-hop network. 3) We conduct proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of CT-based LoRa multi-hop network and the performance improvement brought by the proposed offset-CT method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Spread spectrum communication","Standards","Frequency shift keying","Timing","Protocols","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

The chip stack comprises an image sensing tier produced in a 65-nm image sensor technology and a data processing tier in 40-nm CMOS. Using a simple, CMOS-compatible technique, the pixel is capable of passive quenching and active recharge at voltages well above those imposed by a single transistor whilst ensuring that the reliability limits across the gate-source (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GS</sub>\n), gate-drain (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GD</sub>\n) and drain- source (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DS</sub>\n) are not exceeded for any device. For a given technology, the circuit extends the maximum excess bias that SPADs can be operated at when using transistors as quenching elements, thus improving the SPAD sensitivity, timing performance, and photon detection probability uniformity. Implemented with 2.5-V thick oxide transistors and operated at 4.4-V excess bias, the design achieves a timing jitter of 95-ps full-width at half maximum, maximum photon detection efficiency (PDE) of 21.9% at 660 nm and 0.08% afterpulsing probabilitywith a dead time of 8 ns. This is both the lowest afterpulsing probability at 8-ns dead time and the highest peak PDE for a BSI SPAD in a 3D IC technology to date.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2017.2755989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/8079090/08048467.pdf","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2017.2755989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8079090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-PDE, Backside-Illuminated SPAD in 65/40-nm 3D IC CMOS Pixel With Cascoded Passive Quenching and Active Recharge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048467/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A High-PDE, Backside-Illuminated SPAD in 65/40-nm 3D IC CMOS Pixel With Cascoded Passive Quenching and Active Recharge","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17282368","htmlLink":"/document/8048467/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Competence Center for Biomedical Imaging"},{"fundingName":"STW","grantNumber":"L3SPAD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-PDE, Backside-Illuminated SPAD in 65/40-nm 3D IC CMOS Pixel With Cascoded Passive Quenching and Active Recharge","sourcePdf":"led-lindner-2755989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118403S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"8079090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8079090","articleId":"8048467","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8048469,"authors":[{"name":"Hemani Kaushal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Communication Engineering, The NorthCap University, Gurgaon, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8048469/kaush-2755678-small.gif","p":["Hemani Kaushal received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Punjab Technical University, India, in 2001, the M.E. degree in electronics product design and technology from PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, India, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India, in 2012.

This technology is used for a wide range of applications including medical sciences, military, industrial manufacturing, electronics, holography, spectroscopy, astronomy and much more. Military operations often demand a secure and timely transmission of a massive amount of information from one place to another. Until now, the military has relied on the radio spectrum for effective communication, which is vulnerable to security threats and susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Also, this spectrum is hard-pressed to meet the current bandwidth requirement for high-resolution images, on-air video conferencing and real-time data transfer. Therefore, the focus has shifted to visible and infrared spectrum using laser technology which is capable of providing secure data transfer because of its immunity to EMI. The probability of intercepting a laser signal is very low due to its narrow beam divergence and coherent optical beam, making the laser a suitable candidate for secure military tactical operations. Besides the communication aspect, the highly directive nature of a laser beam is also used as a directed energy laser weapon. These highly powerful and light weighted directed energy laser weapons are very cost-effective countermeasures for airborne threats. Furthermore, laser sensors are deployed in the battlefield or in space for tracking the path of a wide range of military vehicles like missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, fighter aircraft, warships, submarines, and so on. Advancements in space operations and laser technology have offered synergistic possibilities of using lasers from space-based platforms during military operations. In this paper, we are providing our readers with a comprehensive study of laser applications, used by the military, to carry out tactical operations on the ground or space-based platforms. Also, an intensive investigation on the development of laser technology for sensors, range-finders and target designators that are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is presented in the paper. The advancement of laser communication for military purposes and its current state of the art is reviewed as well as some recent scientific developments in the area of high-energy directed laser weapons are discussed, which have revolutionized military battlefields. Therefore, this manuscript highlights recent trends and engineering breakthroughs for the use of lasers in tactical operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17515809","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048469/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Lasers for Tactical Military Operations","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Applications of Lasers for Tactical Military Operations","sourcePdf":"access-kaushal-2755678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126689S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8048469","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048472,"authors":[{"name":"Jiexin Yin","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technology Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiexin","lastName":"Yin","orcid":"0000-0002-8651-869X","id":"37086227293"},{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technology Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-6533-9206","id":"37086223022"},{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technology Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293505600"},{"name":"Ruirui Liu","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China","National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technology Research Center, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ruirui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086228751"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8048472","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Covariance matrices","Doppler shift","Sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Doppler shift","radionavigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving array","weighted subspace fitting method","alternating projection procedure","direct localization","multiple stationary narrowband sources","direct position determination","single-step method","sensor outputs","angle information","DPD algorithm","multiple stationary transmitters","location information","Doppler shifts","signal subspaces","space-time steering vectors","intermediate parameter estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passive localization","direct position determination (DPD)","weighted subspace fitting (WSF)","angle","Doppler shift"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08048472.pdf","startPage":"2630","endPage":"2633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755656","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2755656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Localization of Multiple Stationary Narrowband Sources Based on Angle and Doppler","abstract":"Direct position determination (DPD) is a single-step method that directly localizes transmitters from sensor outputs without estimating intermediate parameters.

However, this raises several security concerns when the relays are untrusted, since they may have access to the relayed message. In this paper, we study the achievable secrecy diversity order of cooperative networks with untrusted relays. In particular, we consider a network with an N-antenna transmitter (Alice), K single-antenna relays, and a single-antenna destination (Bob). We consider the general scenario, where there is no relation between N and K, and therefore, K can be larger than N. Alice and Bob are assumed to be far away from each other, and all communication is done through the relays, i.e., there is no direct link. Providing secure communication while enhancing the diversity order has been shown to be very challenging. In fact, it has been shown in the literature that the maximum achievable secrecy diversity order for the adopted system model is one (while using artificial noise jamming). In this paper, we adopt a nonlinear interference alignment scheme that we have proposed recently to transmit the signals from Alice to Bob. We analyze the proposed scheme in terms of the achievable secrecy rate and secrecy diversity order. Assuming Gaussian inputs, we derive an explicit expression for the achievable secrecy rate and show analytically that a secrecy diversity order of up to min(N, K) - 1 can be achieved using the proposed technique. We provide several numerical examples to validate the obtained analytical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique to its counterparts that exist in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17519938","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048487/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Achievable Secrecy Diversity of Cooperative Networks With Untrusted Relays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) under NPRP","grantNumber":"NPRP8-052-2-029"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grant"},{"fundingName":"FQRNT Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002914","fundingName":"Concordia University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Achievable Secrecy Diversity of Cooperative Networks With Untrusted Relays","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ghrayeb-2755654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104436S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8048487","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048490,"authors":[{"name":"Charlotte Curtis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Charlotte","lastName":"Curtis","id":"38243380400"},{"name":"Benjamin R.

Heart murmurs are the most common abnormal finding when a patient visits the physician for auscultation. These heart sounds can either be innocent, which are harmless, or abnormal, which may be a sign of a more serious heart condition. However, the accuracy rate of primary care physicians and expert cardiologists when auscultating is not good enough to avoid most of both type-I (healthy patients are sent for echocardiogram) and type-II (pathological patients are sent home without medication or treatment) errors made. In this paper, the authors present a novel convolutional neural network based tool for classifying between healthy people and pathological patients using a neuromorphic auditory sensor for FPGA that is able to decompose the audio into frequency bands in real time. For this purpose, different networks have been trained with the heart murmur information contained in heart sound recordings obtained from nine different heart sound databases sourced from multiple research groups. These samples are segmented and preprocessed using the neuromorphic auditory sensor to decompose their audio information into frequency bands and, after that, sonogram images with the same size are generated. These images have been used to train and test different convolutional neural network architectures. The best results have been obtained with a modified version of the AlexNet model, achieving 97% accuracy (specificity: 95.12%, sensitivity: 93.20%, PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 score: 0.9416). This tool could aid cardiologists and primary care physicians in the auscultation process, improving the decision making task and reducing type-I and type-II errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17491334","pubMedId":"28952948","htmlLink":"/document/8048493/","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Neural Networks for the Recognition and Classification of Heart Murmurs Using Neuromorphic Auditory Sensors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish government","grantNumber":"TEC2016-77785-P"},{"fundingName":"Formaci\u00f3n de Personal Universitario Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Neural Networks for the Recognition and Classification of Heart Murmurs Using Neuromorphic Auditory Sensors","sourcePdf":"tbcas-dominguezmorales-2751545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051297S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8269836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8269836","articleId":"8048493","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048496,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno M.

Numerical results in different scenarios show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving very competitive recovery error rates when compared with other existing suboptimal approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08048496.pdf","startPage":"19562","endPage":"19569","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2754586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Recovery Algorithm for Discrete Valued Sparse Signals Using an ADMM Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Recovery Algorithm for Discrete Valued Sparse Signals Using an ADMM Approach","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8048496/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266544","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"FCT - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia and Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Recovery Algorithm for Discrete Valued Sparse Signals Using an ADMM Approach","sourcePdf":"access-souto-2754586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079328S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8048496","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8048498,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsuhiko Watanabe","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetic Fields, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Tatsuhiko Watanabe (M\u201912) was born in Japan, in 1989.

In this work a vertical grating coupler which satisfies both high directionality (> 97%) and low back-reflection (<; 1%) simultaneously is realized using a blazed sub-wavelength structure. The measured maximum coupling efficiencies with a standard single-mfiber are -1.5 dB and -2.2 dB for apodized and periodic structures, respectively. The suggested structure offers an ultimate solution for compact coupling schemes in Si photonics, since it meets the most important needs of grating couplers, which are directionality, ease of fabrication, and a possibility to vertically couple.

electroencephalography (EEG) data, especially in the field of interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detection, have traditionally employed handcrafted features, which utilized specific characteristics of neural responses. Although these algorithms achieve high accuracy, mere detection of an IED holds little clinical significance. In this paper, we consider deep learning for epileptic subjects to accommodate automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing clinical insight. Convolutional neural networks are trained in a subject independent fashion to demonstrate how meaningful features are automatically learned in a hierarchical process. We illustrate how the convolved filters in the deepest layers provide insight toward the different types of IEDs within the group, as confirmed by our expert clinicians. The morphology of the IEDs found in filters can help evaluate the treatment of a patient. To improve the learning of the deep model, moderately different score classes are utilized as opposed to binary IED and non-IED labels. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance and is also invariant to time differences between the IEDs. This paper suggests that deep learning is suitable for automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing insight into the data.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2755770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8168802/08048515.pdf","startPage":"2285","endPage":"2294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8168802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2755770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Interictal Discharges With Convolutional Neural Networks Using Discrete Ordered Multichannel Intracranial EEG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Interictal Discharges With Convolutional Neural Networks Using Discrete Ordered Multichannel Intracranial EEG","htmlLink":"/document/8048515/","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17397773","pubMedId":"28952945","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Interictal Discharges With Convolutional Neural Networks Using Discrete Ordered Multichannel Intracranial EEG","sourcePdf":"tnsre-antoniades-2755770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13987S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8168802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8168802","articleId":"8048515","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048518,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqiang Lu","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8071125/8048518/lu-2755766-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqiang Lu (M\u201914\u2013SM\u201915) is currently a Full Professor with the Xi\u2019an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi\u2019an, China, and also with the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

The traditional hashing methods usually learn hash functions to obtain binary codes by exploiting hand-crafted features, which cannot optimally represent the information of the sample. Recently, deep learning methods can achieve better performance, since deep learning architectures can learn more effective image representation features. However, these methods only use semantic features to generate hash codes by shallow projection but ignore texture details. In this paper, we proposed a novel hashing method, namely hierarchical recurrent neural hashing (HRNH), to exploit hierarchical recurrent neural network to generate effective hash codes. There are three contributions of this paper. First, a deep hashing method is proposed to extensively exploit both spatial details and semantic information, in which, we leverage hierarchical convolutional features to construct image pyramid representation. Second, our proposed deep network can exploit directly convolutional feature maps as input to preserve the spatial structure of convolutional feature maps. Finally, we propose a new loss function that considers the quantization error of binarizing the continuous embeddings into the discrete binary codes, and simultaneously maintains the semantic similarity and balanceable property of hash codes. Experimental results on four widely used data sets demonstrate that the proposed HRNH can achieve superior performance over other state-of-the-art hashing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2755766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8071125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2755766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8071125/08048518.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Hashing for Image Retrieval With Hierarchical Convolutional Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Hashing for Image Retrieval With Hierarchical Convolutional Features","volume":"27","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048518/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17260109","pubMedId":"28952940","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61761130079, 61472413 and 61772510"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS","grantNumber":"QYZDY-SSW-JSC044"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Young Top-notch Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"QYZDB-SSW-JSC015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Hashing for Image Retrieval With Hierarchical Convolutional Features","sourcePdf":"tip-lu-2755766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163633S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8048518","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048519,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Galindo","affiliation":["Instituto Universitario de Matem\u00e1ticas y Aplicaciones de Castell\u00f3n, Jaume I University, Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Carlos Galindo was born in Valladolid, Spain, on October 27, 1962.

The major challenge lies in how to preserve similarity of the same person across video footages with large appearance variations, while discriminating different individuals. To address this problem, conventional methods usually consider the pairwise similarity between persons by only measuring the point-to-point distance. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning technique to model a novel set-to-set (S2S) distance, in which the underline objective focuses on preserving the compactness of intraclass samples for each camera view, while maximizing the margin between the intraclass set and interclass set. The S2S distance metric consists of three terms, namely, the class-identity term, the relative distance term, and the regularization term. The class-identity term keeps the intraclass samples within each camera view gathering together, the relative distance term maximizes the distance between the intraclass class set and interclass set across different camera views, and the regularization term smoothes the parameters of the deep convolutional neural network. As a result, the final learned deep model can effectively find out the matched target to the probe object among various candidates in the video gallery by learning discriminative and stable feature representations. Using the CUHK01, CUHK03, PRID2011, and Market1501 benchmark datasets, we extensively conducted comparative evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048520/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17578118","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large Margin Learning in Set-to-Set Similarity Comparison for Person Reidentification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473219"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Margin Learning in Set-to-Set Similarity Comparison for Person Reidentification","sourcePdf":"tmm-wang-2755983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118675S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8291714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8291714","articleId":"8048520","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":8048521,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy","Large Systems and Networks Group, Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8048521/zappo-2755644-small.gif","p":["Alessio Zappone (SM\u201916) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy.

A multi-objective approach is taken dealing with both performance metrics, while ensuring a minimum quality-of-service to each user in the network. Each user in the network is modeled as a rational agent that engages in a generalized non-cooperative game. Feasibility conditions are derived for the existence of each player's best response, and used to show that if these conditions are met, the game best response dynamics will converge to a unique Nash equilibrium. Based on these results, a convergent power control algorithm is derived, which can be implemented in a fully decentralized fashion. Next, a centralized power control algorithm is proposed, which also serves as a benchmark for the proposed decentralized solution. Due to the non-convexity of the centralized problem, the tool of maximum block improvement is used, to tradeoff complexity with optimality.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2755644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2755644","startPage":"418","endPage":"431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08048521.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Delay Efficient Power Control in Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Delay Efficient Power Control in Wireless Networks","volume":"66","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17519942","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048521/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"H2020 MSCA IF BESMART","grantNumber":"749336"},{"fundingName":"ERC Starting","grantNumber":"305123 MORE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Delay Efficient Power Control in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zappone-2755644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267217S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8048521","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048523,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Hou","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8350354/8048523/hou-2755862-small.gif","p":["Jia Hou received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and\n automation from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2011, where she is currently\n working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her research interests include contactless resonant converters and wireless power transfer system."]},"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Hou","orcid":"0000-0002-6379-9644","id":"37078419000"},{"name":"Qianhong Chen","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8350354/8048523/chen-2755862-small.gif","p":["Qianhong Chen (M\u201906) received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees\n in electrical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), Nanjing, China, in 1995,\n 1998, and 2001, respectively.","In 2001, she joined NUAA, where she is currently a Professor in the Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center.

Converters having an inherently small output current fluctuation versus variations of load and coupling are attractive solutions since such converters can be controlled to achieve constant current with minimum control efforts. In this paper, the impedance conditions and the output current characteristics for different compensation types are presented. It is shown that the types of compensation producing load- and coupling-independent output current at the designed operating point as well as having a unimodal dependence of the output current on coupling would achieve better output current performance against variations of load and coupling. The sensitivities of the output current to parameter variation of typical compensation types are quantitatively analyzed and compared. Analytical results indicate that the primary parallel-series and secondary series compensation, which produces output current that exhibits a unimodal relationship with coupling and is nearly immune to coupling variation at the designed operating point, has the smallest output current fluctuation versus variation of the coupling coefficient. Finally, a comparison of experimental results of different types of compensation is presented for verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"33","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17750722","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048523/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Output Current Characteristics for Higher Order Primary Compensation in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Funding for Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation in NUAA","grantNumber":"BCXJ14-05"},{"fundingName":"Lite-On Power Electronics Technology Research Fund"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Output Current Characteristics for Higher Order Primary Compensation in Inductive Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-chen-2755862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119571S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8350354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8350354","articleId":"8048523","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048526,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048526/zhou-2753779-small.gif","p":["Pei Zhou received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, School of Information Science and Technology.

The IEEE has released the 802.11ad standard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed communication. It adopts beamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate for high path loss. In the association beamforming training (A-BFT) phase of BF training, a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to contend for training opportunity. Due to the limited number of A-BFT slots, the A-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios, resulting in inefficient training performance. Based on the evaluation of the IEEE 802.11ad standard and 802.11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave wireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT beam training and random access mechanism, including the separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and secondary backoff A-BFT (SBA-BFT). The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide the A-BFT slots into two regions by defining a new E-A-BFT Length field compared with the legacy 802.11ad A-BFT, thereby maintaining compatibility when 802.11ay devices are mixed with 802.11ad devices. It can also greatly reduce the collision probability in dense user scenarios. The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff with very small overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not only further reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots utilization. Furthermore, we propose a 3-D Markov model to analyze the performance of the SBA-BFT. The analytical and simulation results show that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training efficiency, which is beneficial to the optimization design of dense user wireless networks based on the IEEE 802.11ay standard and mmWave technology.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048526.pdf","startPage":"7760","endPage":"7773","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2753779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2753779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Random Access and Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Wireless Local Networks With High User Density","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8170465/8048526-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Random Access and Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Wireless Local Networks With High User Density","htmlLink":"/document/8048526/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415069","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61471303 and 61601380"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Guangdong Joint Foundation","grantNumber":"U1501255"},{"fundingName":"EP7-PEOPLE-2013-IRSES Project","grantNumber":"612652"},{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP Flagship Project","grantNumber":"YB2015070106"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1717736 and CNS-1343356"},{"fundingName":"Huawei HIRP Flagship Project","grantNumber":"YB2015070106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enhanced Random Access and Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Wireless Local Networks With High User Density","sourcePdf":"twc-fang-2753779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093343S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048526","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048530,"authors":[{"name":"Boran Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power System, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8350354/8048530/fan-2755767-small.gif","p":["Boran Fan (S'13) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1989.

Recent researches have proved its significant advantages for adjustable-speed motor drives compared with the back-to-back modular multilevel converter. However, the branch energy balancing in the M3C presents great challenge especially at critical-frequency points where the output frequency is close to zero or grid-side frequency. Generally, this balancing control depends on the appropriate injection of inner circulating currents and the common-mode voltage (CMV), whereas their values are hard to determine and optimize. In this paper, an optimization-based predictive control method is proposed to calculate the required circulating currents and the CMV. The proposed method features a broad frequency range balancing of capacitor voltages and no reactive power in the grid side. For operation at critical-frequency points, there is no increase on branch voltage stresses and limited increase on branch current stresses. A downscaled M3C system with 27 cells is designed and experiment results with the R-L load and induction motor load are presented to verify the proposed control method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2755767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8350354/08048530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2755767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350354","startPage":"6608","endPage":"6621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Full Frequency Control Strategy for the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter Based on Predictive Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Full Frequency Control Strategy for the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter Based on Predictive Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17736987","dateOfInsertion":"27 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8048530/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Education Development Program of Delta Environmental and Educational Foundation","grantNumber":"DREK2015001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Full Frequency Control Strategy for the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter Based on Predictive Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-fan-2755767-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097433S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8350354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8350354","articleId":"8048530","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8048532,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Carminati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/8241892/8048532/carmi-2748158-small.gif","p":["Marco Carminati (M\u201907) was born in 1981.

In this paper, the design, implementation, and results of a complete 3-D imaging frequency-modulated continuous-wave MIMO radar demonstrator are presented. The radar sensor working frequency range spans between 16 and 17 GHz, and the proposed solution is based on a 24-transmitter and 24-receiver MIMO radar architecture, implemented by time-division multiplexing of the transmit signals. A modular approach based on conventional low-cost printed circuit boards is used for the transmit and receive systems. Using digital beamforming algorithms and radar processing techniques on the received signals, a high-resolution 3-D sensing of the range, azimuth, and elevation can be calculated. With the current antenna configuration, an angular resolution of 2.9\u00b0 can be reached. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the 1-GHz bandwidth of the system, a range resolution of 0.5 m is achieved. The radio-frequency front-end, digital system and radar signal processing units are here presented. The medium-range surveillance potential and the high-resolution capabilities of the MIMO radar are proved with results in the form of radar images captured from the field measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2746739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8240806/08048534.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2746739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Portable 3-D Imaging FMCW MIMO Radar Demonstrator With a $24\\times 24$ Antenna Array for Medium-Range Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048534/","displayDocTitle":"A Portable 3-D Imaging FMCW MIMO Radar Demonstrator With a $24\\times 24$ Antenna Array for Medium-Range Applications","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17468517","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048534/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Portable 3-D Imaging FMCW MIMO Radar Demonstrator With a $24\\times 24$ Antenna Array for Medium-Range Applications","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ganis-2746739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106253S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8240806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8240806","articleId":"8048534","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048540,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Mohammadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8314245/8048540/moham-2750762-small.gif","p":["Babak Mohammadi (S\u201912\u2013M\u201917) received the Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2017, and 2012, respectively.

An ideal power management scenario in a single supply system is achieved by permanently keeping the storage elements in the vicinity of the retention voltage. Performance and reliability is regained by boosting the voltage on critical nodes. The cost of voltage boost generation unit is minimized by 66 low-power and area efficient ON-chip charge pumps, i.e., 64 for boosting the voltages on write-bitlines and two for the wordlines. The charge pump energy overhead is reduced by introducing a new boost paradigm with an on-demand activation mechanism that generates the required boost level in a single clock cycle. A sense amplifier-less read architecture enables a reliable and high performance read operation. Measurements identify several meritorious metrics. The minimum read energy is identified as 8.4fJ/bit-access, achieved for 90-MHz operation at 0.3V. Furthermore, the minimum operating voltage is measured as 240mV, and data is retained in ultra-low voltage regime, ranging down to 0.2V.

In the multiple access phase, the TIEs transmit information to the relay using the energy harvested in the last time block, and the relay decodes information using zeroforcing (ZF) or maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique. In the broadcasting phase, the relay performs simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and each TIE receives energy and information using the power-splitting scheme. Due to the channel hardening effect of the large-scale antenna array, the harvested energy of each TIE in each time block is asymptotically constant. Based on the derived achievable rates of TIEs, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to maximize the achievable rates of all the pairs. Through solving the MOOP, the power-splitting ratios of TIEs can be determined in closed-form for the ZF-based relaying. For the MRC-based relaying, a two-stage iterative Pareto improvement algorithm is proposed to achieve the Pareto optimality. Simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical analysis and verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm in improving the system rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17372703","htmlLink":"/document/8048547/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Power Transfer-Based Multi-Pair Two-Way Relaying With Massive Antennas","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371188"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2017YFC0803403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong","grantNumber":"ZR2017MF066"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009108","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003091","fundingName":"Special Funds for Postdoctoral Innovative Projects of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"201401013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Power Transfer-Based Multi-Pair Two-Way Relaying With Massive Antennas","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2753223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152174S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8103134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8103134","articleId":"8048547","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048548,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Xie","affiliation":["Air Traffic Management Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/8196978/8048548/xie-2755669-small.gif","p":["Hui Xie received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from\n Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2007; the M.Sc. degree in mechatronics engineering from the Harbin\n Institute of Technology, Harbin, in 2009; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the\n University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2016.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the Air Traffic Management Research Institute, Nanyang Technological\n University, Singapore.

The objective is to regulate the relative position and yaw of the vehicle to a planar target consisting of multiple points using a minimal sensor set, i.e., an inertial measurement unit and a vision sensor. A set of first order image moment features, defined in the image plane of a virtual camera with zero roll and pitch motion, is used for visual servoing. It has been observed in previous work that various system uncertainties, such as aerodynamics constants and attitude estimation bias, result in steady-state errors if not being compensated. By treating those uncertainties as unknown system parameters, an adaptive backstepping controller is developed. As the given visual servoing law is an output feedback controller, the translational velocity measurement from the global position system is not required. The asymptotic stability of the error dynamics is proven. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the controller performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2017.2755669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2017.2755669","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/8196978/08048548.pdf","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8196978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Visual Servoing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Visual Servoing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","volume":"22","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446997","htmlLink":"/document/8048548/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Air Traffic Management Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"},{"fundingName":"Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBU)","grantNumber":"NTU-ATMRI 2014-D1-LOW"},{"fundingName":"Traffic Management of Unmanned Aerial Systems (TM-UAS)","grantNumber":"NTU-ATMRI 2016-D3-LOW"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Visual Servoing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in GPS-Denied Environments","sourcePdf":"tmech-xie-2755669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09098S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8196978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8196978","articleId":"8048548","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048551,"authors":[{"name":"Changchun Hua","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center for Equipment and Technology of Cold Strip Rolling, Yanshan Univeristy, Qinhuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8424402/8048551/hua-2756028-small.gif","p":["Changchun Hua received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Yanshan\n University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2005.

In addition, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are use to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and dynamic surface control (DSC) method is employed to eliminate the explosion of complexity problem inherent in traditional backstepping method. The proposed controllers of corresponding subsystems guarantee that all closed-loop signals remain bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time (ADT). A numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2756028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8424402/08048551.pdf","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2756028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Prescribed Performance Control for Nonlinear Switched Time-Delay Systems With Unmodeled Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048551/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Prescribed Performance Control for Nonlinear Switched Time-Delay Systems With Unmodeled Dynamics","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17989842","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048551/","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61290322, 61673335, 61603329, 61603330 and 61503323"},{"fundingName":"Basic Research Program of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2016203467"},{"fundingName":"Hebei Province Applied Basis Research Project","grantNumber":"15967629D"},{"fundingName":"Top Talents Project of Hebei Province"},{"fundingName":"Yanshan University Project","grantNumber":"13LGA020"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy","grantNumber":"KF16252"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Prescribed Performance Control for Nonlinear Switched Time-Delay Systems With Unmodeled Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-hua-2756028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102829S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8424402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8424402","articleId":"8048551","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048552,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen W.

That is, flows have hard end-to-end delay requirements that have to be deterministically guaranteed. While proprietary extensions of Ethernet have provided solutions, these often require expensive forwarding devices. The rise of software-defined networking (SDN) opens the door to the design of centralized traffic engineering frameworks for providing such real-time guarantees. As part of such a framework, a network model is needed for the computation of worst-case delays and for access control. In this paper, we propose two network models based on network calculus theory for providing deterministic services (DetServ). While our first model, the multi-hop model (MHM), assigns a rate and a buffer budget to each queue in the network, our second model, the threshold-based model (TBM), simply fixes a maximum delay for each queue. Via a packet-level simulation, we confirm that the delay bounds guaranteed by both models are never exceeded and that no packet loss occurs. We further show that the TBM provides more flexibility with respect to the characteristics of the flows to be embedded and that it has the potential of accepting more flows in a given network. Finally, we show that the runtime cost for this increase in flexibility stays reasonable for online request processing in industrial scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048552/","accessionNumber":"17415002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DetServ: Network Models for Real-Time QoS Provisioning in SDN-Based Industrial Environments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (VirtuWind)","grantNumber":"671648"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011199","fundingName":"ERC (FlexNets)","grantNumber":"647158"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DetServ: Network Models for Real-Time QoS Provisioning in SDN-Based Industrial Environments","sourcePdf":"tnsm-guck-2755769-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093995S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8170467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8170467","articleId":"8048552","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048556,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of the Ministry of Education of China, International Research Center of Intelligent Perception and Computation, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8240806/8048556/xliu-2750220-small.gif","p":["Xu Liu (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the North University of China, Taiyuan, China, in 2013.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have been widely applied in many areas of image processing. In this paper, an end-to-end learning framework based on deep multiple instance learning (DMIL) is proposed for MS and PAN images' classification using the joint spectral and spatial information based on feature fusion. There are two instances in the proposed framework: one instance is used to capture the spatial information of PAN and the other is used to describe the spectral information of MS. The features obtained by the two instances are concatenated directly, which can be treated as simple fusion features. To fully fuse the spatial-spectral information for further classification, the simple fusion features are fed into a fusion network with three fully connected layers to learn the high-level fusion features. Classification experiments carried out on four different airborne MS and PAN images indicate that the classifier provides feasible and efficient solution. It demonstrates that DMIL performs better than using a convolutional neural network and a stacked autoencoder network separately. In addition, this paper shows that the DMIL model can learn and fuse spectral and spatial information effectively, and has huge potential for MS and PAN imagery classification.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2750220","startPage":"461","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2750220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8240806/08048556.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Multiple Instance Learning-Based Spatial\u2013Spectral Classification for PAN and MS Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048556/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Multiple Instance Learning-Based Spatial\u2013Spectral Classification for PAN and MS Imagery","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8048556/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17468532","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91438201 and 91438103"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Multiple Instance Learning-Based Spatial\u2013Spectral Classification for PAN and MS Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-liu-2750220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112642S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8240806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8240806","articleId":"8048556","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8048557,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Makki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048557/makki-2753225-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Makki received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in bioelectric engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, and the Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.

The results are obtained in cases with and without hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). Using the central limit theorem as well as other state-of-the-art approximation schemes, we derive closed-form expressions for the networks' outage probability and ergodic achievable rates. We also evaluate the effect of various parameters such as power amplifiers efficiency, number of antennas as well as different coherence times of the RF and the FSO links on the system performance. Finally, we determine the minimum number of the transmit antennas in the RF link such that the same rate is supported in the RF- and the FSO-based hops. The results show the efficiency of the RF-FSO setups in different conditions. Moreover, HARQ can effectively improve the outage probability/energy efficiency, and compensate for the effect of hardware impairments in RF-FSO networks. For common parameter settings of the RF-FSO dual-hop networks, outage probability of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n and code rate of 3 nats-per-channel-use, the implementation of HARQ with a maximum of 2 and 3 retransmissions reduces the required power, compared to cases with open-loop communication, by 13 and 17 dB, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17415071","htmlLink":"/document/8048557/","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Millimeter Wave-Based RF-FSO Multi-Hop and Mesh Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission H2020 Programme 5G PPP mmMAGIC project","grantNumber":"671650"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) within the VINN Excellence Center Chase"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Millimeter Wave-Based RF-FSO Multi-Hop and Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-makki-2753225-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110406S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048557","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8048558,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Galluccio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Catania, Catania, CT, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8048558/gallu-2755649-small.gif","p":["Laura Galluccio (S\u201904\u2013M\u201905) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical, computer, and telecommunications engineering from the University of Catania in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

An emerging approach to implement this type of communications is based on discrete (or droplet-based) microfluidics. It exploits the idea to represent binary information by encapsulating the signaling molecules inside droplets, which are dispersed in an immiscible fluid and delivered, through micro pipes to the destination. The objective of this paper is to study a binary droplet-based microfluidic system for flow-induced molecular communications from an information theoretical perspective. To this end, we first show that the binary discrete microfluidic channel is characterized by memory and anticipation. Accordingly, we provide a mathematical model based on a finite-state Markov chain. Finally, we evaluate the capacity of the binary droplet-based microfluidic channel.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2755649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2755649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08048558.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of a Binary Droplet-Based Microfluidic Channel With Memory and Anticipation for Flow-Induced Molecular Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of a Binary Droplet-Based Microfluidic Channel With Memory and Anticipation for Flow-Induced Molecular Communications","volume":"66","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048558/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17490349","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048558/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of a Binary Droplet-Based Microfluidic Channel With Memory and Anticipation for Flow-Induced Molecular Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-schembra-2755649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096855S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8048558","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8048604,"authors":[{"name":"Shitao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shitao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085880976"},{"name":"Dazhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dazhi","lastName":"Ding","orcid":"0000-0001-8522-6233","id":"37276060400"},{"name":"Zhenhong Fan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhong","lastName":"Fan","id":"37288662000"},{"name":"Rushan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Rushan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276948300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8048604","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave circuits","Mathematical model","Couplings","Time-domain analysis","Integrated circuit modeling","PIN photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral equations","microwave limiters","Newton method","p-i-n diodes","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain volume-surface integral equation","diode charge-control model","improved solution scheme","nonlinear field-circuit coupling equations","microwave positive intrinsic-negative diode limiter","field-circuit coupling algorithm","microwave limiter","nonlinear analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-circuit coupling algorithm","positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode limiter","spike leakage and flat leakage","time-domain volume-surface integral equation (TD-VSIE)"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents the nonlinear analysis of the physical characteristic of a microwave positive intrinsic-negative diode limiter using the field-circuit coupling algorithm based on a time-domain volume-surface integral equation method.

This is motivated by the reduction in the number of radio frequency and mixed signal hardware components. Hybrid precoding involves a combination of analog and digital processing that enables both beamforming and spatial multiplexing gains in mmWave systems. This paper develops hybrid analog/digital precoding and combining designs for mmWave multiuser systems, based on the mean-squared error (MSE) criteria. In the first design with the analog combiners being determined at the users, the proposed hybrid minimum MSE (MMSE) precoder is realized by minimizing the sum-MSE of the data streams intended for the users. In the second design, both the hybrid precoder and combiners are jointly designed in an iterative manner to minimize a weighted sum-MSE cost function. By leveraging the sparse structure of mmWave channels, the MMSE precoding/combining design problems are then formulated as sparse reconstruction problems. An orthogonal matching pursuit-based algorithm is then developed to determine the MMSE precoder and combiners. Simulation results show the performance advantages of the proposed precoding/combining designs in various system settings.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/7859429/8048606-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17266545","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048606/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid MMSE Precoding and Combining Designs for mmWave Multiuser Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007099","fundingName":"San Diego State University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC\u2013CRD Project CRDPJ 461894\u201313"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC Grants"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1702800"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Hybrid MMSE Precoding and Combining Designs for mmWave Multiuser Systems","sourcePdf":"access-nguyen-2754979-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130011S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8048606","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048609,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad G.

This does not always provide accurate results as our analysis show the cross-stream correlation due to interference can greatly affect the coverage performance. This paper analyzes the coverage probability in such systems, and studies the impact of cross-stream correlation. Specifically, we focus on the max-SIR cell association policy and leverage stochastic geometry to study scenarios, whereby a receiver is considered in the coverage, if all of its data-streams are successfully decodeable. Assuming open-loop maximum ratio combining (MRC) at receivers, we consider the cases where partial channel state information is available at the receiver. We then obtain an upper-bound on the coverage and formulate cross-stream SIR correlation. We further show that approximating such systems based on fully-correlated (non-correlated) data-streams results in a slight underestimation (substantial overestimation) of the coverage performance. Our results provide insights on the multiplexing regimes where densification improves the coverage performance and spectral efficiency. We also compare MRC with more complex zero-forcing receiver and provide quantitative insights on the design tradeoffs. Our analysis is validated via extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2753771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048609.pdf","startPage":"7816","endPage":"7833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2753771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Multi-Stream MIMO HetNets With MRC Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048609/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Multi-Stream MIMO HetNets With MRC Receivers","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415052","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048609/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671088"},{"fundingName":"Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Analysis of Multi-Stream MIMO HetNets With MRC Receivers","sourcePdf":"twc-khoshkholgh-2753771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142777S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048609","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048610,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8425132/8048610/liu-2748381-small.gif","p":["Kai Liu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong in 2011.

In particular, we consider the scenario where vehicles request a set of information and they could be served via heterogeneous wireless interfaces, such as roadside units and base stations (BSs). We formulate a novel problem of coding-assisted broadcast scheduling (CBS), aiming at maximizing the broadcast efficiency for the limited BS bandwidth by exploring the synergistic effect between vehicular caching and network coding. We prove the NP-hardness of the CBS problem by constructing a polynomial-time reduction from the simultaneous matrix completion problem. To efficiently solve the CBS problem, we employ memetic computing, which is a nature inspired computational paradigm for tackling complex problems. Specifically, we propose a memetic algorithm, which consists of a binary vector representation for encoding solutions, a fitness function for solution evaluation, a set of operators for offspring generation, a local search method for solution enhancement, and a repair operator for fixing infeasible solutions. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding-Assisted Broadcast Scheduling via Memetic Computing in SDN-Based Vehicular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2017.2748381","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8425132/08048610.pdf","startPage":"2420","endPage":"2431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2017.2748381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048610/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Coding-Assisted Broadcast Scheduling via Memetic Computing in SDN-Based Vehicular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8048610/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17990264","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572088 and 61603064"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Application Foundation and Research in Cutting-Edge Technologies","grantNumber":"cstc2017jcyjAX0026"},{"fundingName":"Frontier Interdisciplinary Research Fund for Central Universities","grantNumber":"106112017CDJQJ188828"},{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of MSIP/IITP, Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems Research","grantNumber":"14-824-09-013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2013K1A1A2A02078326"},{"fundingName":"DGIST Research and Development Program (CPS Global Center)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding-Assisted Broadcast Scheduling via Memetic Computing in SDN-Based Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-liu-2748381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096081S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8425132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8425132","articleId":"8048610","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048611,"authors":[{"name":"Long Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048611/yang-2754261-small.gif","p":["Long Yang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010 and 2015, respectively.

For the designed NOMA unicast-multicast system, an efficient two-phase cooperation strategy is proposed to improve the reliability of all users. In the first phase, the base station (BS) broadcasts a superposed message consisting of all users' information. In the second phase, a multicast user is selected to forward the information intended by unsuccessfully decoded unicast and/or multicast users. Moreover, the multicast user selection is investigated under two different power allocation (PA) approaches: 1) fixed PA (FPA), in which the PA coefficients for both the phases are predetermined, and 2) dynamic PA (DPA), in which the PA coefficients for the first phase are predetermined, while the PA coefficients for the second phase are dynamically determined based on instantaneous channel information. Under the FPA approach, a best user selection (BUS) scheme (called F-BUS) is proposed to minimize the outage probability. Under the DPA approach, the local optimal PA coefficients for the second phase are derived in closed form first. Based on the derived PA coefficients, a BUS scheme (called D-BUS) is then proposed for outage probability minimization. To verify the reliability of the proposed cooperation strategy with employing the BUS schemes, we theoretically analyze the outage probability as well as diversity orders. It is shown that the proposed cooperation strategy achieves diversity orders equal to the number of multicast users, indicating that the inherent diversity orders offered by the multicast users are fully exploited. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed cooperation strategy and the BUS schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2754261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2754261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048611.pdf","startPage":"7870","endPage":"7889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA-Enabled Cooperative Unicast\u2013Multicast: Design and Outage Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"NOMA-Enabled Cooperative Unicast\u2013Multicast: Design and Outage Analysis","volume":"16","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048611/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415073","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048611/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601347"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"EU FP7 CROWN Project","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-610524"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M600767"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in the Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2017JQ6055"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JB160116"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"NOMA-Enabled Cooperative Unicast\u2013Multicast: Design and Outage Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-ni-2754261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16759S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048611","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048613,"authors":[{"name":"Xiliang Luo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048613/luo-2754490-small.gif","p":["Xiliang Luo (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906) received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","After finishing his Ph.D. studies, he joined Qualcomm Research and carried out cutting edge research at different posts as a Senior Engineer (2006), a Staff Engineer (2010), and then a Senior Staff Engineer (2013), where he was involved in the system designs, analyses, and the standardization of 4G LTE.

To mitigate the interference, it is critical to explore all the allowed avenues to provide more orthogonal resources for the users to transmit non-interfering UL pilots. In this paper, with a realistic massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system model, allowing the channels to be both frequency-selective and time-selective, we propose to mitigate the UL pilot contamination through aligning the channel power in multiple domains, i.e., the time, angular, and Doppler domains. First, we show how to align the power-delay profiles of different users so that the pilots sent within one common reference OFDM symbol are orthogonal. Second, we demonstrate our proposed time-varying pilots can asymptotically mitigate the pilot contamination by aligning the Doppler power spectra (DPSs) judiciously even when the UL channels vary with time. Furthermore, in the case of massive MIMO, as the angles of arrival of the UL paths are acquired by the BS, we show the pilot contamination can be reduced or eliminated by jointly aligning the DPSs and the angular power spectra. Extensive computer simulations convince us the proposed Power Aligning principle can serve as the baseline design philosophy for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2754490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048613.pdf","startPage":"7919","endPage":"7935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2754490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aligning Power in Multiple Domains for Pilot Decontamination in Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048613/","displayDocTitle":"Aligning Power in Multiple Domains for Pilot Decontamination in Massive MIMO","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415083","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048613/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ShanghaiTech University","grantNumber":"F-0203-14-008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61461136004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Shanghai Municipality of Science and Technology Commission Key Project","grantNumber":"17511104902"},{"fundingName":"Research Collaboration Fund from Spreadtrum Communications Incorporated"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aligning Power in Multiple Domains for Pilot Decontamination in Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"twc-luo-2754490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084642S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048613","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048631,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Treleaven","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London"],"bio":{"p":["Philip Treleaven is a professor of computing in the Department of Computer Science at University College London.

Therefore, the study on handover is of great importance especially in dense HetNets. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of cross-tier handover from the macro cell tier to the small cell tier, which shows the highest handover failure rate in current standards and industry studies. Using the stochastic geometry, we propose an analytical model for the cross-tier handover processes in the HetNet. Based on the derived analytical model, the closed-form expressions for the key handover performance metrics, including the handover rate, handover failure rate, and ping-pong rate, are deduced as functions of the base station density, time to trigger and user mobility. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and closed-form theoretical analyses, which provide guidance for the deployments of HetNets and corresponding handover strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2754260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2754260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048668.pdf","startPage":"7859","endPage":"7869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analyzing the Cross-Tier Handover in Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analyzing the Cross-Tier Handover in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"16","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048668/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415046","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048668/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471068 and 61325006"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001009-003"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B16006"},{"fundingName":"VINNOVAMOST Eco Innovation Project","grantNumber":"2013-02198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analyzing the Cross-Tier Handover in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-xu-2754260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121682S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048668","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048676,"authors":[{"name":"Chung Le","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048676/le-2753776-small.gif","p":["Chung Le was born in Thanh Hoa, Vietnam, in 1984.

However, this approach encounters various network management challenges, including interference mitigation techniques. In this paper, we consider a multi-user half-duplex amplify-and-forward-MIMO relay system, where a macro basis station communicates with edge cell users via relays and each node has multiple antennas. In this context, we propose two interference alignment (IA) schemes, for which a hybrid approach of the problem formulation based on zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum-mean-square-error optimization criteria was developed to deal with interferences in perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases. In the case of perfect CSI, simulation results show that this approach provides a SNR gain of about 4 dB regarding BER performance in comparison to that achieved by the reference approach, where all filters are determined solely based on ZF criterion. Furthermore, the achieved capacity and effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at each edge node are improved by around 5 dB. Having CSI errors, the system performance is significantly improved using the robust design IA approach by minimizing the expected value of cost functions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2753776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048676.pdf","startPage":"7834","endPage":"7847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2753776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Optimization Approach for Interference Alignment in Multi-User MIMO Relay Networks Under Different CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048676/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Optimization Approach for Interference Alignment in Multi-User MIMO Relay Networks Under Different CSI","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415075","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8048676/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Optimization Approach for Interference Alignment in Multi-User MIMO Relay Networks Under Different CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-le-2753776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084721S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048676","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048677,"authors":[{"name":"Seyeon Yoo","affiliation":["Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8271882/8048677/yoo-2749420-small.gif","p":["Seyeon Yoo (S\u201914) was born in Ulsan, South Korea, in 1992.

The proposed ILFM was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. The 10-MHz phase noise of the 29.25-GHz output signal was -129.7 dBc/Hz, and its variations across temperatures and supply voltages were less than 2 dB.

In this paper, two novel cooperative modes are developed for full duplex D2D communication underlaying cellular networks: the network MU-MIMO based mode (N-mode) and the sequential forwarding mode (S-mode). In the N-mode, two D2D users work as network MIMO to forward the data to cellular users and thus leverage the channel diversity. In the S-mode, the spatial distribution of D2D users and cellular users is explored to improve the transmission rate. Based on these modes, two D2D users share the downlink resources with two nearby cellular users simultaneously to achieve both proximity gain and reuse gain. Moreover, these modes are well suited for edge cellular users. To optimize the performance of the two modes, optimal power allocation is conducted by considering the influence of residual self-interference at full duplex radios and the requirements of the minimum transmission rate for both cellular users and D2D users. Simulation results show that, compared with the dedicated mode, the sum rate of cooperative modes in the perfect self-interference cancellation case can achieve 32% overall improvement and about 70% improvement in the scenario with non-edge D2D users and edge cellular users. With residual self-interference at a full duplex radio, the overall performance improvement is reduced to 15%. However, the cooperative modes can still achieve 40% improvement in the scenario with non-edge D2D users and edge cellular users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Full Duplex Device to Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2753785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048680.pdf","startPage":"7800","endPage":"7815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2753785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Full Duplex Device to Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8048680/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415043","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Research funding"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Full Duplex Device to Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2753785-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11286S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048680","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8048684,"authors":[{"name":"Dalin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8170465/8048684/zhu-2754369-small.gif","p":["Dalin Zhu received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Kansas State University in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

The key ingredient of the proposed method is the custom designed beam pairs, from which there exists an invertible function of the AoD/AoA. A new multi-layer reference signal structure is developed for the proposed method to facilitate angle estimation for wideband channels with dual-polarized antenna elements. To reduce feedback in closed-loop frequency division duplexing systems, a novel differential feedback strategy is proposed to feedback the estimated angle pairs. Numerical results demonstrate that good azimuth/elevation AoD and AoA estimation performance can be achieved under different levels of signal-to-noise ratio, channel conditions, and antenna array configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8170465/08048684.pdf","startPage":"7890","endPage":"7905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2754369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2754369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional AoD and AoA Acquisition for Wideband Millimeter-Wave Systems With Dual-Polarized MIMO","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Structural beams","Radio frequency","Channel estimation","Millimeter wave communication","Wideband","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","direction-of-arrival estimation","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna array configurations","azimuth-elevation AoA estimation","azimuth-elevation AoD estimation","differential feedback strategy","angle-of-departure estimation technique","two-dimensional AoA acquisition","two-dimensional AoD acquisition","multiple-input multiple-output systems","dual-polarized MIMO","wideband millimeter-wave systems","estimated angle pairs","closed-loop frequency division duplexing systems","wideband channels","angle estimation","multilayer reference signal structure","custom designed beam pairs","dual-polarized antenna elements","angle-of-arrival estimation technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","millimeter-wave systems","auxiliary beam pair","two-dimensional AoD/AoA estimation","dual-polarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional AoD and AoA Acquisition for Wideband Millimeter-Wave Systems With Dual-Polarized MIMO","volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/8048684/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17415079","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000140","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Transportation through the Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning, Tier 1 University Transportation Center"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Gift from Huawei Technologies"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korean Government (MSIT; Ministry of Science and ICT)","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1C1B5015222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional AoD and AoA Acquisition for Wideband Millimeter-Wave Systems With Dual-Polarized MIMO","sourcePdf":"twc-heath-2754369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086114S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8170465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8170465","articleId":"8048684","onlineDate":"22 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048711,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Coughlin","affiliation":["Coughlin Associates"],"bio":{"p":["Tom Coughlin (tom@tomcoughlin.com) is the founder of Coughlin Associates.

Therefore, it is important to detect stress and manage it to reduce the risk of damage to an individual's well being. With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), devices can be made to detect stress and manage it effectively by using cloudbased services and smartphone apps to aggregate and compute large data sets that track stress behavior over long periods of time. Additionally, there is added convenience via the connectivity and portability of these IoT devices. They allow individuals to seek intervention prior to elevated health risks and achieve a less stressful life.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962380/8048709/08048734.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCE.2017.2715578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCE.2017.2715578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stress Detection and Management: A Survey of Wearable Smart Health Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Bluetooth","Androids","Humanoid robots","Accelerometers","Internet of Things","Consumer electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","health care","Internet of Things","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stress detection","stress management","wearable smart health devices","Internet of Things","IoT","cloudbased services","smartphone apps","stress behavior","elevated health risks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048734/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Stress Detection and Management: A Survey of Wearable Smart Health Devices","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8048734/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17205503","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress Detection and Management: A Survey of Wearable Smart Health Devices","sourcePdf":"06mce04-thapliyal-2715578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058522S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5962380","isNumber":"8048709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962380","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8048709","articleId":"8048734","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8048836,"authors":[{"name":"Morgen E.

Their intensive computational activity cryptographically secures the virtual currency, approves transactions, and, in the process, creates new bitcoins for the miners, as payment. And it does another thing, too: It uses an absolutely stunning amount of power. The ever-expanding racks of processors used by miners already consume as much electricity as a small city. It's a problem that experts say is bad and getting worse. \"The concern that people continue to debate is, where does this end?\" says Michael Reed, head of blockchain technology for Intel. The Bitcoin leech sucking on the world's power grids has been held in check, so far, by rapid gains in the energy efficiency of mining hardware. But energy and blockchain analysts are worried about the possibility of a perfect storm: Those efficiency gains are slowing while bitcoin value is rising fast-and its potential transaction growth is immense.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bitcoin","Data mining","Hardware","Medical services","Central Processing Unit"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain world","bitcoin","virtual currency","power grids"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048837","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel7/6/8048814/08048837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048837","startPage":"36","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain world - Feeding the blockchain beast if bitcoin ever does go mainstream, the electricity needed to sustain it will be enormous","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blockchain world - Feeding the blockchain beast if bitcoin ever does go mainstream, the electricity needed to sustain it will be enormous","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048837/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2017","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8048837/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","publicationDate":"October 2017","accessionNumber":"17205773","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blockchain world - Feeding the blockchain beast if bitcoin ever does go mainstream, the electricity needed to sustain it will be enormous","sourcePdf":"1017-36BlockchainEnergy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020741S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6","isNumber":"8048814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8048814","articleId":"8048837","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048838,"authors":[{"name":"Morgen E.

But before we remount the entire digital ecosystem on blockchain technology, it would be wise to take stock of what makes the approach unique and what costs are associated with it. Blockchain technology is, in essence, a novel way to manage data. As such, it competes with the data-management systems we already have. Relational databases, which orient information in updatable tables of columns and rows, are the technical foundation of many services we use today. Decades of market exposure and well-funded research by companies like Oracle Corp. have expanded the functionality and hardened the security of relational databases. However, they suffer from one major constraint: They put the task of storing and updating entries in the hands of one or a few entities, whom you have to trust won't mess with the data or get hacked.","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel7/6/8048814/08048838.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain world - Do you need a blockchain?

But constituents are still often frustrated by mounds of paperwork and the snail-like pace of official business. Could a blockchain help? Just as blockchains have shaken up the financial industry and changed our perception of money, some government agencies now believe the technology could rejuvenate the public sector. Proponents argue that its immutability will protect records from fraudsters, its transparency will keep employees accountable, and its ability to automatically process new entries can make agencies more efficient. Such promises have persuaded city, state, and federal governments to launch the first batch of public-sector blockchain experiments. Two of the most enthusiastic early adopters have been the U.S. state of Illinois and the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Or, if you are that neighbor, would you use your solar power to charge a battery and dump that energy back onto the grid at peak hours, when the price was highest? The answers to these questions-which depend on how people would behave in an open energy market-are unknown, because that market does not exist. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs, the two dominant schemes for reimbursing residential energy production, pay out at a fixed rate, effectively decoupling producers from the price signals that might otherwise direct their behavior. But that may be changing. And we may have the blockchain to thank. Multiple projects are now under way to use technology that was originally intended to account for transactions in digital currency to track electricity production and put it up for sale.","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel7/6/8048814/08048842.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2017.8048842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy trading for fun and profit buy your neighbor's rooftop solar power or sell your own-it'll all be on a blockchain","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy trading for fun and profit buy your neighbor's rooftop solar power or sell your own-it'll all be on a blockchain","volume":"54","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17205781","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048842/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048842/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy trading for fun and profit buy your neighbor's rooftop solar power or sell your own-it'll all be on a blockchain","sourcePdf":"1017-56Utilities.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021252S","chronDate":"October  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6","isNumber":"8048814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8048814","articleId":"8048842","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048920,"authors":[{"name":"Orcun Yildiz","affiliation":["Inria Rennes Bretagne-Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Orcun","lastName":"Yildiz","id":"37085738405"},{"name":"Amelie Chi Zhou","affiliation":["Inria Rennes Bretagne-Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Amelie Chi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086126017"},{"name":"Shadi Ibrahim","affiliation":["Inria Rennes Bretagne-Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Shadi","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37683782700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2326-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2327-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"8048920","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eley: On the Effectiveness of Burst Buffers for Big Data Processing in HPC Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048782/8048856/08048920.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048856","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.73","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big Data applications","Prefetching","Interference","Sparks","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","parallel processing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Eley","HPC system","burst buffers","big data processing","data transfer time reduction","I/O interference","prefetching technique","full delay operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HPC","MapReduce","Big Data","Parallel File Systems","Burst Buffers","Interference","Prefetch"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048920","abstract":"Burst Buffer is an effective solution for reducing the data transfer time and the I/O interference in HPC systems.

Existing BBs focus on only intermediate data of Big Data applications and incur a high performance degradation of both Big Data and HPC applications. We present Eley, a burst buffer solution that helps to accelerate the performance of Big Data applications while guaranteeing the performance of HPC applications. In order to improve the performance of Big Data applications, Eley employs a prefetching technique that fetches the input data of these applications to be stored close to computing nodes thus reducing the latency of reading data inputs. Moreover, Eley is equipped with a full delay operator to guarantee the performance of HPC applications - as they are running independently on a HPC system.

Hybrid memory systems can mitigate the scaling limitations of monolithic DRAM by pairing together multiple memory technologies (e.g., different types of DRAM, or DRAM and non-volatile memory) at the same level of the memory hierarchy. The goal of a hybrid main memory is to combine the different advantages of the multiple memory types in a cost-effective manner while avoiding the disadvantages of each technology. Memory pages are placed in and migrated between the different memories within a hybrid memory system, based on the properties of each page. It is important to make intelligent page management (i.e., placement and migration) decisions, as they can significantly affect system performance.In this paper, we propose utility-based hybrid memory management (UH-MEM), a new page management mechanism for various hybrid memories, that systematically estimates the utility (i.e., the system performance benefit) of migrating a page between different memory types, and uses this information to guide data placement. UH-MEM operates in two steps. First, it estimates how much a single application would benefit from migrating one of its pages to a different type of memory, by comprehensively considering access frequency, row buffer locality, and memory-level parallelism. Second, it translates the estimated benefit of a single application to an estimate of the overall system performance benefit from such a migration.We evaluate the effectiveness of UH-MEM with various types of hybrid memories, and show that it significantly improves system performance on each of these hybrid memories. For a memory system with DRAM and non-volatile memory, UH-MEM improves performance by 14% on average (and up to 26%) compared to the best of three evaluated state-of-the-art mechanisms across a large number of data-intensive workloads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048927/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17207613","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048927/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Utility-Based Hybrid Memory Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-Based Hybrid Memory Management","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.187368S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8048927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048936,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehyun Han","affiliation":["Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Jaehyun","lastName":"Han","id":"37086153767"},{"name":"Donghun Koo","affiliation":["Korea Aerospace University"],"firstName":"Donghun","lastName":"Koo","id":"37086061488"},{"name":"Glenn K.

Burst buffers are commonly located between parallel file systems and compute nodes, handling bursty I/Os in the middle. In this architecture, burst buffers are shared resources. The performance of an SSD is significantly reduced when it is used excessively because of garbage collection, and we have observed that SSDs in a burst buffer become slow when many users simultaneously use the burst buffer. To mitigate the performance problem, we propose a new user-level I/O isolation framework in a High-Performance Computing environment using a multi-streamed SSD. The multi-streamed SSD allocates the same flash block for I/Os in the same stream. We assign a different stream to each user; thus, the user can use the stream exclusively. To evaluate the performance, we have used open-source supercomputing workloads and I/O traces from real workloads in the Cori supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. Via user-level I/O isolation, we have obtained up to a 125% performance improvement in terms of I/O throughput. In addition, our approach reduces the write amplification in the SSDs, leading to improved SSD endurance. This user-level I/O isolation framework could be applied to deployed burst buffers without having to make any user interface changes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048936/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17213401","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048936/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating a Burst Buffer Via User-Level I/O Isolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating a Burst Buffer Via User-Level I/O Isolation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095385S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8048936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8048941,"authors":[{"name":"Daeyoun Kang","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Daeyoun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086054236"},{"name":"Tae Joon Jun","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Tae Joon","lastName":"Jun","id":"37085878462"},{"name":"Dohyeun Kim","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dohyeun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086052211"},{"name":"Jaewook Kim","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jaewook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086057158"},{"name":"Daeyoung Kim","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085462808"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2326-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2327-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"8048941","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1050},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Containers","Virtualization","Memory management","Parallel processing","Hardware","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","graphics processing units","middleware","operating systems (computers)","parallel processing","scheduling","storage management","system recovery","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ConVGPU","GPU management middleware","container based virtualized environment","Graphics Processing Unit","general-purpose high-performance computing","parallel computing","GPU memory management","program failure","deadlock situation","scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CUDA","Docker","GPGPU","virtualization"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is essential for general-purpose high-performance computing, because of its dominant performance in parallel computing compare to that of CPU.

However, most of these trials did not consider sharing GPU among multiple containers. Without the above consideration, a system will experience a program failure or a deadlock situation in the worst case. In this paper, we propose ConVGPU, a solution to share the GPU in multiple containers. With ConVGPU, the system can guarantee the required GPU memory which the container needs to execute. To achieve it, we introduce four scheduling algorithms that manage the GPU memory to be taken by the containers. These algorithms can prevent the system from falling into deadlock situations between containers during execution.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.17","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048782/8048856/08048941.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ConVGPU: GPU Management Middleware in Container Based Virtualized Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048941/","displayDocTitle":"ConVGPU: GPU Management Middleware in Container Based Virtualized Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17213373","htmlLink":"/document/8048941/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ConVGPU: GPU Management Middleware in Container Based Virtualized Environment","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099506S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8048941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8048944,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Azimi","affiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Azimi","id":"37589405700"},{"name":"Tyler Fox","affiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI"],"firstName":"Tyler","lastName":"Fox","id":"37086083663"},{"name":"Sherief Reda","affiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI"],"firstName":"Sherief","lastName":"Reda","id":"37273669500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2326-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2327-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"8048944","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Acceleration","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","graphics processing units","microprocessor chips","network interfaces","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile systems","heterogeneous integration","CPU cores","GPGPU cores","network accelerators","Mont-Blanc project","prototype ARM cluster","CPU performance","GPGPU acceleration","energy efficiency","Nvidia Jetson TX1 boards","GPGPU performance","CPU-GPGPU balance","server-class ARM SoCs","GPGPU-Accelerated SoC","ARM clusters","network connectivity","network interface cards","mobile-class SoC","mobile servers","ARM-based cluster organization","GPGPU-accelerated workloads","roofline model","ARM-based servers","branch predictor","L2 cache","server-class ARM SoC","storage capacity 10 Gbit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPGPU acceleration","energy efficiency","ARM computing","distributed systems"]}],"abstract":"The last few years saw the emergence of 64-bit ARM SoCs targeted for mobile systems and servers. Mobile-class SoCs rely on the heterogeneous integration of a mix of CPU cores, GPGPU cores, and accelerators, whereas server-class SoCs instead rely on integrating a larger number of CPU cores with no GPGPU support and a number of network accelerators. Previous works, such as the Mont-Blanc project, built their prototype ARM cluster out of mobile-class SoCs and compared their work against x86 solutions. These works mainly focused on the CPU performance. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM-based cluster organization that exploits faster network connectivity and GPGPU acceleration to improve the performance and energy efficiency of the cluster. Our custom cluster, based on Nvidia Jetson TX1 boards, is equipped with 10Gb network interface cards and enables us to study the characteristics, scalability challenges, and programming models of GPGPU-accelerated workloads. We also develop an extension to the Roofline model to establish a visually intuitive performance model for the proposed cluster organization. We compare the GPGPU performance of our cluster with discrete GPGPUs. We demonstrate that our cluster improves both the performance and energy efficiency of workloads that scale well and can leverage the better CPU-GPGPU balance of our cluster. We contrast the CPU performance of our cluster with ARM-based servers that use many CPU cores. Our results show the poor performance of the branch predictor and L2 cache are the bottleneck of server-class ARM SoCs. Furthermore, we elucidate the impact of using 10Gb connectivity with mobile systems instead of traditional, 1Gb connectivity.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.86","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048782/8048856/08048944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048856","startPage":"333","endPage":"343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Role of GPGPU-Accelerated SoC-Based ARM Clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Role of GPGPU-Accelerated SoC-Based ARM Clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048944/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17207583","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048944/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Role of GPGPU-Accelerated SoC-Based ARM Clusters","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084745S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8048944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8048963,"authors":[{"name":"Matthieu Dreher","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Dreher","id":"37086016605"},{"name":"Kiran Sasikumar","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Sasikumar","id":"37086015933"},{"name":"Subramanian Sankaranarayanan","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Subramanian","lastName":"Sankaranarayanan","id":"37086012107"},{"name":"Tom Peterka","affiliation":["Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Peterka","id":"37295026400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2326-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2327-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"8048963","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Analytical models","Libraries","Adaptation models","Data models","Communication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","data visualisation","interactive systems","materials science computing","message passing","parallel processing","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous task communication","communication channel","Manala","flexible flow control library","flow control policy","buffering mechanisms","scientific workflows","software infrastructures","FIFO policy","message flow management","materials science","LAMMPS","synthetic diffraction analysis code","interactive visualization","Gromacs","asynchronous checkpoint"]}],"abstract":"Tasks coupled in an in situ workflow may not process data at the same speed, potentially causing overflows in the communication channel between them. To prevent this problem, software infrastructures for in situ workflows usually impose a strict FIFO policy that has the side-effect of slowing down faster tasks to the speed of the slower ones. This may not be the desired behavior; for example, a scientist may prefer to drop older data in the communication channel in order to visualize the latest snapshot of a simulation. In this paper, we present Manala, a flexible flow control library designed to manage the flow of messages between a producer and a consumer in an in situ workflow. Manala intercepts messages from the producer, stores them, and selects the message to forward to the consumer depending on the flow control policy. The library is designed to ease the creation of new flow control policies and buffering mechanisms. We demonstrate with three examples how changing the flow control policy between tasks can influence the performance and results of scientific workflows.

The problem sizes of these applications are limited by the GPU device memory capacity, which is typically smaller than the host memory. On GPU supercomputers, a locality improvement technique using temporal blocking method with memory swapping between host and device enables large computation beyond the device memory capacity. However, because the loop management of temporal blocking with data movement across these memories increase programming difficulty, the applying this methodology to the real stencil applications demands substantially higher programming cost. Our high-productivity stencil framework automatically applies temporal blocking to boundary exchange required for stencil computation and supports automatic memory swapping provided by a MPI/CUDA wrapper library. The framework-based application for the airflow in an urban city maintains 80% performance even with the twice larger than the GPU memory capacity and have demonstrated good weak scalability on the

However, the computation-intensive convolutional layers and memory-intensive fully connected layers have brought many challenges to the implementation of CNN on embedded platforms. To overcome this problem, this work proposes a power-efficient accelerator for CNNs, and different methods are applied to optimize the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. For the convolutional layer, the accelerator first rearranges the input features into matrix on-the-fly when storing them to the on-chip buffers. Thus the computation of convolutional layer can be completed through matrix multiplication. For the fully connected layer, the batch-based method is used to reduce the required memory bandwidth, which also can be completed through matrix multiplication. Then a two-layer pipelined computation method for matrix multiplication is proposed to increase the throughput. As a case study, we implement a widely used CNN model, LeNet-5, on an embedded device. It can achieve a peak performance of 34.48 GOP/s and the power efficiency with the value of 19.45 GOP/s/W under 100MHz clock frequency which outperforms previous approaches.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048782/8048856/08048986.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power-Efficient Accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.47","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8048986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Power-Efficient Accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17213404","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8048986/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power-Efficient Accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081747S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8048986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049010,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Pawelczak","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, Bristol, GB"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pawelczak","id":"37086051327"},{"name":"Simon McIntosh-Smith","affiliation":["HPC Group, University of Bristol Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"McIntosh-Smith","id":"37085566285"},{"name":"James Price","affiliation":["HPC Group, University of Bristol Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Price","id":"37085736974"},{"name":"Matt Martineau","affiliation":["HPC Group, University of Bristol Bristol, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Martineau","id":"37085836973"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2326-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2327-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"8049010","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Error correction codes","Random access memory","Hardware","Memory management","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","error correction codes","matrix multiplication","parallel processing","reliability","software fault tolerance","software performance evaluation","sparse matrices","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse matrices","data corruptions","ABFT techniques","sparse matrix solver-based application","Fault Tolerance techniques","high-performance computing systems","exascale computing","soft errors","bit corruptions","hardware Error Correcting Codes","data structures","Mean Time Between Failures","ful sparse matrix solver protection","power overhead","memory overhead","bandwidth overhead","storage overhead","dense vectors","TeaLeaf","heat conduction miniapp","Mantevo Project","HPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exascale","Fault Tolerance","Linear Sparse Matrix Solvers","Resilience"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049010","abstract":"The continuous growth of high-performance computing (HPC) systems has lead to Fault Tolerance (FT) being identified as one of the major challenges for exascale computing, due to the expected decrease in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). One source of faults are soft errors, which can cause bit corruptions to the data held in memory. Current solutions for protection against these errors include hardware Error Correcting Codes (ECC), which incur overheads in power, memory bandwidth and storage, while also introducing more complexity to the hardware. In this paper we demonstrate Application-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) as an alternative method of protecting sparse matrices and dense vectors from data corruptions, requiring no additional dedicated memory storage. We use TeaLeaf, a heat conduction miniapp from the Mantevo Project, to demonstrate how these ABFT techniques can be adapted and applied to a sparse matrix solver-based application and its underlying data structures in order to improve reliability and performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048856","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048782/8048856/08049010.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2017.49","startPage":"733","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Based Fault Tolerance Techniques for Fully Protecting Sparse Matrix Solvers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049010/","displayDocTitle":"Application-Based Fault Tolerance Techniques for Fully Protecting Sparse Matrix Solvers","htmlLink":"/document/8049010/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17207590","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Based Fault Tolerance Techniques for Fully Protecting Sparse Matrix Solvers","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"2326a733.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090034S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048782","isNumber":"8048856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048782","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8048856","articleId":"8049010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8049171,"authors":[{"name":"Zijad Kurtanovi\u0107","affiliation":["University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Zijad","lastName":"Kurtanovi\u0107","id":"37085664005"},{"name":"Walid Maalej","affiliation":["University of Hamburg Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Walid","lastName":"Maalej","id":"37322593600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3191-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3192-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6441"}],"articleNumber":"8049171","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049171","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Usability","Security","Feature extraction","Vegetation","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","meta data","pattern classification","support vector machines","systems analysis","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonfunctional requirements","supervised machine learning","RE17 data challenge","performance requirements","classifiers","Support Vector Machine classifier algorithm","security","meta-data","automatically requirements classification","quality attributes","lexical features","syntactical features","sampling strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Requirements","Classification","Machine Learning","Imbalanced Data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RE.2017.82","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048783/8048874/08049171.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","startPage":"490","endPage":"495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2017.82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically Classifying Functional and Non-functional Requirements Using Supervised Machine Learning","abstract":"In this paper, we take up the second RE17 data challenge: the identification of requirements types using the \"Quality attributes (NFR)\" dataset provided.

We developed and evaluated a supervised machine learning approach employing meta-data, lexical, and syntactical features. We employed under-and over-sampling strategies to handle the imbalanced classes in the dataset and cross-validated the classifiers using precision, recall, and F1 metrics in a series of experiments based on the Support Vector Machine classifier algorithm. We achieve a precision and recall up to ~92% for automatically identifying FRs and NFRs. For the identification of specific NFRs, we achieve the highest precision and recall for security and performance NFRs with ~92% precision and ~90% recall. We discuss the most discriminating features of FRs and NFRs as well as the sampling strategies used with an additional dataset and their impact on the classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049171/","accessionNumber":"17207692","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049171/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatically Classifying Functional and Non-functional Requirements Using Supervised Machine Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatically Classifying Functional and Non-functional Requirements Using Supervised Machine Learning","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3191a490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076429S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048783","isNumber":"8048874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048783","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8048874","articleId":"8049171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8049173,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Ferrari","affiliation":["ISTI-CNR Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"38498987600"},{"name":"Giorgio Oronzo Spagnolo","affiliation":["ISTI-CNR Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio Oronzo","lastName":"Spagnolo","id":"37085383255"},{"name":"Stefania Gnesi","affiliation":["ISTI-CNR Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Gnesi","id":"37282428500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3191-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3192-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-6441"}],"articleNumber":"8049173","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1401},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Terminology","Vocabulary","XML","Companies","Requirements engineering","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","natural language processing","text analysis","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PURE","public requirements documents","PUblic REquirements dataset","natural language processing tasks","requirements engineering","abstraction identification","document structure assessment","requirements categorisation","requirements jargon","natural language requirements documents","common XML format","NLP experiments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Requirements Dataset","PURE","Natural Language Requirements","NLP","NLP Tasks","Public Requirements","Requirements Abstraction","Requirements Ambiguity Detection","Requirements Categorisation","Model Synthesis","XML","Empirical Software Engineering","Empirical Studies"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents PURE (PUblic REquirements dataset), a dataset of 79 publicly available natural language requirements documents collected from the Web.

It can be further annotated to work as a benchmark for other tasks, such as ambiguity detection, requirements categorisation and identification of equivalent re-quirements. In the paper, we present the dataset and we compare its language with generic English texts, showing the peculiarities of the requirements jargon, made of a restricted vocabulary of domain-specific acronyms and words, and long sentences. We also present the common XML format to which we have manually ported a subset of the documents, with the goal of facilitating replication of NLP experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PURE: A Dataset of Public Requirements Documents","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","doi":"10.1109/RE.2017.29","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048783/8048874/08049173.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2017.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"PURE: A Dataset of Public Requirements Documents","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049173/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17207677","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PURE: A Dataset of Public Requirements Documents","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3191a502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047515S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048783","isNumber":"8048874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048783","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8048874","articleId":"8049173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049175,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep K.

Crowd RE scales RE by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd RE, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd RE process, itself, by facilitating novel workflows combining crowd and machine intelligence.To facilitate automated techniques for Crowd RE, first, we showcase a crowd-acquired dataset, consisting of requirements and their ratings on multiple dimensions for the smart homes application domain. Our dataset is unique in that it contains not only requirements, but also the characteristics of the crowd workers who produced those requirements including their demographics, personality traits, and creative potential. Understanding the crowd characteristics is essential to developing effective Crowd RE processes. Second, we outline key challenges involved in automating Crowd RE and describe, how our dataset can serve as a foundation for developing such automated techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Automating Crowd RE","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","doi":"10.1109/RE.2017.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048783/8048874/08049175.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RE.2017.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8048874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Toward Automating Crowd RE","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049175/","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17207666","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Automating Crowd RE","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"3191a512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063938S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048783","isNumber":"8048874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048783","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8048874","articleId":"8049175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049186,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel M.

capacity and spectral efficiency of current solutions. The worldwide mobile data traffic increased 4000-fold over the last decade, and is forecast a 7-fold increase between 2016 and 2021. To cope with these stringent demands, prospective solutions are millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology and ultradense small cell networks, given that today most of the mobile traffic is offloaded from mobile networks, i.e., most of mobile users are connected to fixed networks. In addition, enabled by the fast development of electronics, digital signal processing has become essential to enhance the capacity and the performance of current communication systems. In this paper, by using the benefits of multiband modulation schemes and independent sideband (ISB) modulation, high-speed mmWave wireless transmissions in the D-band (110-170 GHz) are reported. D-band radio frequency carrier is generated by means of optical heterodyning, and ISB modulation is applied by means of the Hilbert transform and a double-nested Mach-Zehnder modulator. Total data rates up to 352 Gb/s and spectral efficiencies up to 7.7 bit/s/Hz are experimentally achieved in a single 2 \u00d7 2 multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2756089","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8290594/08049260.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2756089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8290594","startPage":"587","endPage":"593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Carrier Dual-Polarization 328-Gb/s Wireless Transmission in a D-Band Millimeter Wave 2 \u00d7 2 MU-MIMO Radio-Over-Fiber System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Carrier Dual-Polarization 328-Gb/s Wireless Transmission in a D-Band Millimeter Wave 2 \u00d7 2 MU-MIMO Radio-Over-Fiber System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17595733","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8049260/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Carrier Dual-Polarization 328-Gb/s Wireless Transmission in a D-Band Millimeter Wave 2 \u00d7 2 MU-MIMO Radio-Over-Fiber System","sourcePdf":"jlt-puerta-2756089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100803S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8290594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8290594","articleId":"8049260","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049261,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Kang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049261/kang-2756079-small.gif","p":["Kang Kang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China in 2012, and the M.S. degree in telecommunication from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2014.

The information and energy are transferred simultaneously in downlink direction. For MTC networks, most devices only receive several bits control data from AP in downlink transmission. So it is possible to utilize part of the received power to execute energy harvesting provided that the transmission reliability is guaranteed. Since we assume that all devices are without power supply or battery, the power of uplink transmission is entirely from energy harvesting. After converting electromagnetic wave to electricity, the devices are able to transmit their measured and collected data in uplink. Based on these considerations, a non-cooperative game model is formulated and a utility function involving both downlink decoding signal to noise ratio (SNR) and uplink throughput is established. The existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) in the formulated game model is proved. The uniqueness of NE is discussed and the expected NE is selected based on fairness equilibrium selection mechanism. The optimal splitting ratio within the feasible set, which maximizes the utility function, is obtained by an iterative function derived from this utility function. The numerical results show that in addition to ensuring the downlink decoding SNR and maximizing uplink throughput of an individual device, our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of system performance.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049261.pdf","startPage":"20124","endPage":"20134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756079","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756079","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049261","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Downlink","Games","Throughput","Game theory","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","energy harvesting","game theory","iterative methods","radio links","radio networks","radiofrequency power transmission","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power splitting","future wireless powered MTC networks","machine type communication","hybrid access point","AP","wearable devices","energy harvesting","NE","optimal splitting ratio","wireless power transfer","constant power supply communication","sensors","downlink transmission reliability","electromagnetic wave","noncooperative game model","downlink decoding","signal to noise ratio","SNR","Nash equilibrium","fairness equilibrium selection mechanism","iterative function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless power transfer","machine type communication","game theory","Nash equilibrium","power splitting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Game-Theory-Based Distributed Power Splitting for Future Wireless Powered MTC Networks","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17515815","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049261/","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Game-Theory-Based Distributed Power Splitting for Future Wireless Powered MTC Networks","sourcePdf":"access-kang-2756079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129822S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049261","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8049264,"authors":[{"name":"Yufei Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049264/liu-2756102-small.gif","p":["Yufei Liu received the M.S. degree in computer science from the College of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Northwest University for Nationalities, China, in 2009.

People often simultaneously appear in multiple social networks that can provide complementary services. Thus, knowledge from different social networks can help overcome the data sparseness problem. However, the knowledge cannot be directly obtained due to that they are from different social networks. To solve this problem, we construct an adaptive model to learn user distance in multiple social networks via combining distance metric learning and boosting technologies. The basic idea of our model is to embed related social networks into a potential feature space, while retaining the topologies of social networks. To get the solution to our model, we formulate it as a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we propose an adaptive user distance measure algorithm whose time complexity is linear with the number of the links. We verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our model on the link prediction problem. Experiments on two real large-scale data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared methods. To the best of our knowledge, the joint learning of metric learning with boosting is first studied in multiple social networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049264/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17266546","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Metric Learning Combining With Boosting for User Distance Measure in Multiple Social Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1433116 and 61702355"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"NP2017208"},{"fundingName":"Funding of Jiangsu Innovation Program for Graduate Education","grantNumber":"KYLX15_0324 and KYLX15_0321"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Metric Learning Combining With Boosting for User Distance Measure in Multiple Social Networks","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2756102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09199S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049264","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049266,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Pastor-Graells","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Juan Pastor-Graells received the Physics degree from the University\n of Valencia, Valencia, Spain, in 2013, and the Master's degree in advanced electronics systems, in 2014, from the\n University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Photonics Engineering\n Group since 2013.

This new sensing technology, known as chirped-pulse \u03a6OTDR, had a maximum reported sensing range of 11 km. In this paper, a 75-km sensing range with 10-m spatial resolution is demonstrated by using bidirectional first-order Raman amplification. The system is capable of performing truly linear, single-shot measurements of strain perturbations with an update rate of 1-kHz and 1-n\u03b5 resolution. The time-domain trace of the sensor exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the worst point of >3 dB, allowing to monitor vibrations up to 500 Hz with remarkable accuracy. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system, we apply <;100 n\u03b5 vibrations in the noisiest point of the fiber, with a frequency modulated from 70 to 150 Hz over a period of 10 s. The results obtained in these conditions demonstrate a vibration detection SNR of >20 dB (with only 300-ms analysis window and no postprocessing) and no evidence of nonlinearity in the acoustic response. The optical nonlinear effects that the probe pulse could suffer along the sensing fiber are thoroughly studied, paying special attention to potential distortions of the pulse shape, particularly in its instantaneous frequency profile. Our analysis reveals that, for proper values of peak power, the pulse does not suffer any major.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049266/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"17243688","volume":"35","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Chirped-Pulse Phase-Sensitive Reflectometer Assisted by First-Order Raman Amplification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"307441"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"608099"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad (MINECO)","grantNumber":"TEC2013-45265-R and TEC2015-71127-C2-2-R"},{"fundingName":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (DOMINO)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"MSCA-ITN-ETN-722509"},{"fundingName":"Consejer\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n, Juventud y Deporte"},{"fundingName":"Comunidad de Madrid","grantNumber":"S2013/MIT-2790"},{"fundingName":"Spanish MINECO"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chirped-Pulse Phase-Sensitive Reflectometer Assisted by First-Order Raman Amplification","sourcePdf":"jlt-pastorgraells-2756558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065332S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8067628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8067628","articleId":"8049266","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049272,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc Phuc Le","affiliation":["Institute of Fundamental and Applied Sciences, Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Ngoc Phuc","lastName":"Le","orcid":"0000-0002-0236-2086","id":"38260750000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8049272","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":464},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Lead","Resource management","Fading channels","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","telecommunication power management","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple transmitters","time division multiple access","Nakagami-m random variables","closed-form approximated expression","power-beacon-assisted energy harvesting wireless systems","nonidentical Nakagami-m fading channels","distributed power-beacon","wireless powered communication network","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","power-beacon","throughput","TDMA","Nakagami-m fading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8334015/08049272.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2756053","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2756053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis of Power-Beacon-Assisted Energy Harvesting Wireless Systems Over Non-Identical Nakagami-- Fading Channels","abstract":"We consider a distributed power-beacon (PB)-assisted wireless powered communication network that consists of multiple PBs, multiple transmitters, and one receiver.

To protect the identities of users, attribute-based encryption (ABE) was presented by Sahai et al. ABE has been widely used in many scenarios, particularly in cloud computing. In this paper, public key encryption with equality test is concatenated with key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) to present KP-ABE with equality test (KP-ABEwET). The proposed scheme not only offers fine-grained authorization of ciphertexts but also protects the identities of users. In contrast to ABE with keyword search, KP-ABEwET can test whether the ciphertexts encrypted by different public keys contain the same information. Moreover, the authorization process of the presented scheme is more flexible than that of Ma et al.'s scheme. Furthermore, the proposed scheme achieves one-way against chosen-ciphertext attack based on the bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption. In addition, a new computational problem called the twin-decision BDH problem (tDBDH) is proposed in this paper. tDBDH is proved to be as hard as the decisional BDH problem. Finally, for the first time, the security model of authorization is provided, and the security of authorization based on the tDBDH assumption is proven in the random oracle model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Authorization","Cloud computing","Public key","Keyword search"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud

However, once the number of residue errors is beyond half the minimum distance of the code, the unique decoding may fail and lead to a large reconstruction error. In this brief, assuming that all the residues are allowed to have errors with small degrees, we consider how to reconstruct the polynomial as accurately as possible in the sense that a reconstructed polynomial is obtained with only the last \u03c4 number of coefficients being possibly erroneous, when the residues are affected by errors with degrees upper bounded by \u03c4. In this regard, we first propose a multi-level robust Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials, namely, a tradeoff between the dynamic range of the degree of the polynomial to be reconstructed and the residue error bound \u03c4 is formulated. Furthermore, a simple closed-form reconstruction algorithm is also proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2756343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2756343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08049289.pdf","startPage":"1778","endPage":"1782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Polynomial Reconstruction via Chinese Remainder Theorem in the Presence of Small Degree Residue Errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Polynomial Reconstruction via Chinese Remainder Theorem in the Presence of Small Degree Residue Errors","volume":"65","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049289/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18194613","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049289/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Polynomial Reconstruction via Chinese Remainder Theorem in the Presence of Small Degree Residue Errors","sourcePdf":"tcsii-xiao-2756343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065325S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8513902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8513902","articleId":"8049289","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049291,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Shi","affiliation":["Ningbo University, Ningbo, China","College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ge Shi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation and the M.S. degree in detection technology and automation from China Jiliang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with Ningbo University.

Recently, Hou and Kumar provided a novel framework for analyzing and designing delay-guaranteed wireless networking solutions. While inspiring, their idle-time-based analysis applies only to flows with a special traffic pattern called the frame-synchronized setting. The problem remains largely open for general traffic patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a general framework that characterizes and achieves the complete delay-constrained capacity region with general traffic patterns in single-hop downlink access-point wireless networks. We first show that the timely wireless flow problem is fundamentally an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we judiciously combine different simplification methods to prove that the timely capacity region can be characterized by a finite-size convex polygon. This for the first time allows us to characterize the timely capacity region of wireless flows with general traffic patterns. We then design three scheduling policies to optimize network utility and/or support feasible timely throughput vectors for general traffic patterns. The first policy achieves the optimal network utility and supports any feasible timely throughput vector but suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second and third policies are inspired by our MDP framework and are of much lower complexity. Simulation results show that both achieve near-optimal performance and outperform other existing alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2017.2749513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/8214923/08049295.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2017.2749513","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"3473","endPage":"3486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timely Wireless Flows With General Traffic Patterns: Capacity Region and Scheduling Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049295","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/90/8214923/8049295-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Timely Wireless Flows With General Traffic Patterns: Capacity Region and Scheduling Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049295/","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8049295/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17447695","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1407603, CCF-1422997 and CCF-1618475"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001839","fundingName":"University Grants Committee, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"2150871"},{"fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Committee, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"14201014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Timely Wireless Flows With General Traffic Patterns: Capacity Region and Scheduling Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tnet-deng-2749513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137317S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"8214923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8214923","articleId":"8049295","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":8049299,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hyun Oh","affiliation":["Department of Semiconductor and Display Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8119588/8049299/oh-2750702-small.gif","p":["Chang-Hyun Oh (S\u201917) received the B.S. degree in semiconductor system engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Semiconductor and Display Engineering.","He had an internship program with Samsung Electronics, Inc., Hwasung, South Korea, in 2014.

As the number of memory cells per area increases, so does the possibility of having defects in the memory cells. Therefore, built-in redundancy analysis (BIRA) is widely used for memory test and repair. BIRA repairs faulty cells by replacing them with healthy spare cells. To perform BIRA, the faulty memory cell information is required and is collected via a memory test. By using the faulty cell information, BIRA can analyze and perform the repair by assigning spares to defective cells. However, it requires extra hardware to store the faulty cell information. Most conventional BIRA approaches utilize content-addressable memories (CAMs) to store faulty cell information. Owing to the CAMs' fast access speed, the repair time can be reduced. However, CAMs are the critical source of an area overhead for BIRA, and a CAM could be shared across multiple memory banks. The shared structure limits simultaneous repair operations for the banks, and when the CAM is faulty, the conventional CAM-based BIRA cannot be performed. This paper proposes a new BIRA method, which does not require extra memory and instead utilizes a fault-free memory region to store the faulty cell information. Because extra memory is not required in the proposed BIRA method, the area overhead is decreased. The proposed hierarchical repair algorithm thus helps to reduce the analysis time, while achieving optimal normalized repair rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"17390378","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049299/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BIRA With Optimal Repair Rate Using Fault-Free Memory Region for Area Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058856"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (10080594) and KSRC (Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium) support program for the development of the future semiconductor device"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BIRA With Optimal Repair Rate Using Fault-Free Memory Region for Area Reduction","sourcePdf":"tcsi-oh-2750702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058222S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8119588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8119588","articleId":"8049299","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049301,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8552518/8049301/li-2737781-small.gif","p":["Ke Li (M\u201917) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science and technology from Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2014.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, and a Research Fellow with the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K. He is currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Data Analytics with the Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K. He has served as a regular reviewer and has published several research papers in renowned journals, such as the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation and the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics.

There are a number of metrics for evaluating the performance of a multiobjective optimizer that approximates the whole Pareto-optimal front. However, for evaluating the quality of a preferred subset of the whole front, the existing metrics are inadequate. In this paper, we suggest a systematic way to adapt the existing metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of a preference-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm using reference points. The basic idea is to preprocess the preferred solution set according to a multicriterion decision making approach before using a regular metric for performance assessment. Extensive experiments on several artificial scenarios, and benchmark problems fully demonstrate its effectiveness in evaluating the quality of different preferred solution sets with regard to various reference points supplied by a decision maker.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18285748","htmlLink":"/document/8049301/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"R-Metric: Evaluating the Performance of Preference-Based Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Using Reference Points","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K001523/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61329302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"R-Metric: Evaluating the Performance of Preference-Based Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Using Reference Points","sourcePdf":"tevc-li-2737781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136653S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8552518","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8552518","articleId":"8049301","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049302,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Sadrfaridpour","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/8401732/8049302/sadrf-2748386-small.gif","p":["Behzad Sadrfaridpour (S\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Tabriz University, Tabriz, Iran, and the University of Tarbiat Modares, Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Utilizing such robots with the new human-robot interaction (HRI) functionality to interact closely and effectively with a human co-worker, we propose a novel framework for integrating HRI factors (both physical and social interactions) into the robot motion controller for human-robot collaborative assembly tasks in a manufacturing hybrid cell. To meet human physical demands in such assembly tasks, an optimal control problem is formulated for physical HRI (pHRI)-based robot motion control to keep pace with human motion progress. We further augment social HRI (sHRI) into the framework by considering a computational model of the human worker's trust in his/her robot partner as well as robot facial expressions. The human worker's trust in robot is computed and used as a metric for path selection as well as a constraint in the optimal control problem. Robot facial expression is displayed for providing additional visual feedbacks to the human worker. We evaluate the proposed framework by designing a robotic experimental testbed and conducting a comprehensive study with a human-in-the-loop. Results of this paper show that compared to the manual adjustments of robot velocity, an autonomous controller based on pHRI, pHRI and sHRI with trust, or pHRI and sHRI with trust, and emotion result in 34%, 39%, and 44% decrease in human workload and 21%, 32%, and 60% increase in robot's usability, respectively. Compared to the manual framework, human trust in robot increases by 38% and 42%, respectively, in the latter two autonomous frameworks.

In this paper, denial-of-service (DoS) attack scheduling is investigated in depth. Specifically, we consider a system where a remote estimator receives the data packet sent by a sensor over a wireless network at each time instant, and an energy-constrained attacker that cannot launch DoS attacks all the time designs the optimal DoS attack scheduling to maximize the attacking effect on the remote estimation performance. Most of the existing works concerning DoS attacks focus on the ideal scenario in which data packets can be received successfully if there is no DoS attack. To capture the unreliability nature of practical networks, we study the packet-dropping network in which packet dropouts may occur even in the absence of attack. We derive the optimal attack scheduling scheme that maximizes the average expected estimation error, and the one which maximizes the expected terminal estimation error over packet-dropping networks. We also present some countermeasures against DoS attacks, and discuss the optimal defense strategy, and how the optimal attack schedule can serve for more effective and resource-saving countermeasures. We further investigate the optimal attack schedule with multiple sensors.

Due to the existence of dust-like particles in water medium, underwater images are vulnerable to the effect of low contrast and color cast. In this paper, we propose a novel underwater image restoration method based on a non-local prior, namely, adaptive attenuation-curve prior. This prior relies on the statistical distribution of pixel values. That is, all pixel values of a clear image can be partitioned into several hundred distinct clusters in RGB space, and the pixel values in each cluster will be distributed on a curve with a power function form after attenuated by water in varying degrees. Specifically, we can estimate the transmission for each pixel according to its distribution on the curves. Then, we estimate the attenuation factor to compensate for the transmission. To prevent over saturation and reduce the noise of the recovered images, we propose the saturation constraints to adjust the transmission of the three color channels. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better performance, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our proposed method can be further extended to restore other kinds of degraded images, such as hazy images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"65","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17581472","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8049307/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Single Underwater Image Restoration Using Adaptive Attenuation-Curve Prior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Underwater Image Restoration Using Adaptive Attenuation-Curve Prior","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chau-2751671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068239S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8293879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8293879","articleId":"8049307","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049308,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Karamanakos","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8350354/8049308/karam-2756092-small.gif","p":["Petros Karamanakos (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the Diploma\n and the Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Athens,\n Greece, in 2007, and 2013, respectively.","From 2010 to 2011, he was in the ABB Corporate Research Center, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland, where he worked on\n model predictive control strategies for medium-voltage drives.

In this paper we show how the interplay between mutation and crossover can make GAs hillclimb faster than their mutation-only counterparts. We devise a Markov chain framework that allows to rigorously prove an upper bound on the runtime of standard steady state GAs to hillclimb the OneMax function. The bound establishes that the steady-state GAs are 25% faster than all standard bit mutation-only evolutionary algorithms with static mutation rate up to lower order terms for moderate population sizes. The analysis also suggests that larger populations may be faster than populations of size 2. We present a lower bound for a greedy (2 + 1) GA that matches the upper bound for populations larger than 2, rigorously proving that two individuals cannot outperform larger population sizes under greedy selection and greedy crossover up to lower order terms. In complementary experiments the best population size is greater than 2 and the greedy GAs are faster than standard ones, further suggesting that the derived lower bound also holds for the standard steady state (2 + 1) GA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18115142","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8049309/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Standard Steady State Genetic Algorithms Can Hillclimb Faster Than Mutation-Only Evolutionary Algorithms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M004252/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Standard Steady State Genetic Algorithms Can Hillclimb Faster Than Mutation-Only Evolutionary Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tevc-oliveto-2745715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125234S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8478014","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8478014","articleId":"8049309","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":8049314,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuoli Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8595470/8049314/zhao-2752640-small.gif","p":["Zhuoli Zhao (S\u201915\u2013M\u201918) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2010 and 2017, respectively.","From 2014 to 2015, he was a visiting Ph.D. student (Sponsored Researcher) with the Control and Power Research Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K. He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou.

It is expected that future distribution systems will consist of multiple microgrid clusters. However, interconnecting PV microgrids may lead to system interactions and instability. To date, no research work has been done to analyze the dynamic behavior and enhance the stability of microgrid clusters considering the dynamics of the PV primary sources and dc links. To fill this gap, this paper presents comprehensive modeling, analysis, and stabilization of PV-based multiple microgrid clusters. A detailed small-signal model for PV-based microgrid clusters considering local adaptive dynamic droop control mechanism of the voltage-source PV system is developed. The complete dynamic model is then used to access and compare the dynamic characteristics of the single microgrid and interconnected microgrids. In order to enhance system stability of the PV microgrid clusters, a tie-line flow and stabilization strategy is proposed to suppress the introduced interarea and local oscillations. Robustly selecting of the key control parameters is transformed to a multiobjective optimization problem which is solved by genetic algorithm. The proposed damping controller can effectively damp the power oscillations and provide robust control performance under variable operating conditions. Theoretical analysis, simulation results under various scenarios are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2752640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8595470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2752640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8595470/08049314.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Characteristics Analysis and Stabilization of PV-Based Multiple Microgrid Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Characteristics Analysis and Stabilization of PV-Based Multiple Microgrid Clusters","volume":"10","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049314/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18365256","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2015BAA06B02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201406150017"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016B020245001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005311","fundingName":"China Southern Power Grid","grantNumber":"SEPRI-K143003"},{"fundingName":"Funded Project of Guangdong Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Technology","grantNumber":"2008A060301002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Characteristics Analysis and Stabilization of PV-Based Multiple Microgrid Clusters","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhao-2752640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163039S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8049314","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049316,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0001-8468-2990","id":"37575573000"},{"name":"Rui Bo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Bo","orcid":"0000-0001-9108-1093","id":"37281891700"},{"name":"Lungsheng Chien","affiliation":["NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lungsheng","lastName":"Chien","orcid":"0000-0001-7548-6007","id":"37073251600"},{"name":"Xu Zhang","affiliation":["China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086056425"},{"name":"Shengchun Yang","affiliation":["China Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shengchun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085466515"},{"name":"Dawei Su","affiliation":["State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Su","id":"37086289305"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"8049316","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":569},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a superior GPU-accelerated algorithm for probabilistic power flow (PPF) based on Monte-Carlo simulation with simple random sampling (MCS-SRS).

crucial issue for routing algorithms in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), balancing energy consumption is a vital strategy to extend the network lifetime. Considering the node energy property or the node distance property, some conventional WSNs' routing algorithms unevenly distribute traffic over the nodes, which are not optimal to maximize the network lifetime. In this letter, a distributed joint optimization routing algorithm based on the analytic hierarchy process (DORAHP) is proposed to extend WSNs lifetime. The analytic hierarchy process is applied at the transmitter side to select the next hop node by defining three key decision criteria including the residual energy of the node, the distance from the node to the base station, and the degree of the node, which aims to extend WSNs lifetime through balancing energy consumption. At length, extensive simulation experiments for DORAHP are performed and compared with the LEACH, HEED, EERC, and GASONeC algorithms. The results indicate that DORAHP has superior performance on balancing energy consumption and on extending WSNs lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2756035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2756035","startPage":"2718","endPage":"2721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8170462/08049317.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8170462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Joint Optimization Routing Algorithm Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process for Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Joint Optimization Routing Algorithm Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process for Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"21","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17414945","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Joint Optimization Routing Algorithm Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yuan-2756035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047115S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8170462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8170462","articleId":"8049317","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049319,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["Research Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8417016/8049319/xu-2743784-small.gif","p":["Bin Xu received the B.S. degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2012.","He visited ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

In each step of the virtual control design, neural network (NN) is employed for uncertainty approximation. In previous works, most designs are directly toward system stability ignoring the fact how the NN is working as an approximator. In this paper, to enhance the learning ability, a novel prediction error signal is constructed to provide additional correction information for NN weight update using online recorded data. In this way, the neural approximation precision is highly improved, and the convergence speed can be faster. Furthermore, the sliding mode differentiator is employed to approximate the derivative of the virtual control signal, and thus, the complex analysis of the backstepping design can be avoided. The closed-loop stability is rigorously established, and the boundedness of the tracking error can be guaranteed. Through simulation of hypersonic flight dynamics, the proposed approach exhibits better tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2743784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8417016/08049319.pdf","startPage":"3839","endPage":"3849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2743784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8417016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Recorded Data-Based Composite Neural Control of Strict-Feedback Systems With Application to Hypersonic Flight Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049319/","displayDocTitle":"Online Recorded Data-Based Composite Neural Control of Strict-Feedback Systems With Application to Hypersonic Flight Dynamics","volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17936034","pubMedId":"28952951","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049319/","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622308"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Shenzhen Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160229172341417"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Recorded Data-Based Composite Neural Control of Strict-Feedback Systems With Application to Hypersonic Flight Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tnnls-xu-2743784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115071S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8417016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8417016","articleId":"8049319","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049322,"authors":[{"name":"Wayne Xiong","affiliation":["Microsoft AI and Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8114348/8049322/xiong-2756440-small.gif","p":["Wayne Xiong (M\u201907) received the Bachelor's degree in\n electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005, and the Master's degree in computer\n science and engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2007.

In this paper, we measure a human error rate on the widely used NIST 2000 test set for commercial bulk transcription. The error rate of professional transcribers is 5.9% for the Switchboard portion of the data, in which newly acquainted pairs of people discuss an assigned topic, and 11.3% for the CallHome portion, where friends and family members have open-ended conversations. In both cases, our automated system edges past the human benchmark, achieving error rates of 5.8% and 11.0%, respectively. The key to our system's performance is the use of various convolutional and long-short-term memory acoustic model architectures, combined with a novel spatial smoothing method and lattice-free discriminative acoustic training, multiple recurrent neural network language modeling approaches, and a systematic use of system combination. Comparing frequent errors in our human and machine transcripts, we find them to be remarkably similar, and highly correlated as a function of the speaker. Human subjects find it very difficult to tell which errorful transcriptions come from humans.

With the development of renewable energy, smart grid, and microgrid, more and more distributed generators will be connected to power systems. Thus the distributed control schemes become more and more important for power systems to control and manage the distributed equipment. Therefore, some consensus-based methods are published previously to solve the DED problem. But the challenge to apply the consensus-based method is to meet the power balance constraint without the centralized facility, since the value of power mismatch is hard to be obtained for a distributed control system. To solve the problem, this paper proposes the method to combine the frequency control methods with the consensus protocol from graph theory to develop the DED control method, so that the real power between the load and the generation can be balanced during the economic dispatch. With this method, a totally distributed optimal control scheme is obtained. The PI frequency controller and neural network frequency controller are employed to develop the DED control method. Then the communication failure problem is considered in this paper. The robust DED control method is proposed to improve the robustness of this distributed control method, allowing the system to stay at the optimal dispatching even if the communication is failed. In addition, the model of transmission line losses is incorporated in the DED problem to reduce the line losses. Finally, several case studies are given in this paper to verify the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","volume":"10","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18339658","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8049325/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Consensus-Based Distributed Economic Dispatch Control Method in Power Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61428301, 61433004 and 61627809"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus-Based Distributed Economic Dispatch Control Method in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-gao-2756041-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8595470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8595470","articleId":"8049325","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049326,"authors":[{"name":"Kelvin Fang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Fang","orcid":"0000-0003-2649-0653","id":"37085623136"},{"name":"James F.

It is based on the cross-polarization principle, and unlike classical approach, the introduced technique allows reading chipless tag independently of their orientation. To retrieve the tag ID, the property of short-time Fourier transform and a polarization diversity approach is exploited. The former is useful to isolate the tag mode (TM) contribution from the total backscattered signal, notably the presence of clutter form surrounding objects. The latter helps to correctly excite the tag resonant scatterers and so to maximize the receiving TM energy. The approach has been validated using a laboratory equipment test bench solution, and a cost effective solution.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2017.2750417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8105927/08049335.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2017.2750417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8105927","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Chipless RFID Reading Systems Independent of Tag Orientation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Chipless RFID Reading Systems Independent of Tag Orientation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17427679","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049335/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Chipless RFID Reading Systems Independent of Tag Orientation","sourcePdf":"lmwc-garbati-2750417-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06335S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8105927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8105927","articleId":"8049335","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049341,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhan","orcid":"0000-0002-0971-6748","id":"37085747592"},{"name":"Zhe Wen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086072973"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8049341","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":712},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Delays","Base stations","Wireless networks","Optimization","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cellular radio","convex programming","integer programming","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content cache placement","heterogeneous wireless network","mobile video traffic","cellular networks","caching ability","integer programming problem","average download time","cache size","optimal caching placement strategy","convex programming relaxation","cache allocation","conventional caching policy","small-cell base stations","SBS","NP-hard","heuristic solution","scalable video coding streaming","NP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous wireless networks","scalable video streaming","caching"]}],"abstract":"To alleviate the pressure brought by the explosion of mobile video traffic on present cellular networks, small cell base stations (SBSs) with caching ability are introduced.

We formulate an integer programming problem to minimize the average download time under the constraint of cache size at each SBS, and show that finding the optimal caching placement strategy is NP-hard. Heuristic solution was proposed based on the convex programming relaxation, which reveals the structural properties of cache allocation for each video.

In addition, split capacitor technology has also been adopted to further boost the conversion speed. With split switching method, no common mode voltage is needed in DAC reset phase and dynamic offset can be removed as well. Full adder-based encoder is employed to convert the raw 11-bit to 10-bit binary codes, showing less power penalty. The prototype ADC fabricated in 65-nm CMOS achieves 51.1 dB SNDR and 62.3 dB SFDR at 150-MS/s sampling rate.

Method for Electrical Impedance Tomography","abstract":"This paper presents an image reconstruction method based on parametric level set (PLS) method using electrical impedance tomography. The conductivity to be reconstructed was assumed to be piecewise constant and the geometry of the anomaly was represented by a shape-based PLS function, which we represent using Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF). The representation of the PLS function significantly reduces the number of unknowns, and circumvents many difficulties that are associated with traditional level set (TLS) methods, such as regularization, re-initialization and use of signed distance function. PLS reconstruction results shown in this article are some of the first ones using experimental EIT data. The performance of the PLS method was tested with water tank data for two-phase visualization and with simulations which demonstrate the most popular biomedical application of EIT: lung imaging. In addition, robustness studies of the PLS method w.r.t width of the Gaussian function and GRBF centers were performed on simulated lung imaging data. The experimental and simulation results show that PLS method has significant improvement in image quality compared with the TLS reconstruction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17574193","pubMedId":"28952939","volume":"37","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8049349/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Parametric Level Set Method for Electrical Impedance Tomography","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB921800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11227901"},{"fundingName":"CAS","grantNumber":"XDB01030400 and QYZDY-SSW-SLH004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Anhui Provincial Natural Science foundation","grantNumber":"1708085MA25"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Parametric Level Set Method for Electrical Impedance Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmi-liu-2756078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064954S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8278906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8278906","articleId":"8049349","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8049351,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyu Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/8049351/li-2752212-small.gif","p":["Xiangyu Li (M\u201912) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1977.

A hybrid application configuration, in which PAH is applied to the S-boxes while the left linear operations are protected with a general masking method, is proposed as well. This solution not only has higher energy efficiency but can also be implemented automatically in a semicustom manner. The Advanced Encryption Standard VLSI adopting this solution was implemented and manufactured in 180-nm technology as a demonstration.

Frequency diverse array (FDA)-MIMO radar can handle this problem by exploiting its range-dependent beampattern. FDA-MIMO radar was, thus, suggested for range-angle estimation of targets. Nevertheless, it is necessary to provide theoretical performance analysis for such a relatively new radar technique. Since multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is widely adopted in most of the FDA-MIMO literature, this paper derives the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound and mean square error expressions in MUSIC-based range-angle estimation algorithms for a general FDA-MIMO radar. Furthermore, the corresponding range and angle resolution thresholds in target detection and localization are also derived. Numerical results verify that the FDA-MIMO indeed outperforms conventional MIMO radar in both range-angle estimation and resolution threshold performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDA-MIMO Radar Range\u2013Angle Estimation: CRLB, MSE, and Resolution Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2017.2756498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8283929/08049352.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2756498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8283929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"FDA-MIMO Radar Range\u2013Angle Estimation: CRLB, MSE, and Resolution Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8049352/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17561799","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571081"},{"fundingName":"Young Top-Notch Talent of the National Ten Thousand Talent Program"},{"fundingName":"Open Grant of State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information Systems (CEMEE)","grantNumber":"2017K0203B"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDA-MIMO Radar Range\u2013Angle Estimation: CRLB, MSE, and Resolution Analysis","sourcePdf":"taes-wang-2756498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06806S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8283929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8283929","articleId":"8049352","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049355,"authors":[{"name":"Guosheng Hu","affiliation":["CNRS, Grenoble INP, LJK, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Inria, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"p":["Guosheng Hu, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Guosheng","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0002-9448-9892","id":"37076058400"},{"name":"Xiaojiang Peng","affiliation":["Hengyang Normal University, Hengyang, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaojiang Peng, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xiaojiang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086250628"},{"name":"Yongxin Yang","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Yongxin Yang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085614840"},{"name":"Timothy M.

In this paper, we propose a method to generate very large training data sets of synthetic images by compositing real face images in a given data set. We show that this method enables to learn models from as few as 10 000 training images, which perform on par with models trained from 500 000 images.

We describe the training process and propose an interpretation of the harmonic patterns that are learned by the hidden states of these models. We use the compound model to generate new chord sequences and estimate their probability, which we then relate to perceived harmonic complexity. In order to collect subjective ratings of complexity, we devised a listening test comprising two different experiments. In the first, subjects choose the more complex chord sequence between two. In the second, subjects rate with a continuous scale the complexity of a single chord sequence. The results of both experiments show a strong relation between negative log probability, given by our language model, and the perceived complexity ratings.

Their underlying stochastic ionic conduction behavior, intrinsic nonlinear current-voltage characteristics, and their well-known nano-fabrication process variability might normally be considered disadvantageous ReRAM features. However, using a combination of a novel architecture and special peripheral circuitry, this paper exploits these non-idealities in a physical one-way function, nonlinear resistive PUF, potentially applicable to a variety of cyber-physical security applications. We experimentally verify the performance of valency change mechanism (VCM)-based ReRAM in nano-fabricated crossbar arrays across multiple dies and runs. In addition to supporting a massive pool of challenge-response pairs (CRPs), using a combination of experiment and simulation our proposed PUF exhibits a reliability of 98.67%, a uniqueness of 49.85%, a diffuseness of 49.86%, a uniformity of 47.28%, and a bit-aliasing of 47.48%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical switches","Nonvolatile memory","Resistance","Fabrication","Electrodes","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ionic conductivity","oxidation","random-access storage","reduction (chemical)","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical unclonable function","redox","nanoionic resistive memory","resistive switching memories","promising candidates","secure physical unclonable functions","PUFs","current-voltage characteristics","nanofabrication process variability","special peripheral circuitry","nonlinear resistive PUF","cyber-physical security applications","valency change mechanism","nanofabricated crossbar arrays","nonvolatile reduction-oxidation","stochastic ionic conduction behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical unclonable function","redox-based resistive switching memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049365","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756562","startPage":"437","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8123527/08049365.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8123527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049365/","displayDocTitle":"A Physical Unclonable Function With Redox-Based Nanoionic Resistive Memory","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17394299","htmlLink":"/document/8049365/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140103448"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501332"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Physical Unclonable Function With Redox-Based Nanoionic Resistive Memory","sourcePdf":"tifs-kavehei-2756562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8123527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8123527","articleId":"8049365","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049366,"authors":[{"name":"Ishtiaq Ahmad","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8258580/8049366/ahmad-2756042-small.gif","p":["Ishtiaq Ahmad (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree (magna cum laude) in telecommunications engineering from NUCES-FAST, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2007, and the M.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical engineering from King Saud University, Riyadh, KSA, in 2012.

However, the end-to-end performance of the multi-hop relaying channel degrades compared to that observed at the first hop. This performance degradation mainly arises due to: 1) half-duplex loss and 2) hopping or relaying loss. In this paper, we analyze the degradation in outage probability and ergodic capacity due to hopping loss in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) dual-hop decode-and-forward relaying network over Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, we characterize analytically the performance degradation by deriving closed-form approximations of ergodic capacity and outage probability in the single-source single-relay single-user, single-source multiple-relay single-user, and single-source single-relay multiple-user topologies. These approximations also provide insights on how to overcome performance degradations due to hopping loss. Moreover, we show that cooperative relaying schemes can recover a significant portion of the hopping loss.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2756042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8258580/08049366.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8258580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2756042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Hopping Loss in MIMO Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Hopping Loss in MIMO Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049366/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519949","htmlLink":"/document/8049366/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Hopping Loss in MIMO Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ahmad-2756042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180294S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8258580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8258580","articleId":"8049366","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049375,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

In addition, commonly used NoCs lack low-latency multicast replication and acknowledgment aggregation mechanisms that are required to efficiently handle the collective communication requirements exhibited by many modern applications. To address these issues, the single-cycle multihop asynchronous repeated traversal (SMART) NoC architecture is proposed. By using an efficient router-bypass mechanism, the SMART NoC enables single-cycle data transfers even between physically distant on-chip routers. However, enabling single-cycle hops over long metal wires restrict the achievable clock frequency of the system. In other words, increasing the NoC clock frequency lowers the number of hops that can be bypassed in a single cycle in a fully wireline SMART NoC. In this paper, we demonstrate that by integrating on-chip wireless links, a novel look-ahead bypass-request mechanism and a congestion-free broadcast routing methodology, it is possible to enable low-latency and energy efficient data transfers in the SMART NoC even when the system is designed with high clock frequencies. For the various applications considered in this paper, the wireless-enabled SMART NoC achieves on an average 41% reduction in message latency compared to the wireline SMART NoC. This network level improvement translates into 20% savings in full system energy-delay product.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2748884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8118264/08049378.pdf","startPage":"3495","endPage":"3508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8118264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2748884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling High-Performance SMART NoC Architectures Using On-Chip Wireless Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049378","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/8118264/8049378-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Enabling High-Performance SMART NoC Architectures Using On-Chip Wireless Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049378/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17390420","htmlLink":"/document/8049378/","volume":"25","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0845504, CNS-1564014, CCF-1514269 and CCF-1162202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Enabling High-Performance SMART NoC Architectures Using On-Chip Wireless Links","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pande-2748884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10714S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8118264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8118264","articleId":"8049378","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049396,"authors":[{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Speed Circuit Design and EMC, Ministry of Education, the School of Electronic Engineering and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8248572/8049396/li-2756580-small.gif","p":["Long Li (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201911) was born in Guizhou province,\n China.

This paper presents a novel implantable magnetic coupling resonate WPT system by integrating with metasurface for biological applications. The receiver element is implanted under the skin surface 3 mm and has the dual-band property for transferring power and data telemetry simultaneously. A conformal strongly coupled magnetic resonator coil is used as the transmitting coil to construct the wireless power link. In addition, we integrate the proposed WPT system with negative permeability (MNG) metasurface over the human skin surface as a miniaturized wearable device to improve the WPT efficiency. The property of the MNG and its effect on the WPT efficiency are analyzed. Considering the special implantable environment, various misalignment tolerances between the metasurface and the receiver are discussed to evaluate the coupling response of the proposed WPT system. Finally, the efficient WPT system integrating with MNG has been verified by the experimental measurements, and the measured result shows that 15.7 dB coupling enhancement can be obtained by integrating with the MNG metasurface.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

(FD) has the potential to achieve full sum rate, but in practice, may be affected by the self interference, i.e., a loop-back interference from the transmit module to its receive module, while half duplex (HD) can avoid the self interference at the expense of lower resource efficiency. In this letter, we study a novel X-duplex scheme with two bidirectional transmission nodes. Each node is equipped with a shared antenna and two radio frequency chains used for transmission and reception. By adaptively configuring the antenna as either transmit or receive antenna, the system can operate in either FD or HD mode. The X-duplex scheme can select the optimal mode to maximize the system sum rate by dynamically configuring the antenna mode. By deriving the distributions, we investigate the system sum rate of the X-duplex scheme, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to the pure HD and FD modes. Simulation results validate our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17595968","htmlLink":"/document/8049397/","displayDocTitle":"X-Duplex Radios: Flexible Switching Between Full-Duplex and Half-Duplex","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-Duplex Radios: Flexible Switching Between Full-Duplex and Half-Duplex","sourcePdf":"lwc-song-2756052-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052251S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8293945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8293945","articleId":"8049397","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8049398,"authors":[{"name":"Ruei-Hau Hsu","affiliation":["iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8123527/8049398/hsu-2756567-small.gif","p":["Ruei-Hau Hsu (M\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Tunghai University, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2012.

During the applications of D2D communication, each device needs to identify the other devices of the same group in proximity by their group identity. This leads to the exposure of group information, by which the usage of applications can be analyzed by eavesdroppers. Hence, this paper introduces network-covered and network-absent authenticated key exchange protocols for D2D communications to guarantee accountable group anonymity, end-to-end security to network operators, as well as traceability and revocability for accounting and management requirements. We formally prove the security of those protocols, and also develop an analytic model to evaluate the quality of authentication protocols by authentication success rate in D2D communications. Besides, we implement the proposed protocols on android mobile devices to evaluate the computation costs of the protocols. We also evaluate the authentication success rate by the proposed analytic model and prove the correctness of the analytic model via simulation. Those evaluations show that the proposed protocols are feasible to the performance requirements of D2D communications.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8123527/08049398.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8123527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRAAD: Group Anonymous and Accountable D2D Communication in Mobile Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049398/","displayDocTitle":"GRAAD: Group Anonymous and Accountable D2D Communication in Mobile Networks","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394311","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049398/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2017R1C1B2009280"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion Grant, Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems Research, Korea Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2014-0-00065"},{"fundingName":"DGIST Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT","grantNumber":"17-ST-02"},{"fundingName":"Temasek Research Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRAAD: Group Anonymous and Accountable D2D Communication in Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-lee-2756567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121588S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8123527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8123527","articleId":"8049398","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049399,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Lashgari","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8123527/8049399/lashg-2756602-small.gif","p":["Sina Lashgari received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology in 2010, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

Each node in the network is equipped with an arbitrary number of antennas. Furthermore, channels are time varying, and there is no channel state information available at the transmitter (CSIT) with respect to eavesdroppers' channels; and transmitter only has access to delayed CSIT of the channel to the legitimate receiver. The secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) for such a network has only been characterized for special cases, and is unknown in general. We completely characterize the SDoF of this network for all antenna configurations. In particular, we strictly improve the state-of-the-art achievable scheme for this network by proposing more efficient artificial noise alignment at the receivers. Furthermore, we develop a tight upper bound by utilizing three important inequalities that provide lower bounds on the received signal dimensions at receivers which supply delayed CSIT or no CSIT. These inequalities together allow for analysis of signal dimensions in networks with heterogeneous CSIT; and as a result, we present a converse proof that leads to characterization of SDoF for all possible antenna configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy DoF of Blind MIMOME Wiretap Channel With Delayed CSIT","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756602","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8123527/08049399.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8123527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049399","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10206/8123527/8049399-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy DoF of Blind MIMOME Wiretap Channel With Delayed CSIT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8049399/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394305","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CAREER 0953117, CCF-1161720 and NETS-1161904"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N000141310094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secrecy DoF of Blind MIMOME Wiretap Channel With Delayed CSIT","sourcePdf":"tifs-lashgari-2756602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122524S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8123527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8123527","articleId":"8049399","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049411,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxiang Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8123527/8049411/li-2756350-small.gif","p":["Lingxiang Li received the B.S. degree all in electrical engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2013.

We consider a linear precoder design for a multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian wiretap channel, which comprises two legitimate nodes, i.e., Alice and Bob, operating in FD mode and exchanging confidential messages in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Using the sum secrecy degrees of freedoms (sum SDoFs) as metric, we formulate an optimization problem with respect to Alice's and Bob's precoding matrices. In order to solve this problem, we first propose a cooperative secrecy transmission scheme, whose feasible set is sufficient to achieve the maximum sum SDoF. Based on that feasible set, we then determine in closed form the maximum achievable sum SDoF and also provide a method for constructing the precoding matrix pair, which achieves the maximum sum SDoF. The latter pair would be near-optimal in terms of the achievable secrecy sum rate in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. By providing the maximum achievable sum SDoF as a function of the number of antennas, one could select the optimal system parameters to further maximize the achievable sum SDoF. We use simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed precoding matrices in realistic channel scenarios and at various levels of the SNR.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8123527/08049411.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2756350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8123527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for an MIMO Gaussian Wiretap Channel With Full-Duplex Source and Destination Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049411/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoder Design for an MIMO Gaussian Wiretap Channel With Full-Duplex Source and Destination Nodes","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17394298","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049411/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631004 and 61571089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoder Design for an MIMO Gaussian Wiretap Channel With Full-Duplex Source and Destination Nodes","sourcePdf":"tifs-chen-2756350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200458S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8123527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8123527","articleId":"8049411","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049412,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Sapountzis","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom, Biot, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/8214923/8049412/sapou-2746011-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Sapountzis received the Diploma degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Greece, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Eurecom/Telecom ParisTech, France.

Denser deployments make the problem of user association challenging, and much work has been devoted to finding algorithms that strike a tradeoff between user quality of service, and network-wide performance (load-balancing). Nevertheless, the majority of these algorithms typically consider simple setups with a single type of traffic, usually elastic non-guaranteed bit rate (GBR). They also focus on the radio access part, ignoring the backhaul topology and potential capacity limitations. Backhaul constraints are emerging as a key performance bottleneck in future networks, partly due to the continuous improvement of the radio interface, and partly due to the need for inexpensive backhaul links to reduce capital and operational expenditures. To this end, we propose an analytical framework for user association that jointly considers radio access and backhaul network performance. Specifically, we derive an algorithm that takes into account spectral efficiency, base station load, backhaul link capacities and topology, and two traffic classes (GBR and non-GBR) in both the uplink and downlink directions. We prove analytically an optimal user association rule that ends up maximizing either an arithmetic or a weighted harmonic mean of the achieved performance along different dimensions (e.g., uplink and downlink performances or GBR and non-GBR performances). We then use extensive simulations to study the impact of: 1) traffic differentiation; and 2) backhaul capacity limitations and topology on key performance metrics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2017.2746011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8214923","startPage":"3396","endPage":"3410","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/8214923/08049412.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Association in HetNets: Impact of Traffic Differentiation and Backhaul Limitations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049412/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"User Association in HetNets: Impact of Traffic Differentiation and Backhaul Limitations","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17447705","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council under the European Community Seventh Framework Programme through the ICT theme of DG-CONNECT n\u00b0 317941 (iJOIN)","grantNumber":"FP7/2012-2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Association in HetNets: Impact of Traffic Differentiation and Backhaul Limitations","sourcePdf":"tnet-sapountzis-2746011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107342S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"8214923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8214923","articleId":"8049412","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8049414,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Lin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8119588/8049414/lin-2750742-small.gif","p":["Kun-Lin Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering.

Based on the three degrees-of-freedom model of the surface vessel, the designed backstepping control scheme features three functional parts, namely, guidance, attitude control, and velocity control. To guarantee that the position errors are confined within the prescribed convergence rates and maximum overshoot, a performance constrained guidance law is formulated with an error transformed function. Command filters are incorporated in the control subsections to limit the magnitude of the virtual controls and simultaneously avoid arduous computations involving their time derivatives. Subsequently, auxiliary systems that are governed by smooth switching functions are developed in an unprecedented manner to compensate for the saturation constraints on actuators. Nonlinear disturbance observers are concurrently introduced to estimate the unknown external disturbances for increasing system's robustness. It is demonstrated that under the proposed control, the prescribed transient and steady tracking performance bounds are never violated, and all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, despite the presence of input saturation and disturbances. Results from a comparative simulation study illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2017.2756110","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/8196978/08049416.pdf","startPage":"2564","endPage":"2575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2017.2756110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8196978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path Following of a Surface Vessel With Prescribed Performance in the Presence of Input Saturation and External Disturbances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049416/","displayDocTitle":"Path Following of a Surface Vessel With Prescribed Performance in the Presence of Input Saturation and External Disturbances","volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17446991","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049416/","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503010 and 61673034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2016ZA51001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Following of a Surface Vessel With Prescribed Performance in the Presence of Input Saturation and External Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tmech-zheng-2756110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103753S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8196978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8196978","articleId":"8049416","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049439,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Nantong University, Nantong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049439/tang-2756638-small.gif","p":["Hui Tang was born in Nantong, China.

The reconfiguration performance is realized to be frequency-hopping by inserting polypropylene tubes, which act as microfluidic controllers selectively filled with deionized (DI) water between the patch and ground plane. It is a low-cost and environment-friendly choice for frequency-reconfigurable microwave devices and low profile patch antennas. Remarkably, controllability of the frequency-hopping range, number of hopping frequencies and hopping states in the proposed design can be obtained by adjusting the locations and numbers of the tube. With this feature, the hopping range of the operating frequency can be effectively enlarged using as few tubes as possible through choosing appropriate positions for adding the tubes. To verify the proposed concepts, the experimental prototypes of a patch antenna and an array are designed, fabricated and measured, and the simulated and measured results are presented, showcasing good agreement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049439.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756638","startPage":"20470","endPage":"20476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microfluidically Frequency-Reconfigurable Microstrip Patch Antenna and Array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049439/","displayDocTitle":"Microfluidically Frequency-Reconfigurable Microstrip Patch Antenna and Array","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049439/","volume":"5","accessionNumber":"17515817","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","publicationDate":"2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501265"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20161281"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Microfluidically Frequency-Reconfigurable Microstrip Patch Antenna and Array","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2756638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076856S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049439","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049440,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049440/li-2756826-small.gif","p":["Ting Li is currently pursuing the degree with the School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, China.

FC can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that services the edges of networks. A cooperative relationship among applications to collect data in a city is a fundamental research topic in FC. When considering the green cloud, people or vehicles with smart-sensor devices can be viewed as users in FC and can forward sensing data to the data center. In a traditional sensing process, rewards are paid according to the distances between the users and the platform, which can be seen as the existing solution. Because users with smart-sensing devices tend to participate in tasks with high rewards, the number of users in suburban regions is smaller, and data collection is sparse and cannot satisfy the demands of the tasks. However, there are many users in urban regions, which makes data collection costly and of low quality. In this paper, a cooperative-based model for smartphone tasks, named a cooperative-based model for smart-sensing tasks (CMST), is proposed to promote the quality of data collection in FC networks. In the CMST scheme, we develop an allocation method focused on improving the rewards in suburban regions. The rewards to each user with a smart sensor are distributed according to the region density. Moreover, for each task there is a cooperative relationship among the users; they cooperate with one another to reach the volume of data that the platform requires. Extensive experiments show that our scheme improves the overall data-coverage factor by 14.997% to 31.46%, and the platform cost can be reduced by 35.882%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049440.pdf","startPage":"21296","endPage":"21311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperative-Based Model for Smart-Sensing Tasks in Fog Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data collection","Cloud computing","Edge computing","Computational modeling","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data acquisition","groupware","intelligent sensors","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative-based model","smart-sensing tasks","fog computing","smart-sensor devices","data center","smart-sensing devices","smartphone tasks","data-coverage factor","sensing process","data collection","cloud computing","green cloud"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fog computing","cloud computing","smart-sensing tasks","costs","coverage"]}],"topic":"Green Cloud and Fog Computing: Energy Efficient and Sustainable Infrastructures, Protocols and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative-Based Model for Smart-Sensing Tasks in Fog Computing","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8049440/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17515818","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772554, 61379110, 61572526 and 61572528"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China, 973 Program","grantNumber":"2014CB046305"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Cooperative-Based Model for Smart-Sensing Tasks in Fog Computing","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2756826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121467S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Green Cloud and Fog Computing: Energy Efficient and Sustainable Infrastructures, Protocols and Applications"],"articleId":"8049440","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049444,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049444/li-2756670-small.gif","p":["Hui Li (S\u201908\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in optical engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2007, and the Ph.

This paper describes the design and optimization procedure of a single-layer tag antenna, which covers relatively long reading range when mounted on both metallic surface and various dielectrics. The antenna is based on the loop structure, with a small ka of 0.66. Characteristic mode analysis is first performed to inspect how a typical loop structure radiates in free space and on PEC. Antenna structure is then designed based on the characteristics of the loop. Afterward, equivalent circuits of the tag antenna on dielectrics and on metal are extracted, in order to provide guidance for antenna optimization. The proposed tag antenna achieves the maximum reading distance of 6.1 m and 14.1 m, respectively, when mounted on metal and dielectrics with low permittivity. Measurements of the tag antenna were carried out in different environments, including outdoor scenario, indoor scenarios with low and high reflections. The measured results agree reasonably well with the predicted ones. The tag antenna is proved to be competitive in perspective of simple structure, low cost, long reading distance, and tolerance on various background materials.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","accessionNumber":"17515819","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049444/","displayDocTitle":"Compact Single-Layer RFID Tag Antenna Tolerant to Background Materials","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601079 and 61571087"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning","grantNumber":"20170540169"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Compact Single-Layer RFID Tag Antenna Tolerant to Background Materials","sourcePdf":"access-li-2756670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109203S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049444","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8049445,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Irfan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, CECOS University of IT and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049445/irfan-2756702-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Irfan received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2016, respectively.

The proposed architecture is a matrix of G-AETCAM cells arranged in the form of rows and columns using flip-flop as a memory element and a control logic circuitry consisting of logic gates. One G-AETCAM cell encodes the input and stored bit into one encoded bit which results in a match-line after passing from the AND-gate-array. Many architectures configure random-access memory (RAM) available on FPGAs as content-addressable storage architecture but are efficient for specific size and deal with data only in ascending or descending order while the proposed architecture provides freedom in size with no chance of making a single memory cell as useless and can store ternary data in any order. RAM-based TCAMs require pre-processing for the storage of TCAM words while the proposed design does not involve any pre-processing. The proposed architecture reduces the transistor count by a factor of 25.55, as compared with the RAM-based TCAM, which ultimately reduces area and increases the speed of operations.

However, to meet the requirements of deploying the future grid at a large scale, the state estimation algorithm must be able to accomplish two major tasks: 1) combining measurement data with different qualities to attain an optimal state estimate and 2) dealing with the large number of measurement data rendered by meter devices. To address these two tasks, we first propose a practical solution using a very short word length to represent a partial measurement of the system state in the meter device to reduce the amount of data. We then develop a unified probabilistic framework based on a Bayesian belief inference to incorporate measurements of different qualities to obtain an optimal state estimate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms other linear estimators in different test scenarios. These findings indicate that the proposed scheme not only has the ability to integrate data with different qualities but can also decrease the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and processed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049448/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17363297","volume":"5","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"State Estimation in Smart Distribution System With Low-Precision Measurements","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E-017-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"State Estimation in Smart Distribution System With Low-Precision Measurements","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2756844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115208S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049448","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049449,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Yi Tsai","affiliation":["Providence University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049449/tsai-2756624-small.gif","p":["Hsin-Yi Tsai is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the Department of Computer Science, Providence University, Taichung, Taiwan.

In this paper, zero-padded tri-mode OFDM with index modulation (ZTM-OFDM-IM) is proposed, which is capable of achieving high spectral and energy efficiency. In ZTM-OFDM-IM, subcarriers are partitioned into subblocks. In each OFDM subblock, only a fraction of subcarriers are modulated by two distinguishable constellation alphabets, while the others remain empty, which reduces the energy consumption. With such an arrangement, extra information bits can be carried by the subcarrier activation pattern. At the receiver, a maximum-likelihood (ML) detector as well as a reduced-complexity two-stage log-likelihood ratio (LLR) detector are developed for signal demodulation. Theoretical performance analysis based on Euclidean distance metric and pairwise error probability are conducted. Besides, in order to attain better BER performance, the design strategies for the two distinguishable constellation alphabets are investigated, which is followed by brief discussions on generalization methods for the proposed ZTM-OFDM-IM. It is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations that ZTM-OFDM-IM is capable of enhancing the BER performance compared with the conventional OFDM and other conventional index-modulated OFDM benchmarks, which provides high-rate data transmission with low energy consumption. Moreover, the LLR detection of ZTM-OFDM-IM only suffers from slight performance loss in comparison with the ML detection and achieves significant complexity reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049450.pdf","startPage":"21168","endPage":"21178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Padded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation Using Multiple Constellation Alphabets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","Modulation","Energy consumption","Detectors","Performance gain","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","demodulation","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-padded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple constellation alphabets","ZTM-OFDM-IM","high spectral energy efficiency","distinguishable constellation alphabets","subcarrier activation pattern","energy consumption","next-generation networks","zero-padded trimode OFDM subcarriers","index-modulated OFDM benchmarks","maximum-likelihood detector","ML detector","reduced-complexity two-stage log-likelihood ratio detector","LLR detector","signal demodulation","Euclidean distance metric","pairwise error probability","BER performance","Monte Carlo simulations","high-rate data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Index modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","energy efficiency","spectral efficiency","maximum-likelihood detection","log-likelihood ratio detection"]}],"topic":"Index Modulation Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Padded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation Using Multiple Constellation Alphabets","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8049450/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"17515821","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571267"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Peacock Plan","grantNumber":"1108170036003286"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Visible Light Communication System Key Laboratory","grantNumber":"ZDSYS20140512114229398"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Zero-Padded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation Using Multiple Constellation Alphabets","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2756659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.285416S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Index Modulation Techniques for Next-Generation Wireless Networks"],"articleId":"8049450","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049455,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Hsin Chou","affiliation":["National Chi Nan University, Puli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049455/chou-2756842-small.gif","p":["Yao-Hsin Chou received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009.

Selecting the stocks that simultaneously offer high return and low risk is a difficult problem that is worth investigating. However, the traditional risk calculation based on the modern portfolio theory (MPT) of portfolios has some defects. The MPT method requires the calculations of every relationship between each pair of stocks in the portfolio, entailing high computation complexity, which grows exponentially with the increased number of stocks. Besides, the traditional calculation is unable to calculate the coefficient of variation, and merely considers the relationship between each pair of stocks, so it cannot accurately assess portfolio risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, funds standardization, and utilizes it to represent the portfolio return and calculate portfolio risk. The fluctuation of portfolio funds standardization shows not only the relationships between each pair of stocks, but also the interactions among all stocks. Hence, utilizing funds standardization can accurately assess portfolio risk and completely represent the mood swings of investors. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method significantly reduces the computation complexity because the complexity does not increase when the portfolios stock number increases. We combine the genetic algorithm, Sharpe ratio and funds standardization to find the optimal portfolio. In addition, we utilize the sliding window to avoid the over-fitting problem, which is common in this field, and test the effect of all kinds of training and testing periods. The experimental results show that the portfolio can spread the risk effectively, and that the portfolio risk can be assessed accurately by utilizing the funds standardization. Comparing with the traditional method, our method can identify the optimal portfolio efficiently and establish a portfolio that has lower risk and stable return.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756842","startPage":"21885","endPage":"21900","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049455.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portfolio Optimization Based on Funds Standardization and Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Portfolios","Standardization","Genetic algorithms","Stock markets","Investment","Neural networks","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","investment","risk management","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portfolio risk","portfolio return","genetic algorithm","portfolio optimization","stock market","traditional risk calculation","stock selection","funds standardization","modern portfolio theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Portfolio","Sharpe ratio","stock selection","funds standardization","low volatility","Genetic algorithm (GA)","modern portfolio theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Portfolio Optimization Based on Funds Standardization and Genetic Algorithm","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8049455/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17341414","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Portfolio Optimization Based on Funds Standardization and Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"access-chou-2756842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095933S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"8049455","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8049460,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengchun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhengchun Zhou received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in information security from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2001, 2004, and 2010, respectively.

This problem is known to be NP-hard in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations is on the order of the number of unknowns, TAF recovers the solution exactly (up to a global unimodular constant) with high probability and complexity growing linearly with both the number of unknowns and the number of equations. Our TAF approach adapts the amplitude based empirical loss function and proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we introduce an orthogonality-promoting initialization that can be obtained with a few power iterations. Stage two refines the initial estimate by successive updates of scalable truncated generalized gradient iterations, which are able to handle the rather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth amplitude based objective function. In particular, when vectors x and a\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n's are real valued, our gradient truncation rule provably eliminates erroneously estimated signs with high probability to markedly improve upon its untruncated version. Numerical tests using synthetic data and real images demonstrate that our initialization returns more accurate and robust estimates relative to spectral initializations. Furthermore, even under the same initialization, the proposed amplitude-based refinement outperforms existing Wirtinger flow variants, corroborating the superior performance of TAF over state-of-the-art algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8263292/08049465.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2756858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2756858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8263292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Systems of Random Quadratic Equations via Truncated Amplitude Flow","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Noise measurement","Mathematical model","Complexity theory","Linear programming","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","estimation theory","gradient methods","iterative methods","matrix algebra","probability","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random quadratic equations","random measurement vectors","TAF approach","orthogonality-promoting initialization","power iterations","scalable truncated generalized gradient iterations","gradient truncation rule","spectral initializations","Wirtinger flow variants","truncated amplitude flow","unknown vector recovery","NP-hard problem","amplitude based empirical loss function","nonconvex amplitude","nonsmooth amplitude based objective function","amplitude-based refinement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonconvex optimization","phase retrieval","amplitude-based cost function","orthogonality-promoting initialization","truncated gradient","linear convergence to global minimum"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8263292/8049465-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Solving Systems of Random Quadratic Equations via Truncated Amplitude Flow","volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8049465/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519219","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1500713 and 1514056"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Solving Systems of Random Quadratic Equations via Truncated Amplitude Flow","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2756858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140301S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8263292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"8263292","articleId":"8049465","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":8049470,"authors":[{"name":"Mladen Kova\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Mladen Kova\u010devi\u0107 received his Dipl.-Ing.

Two channel models are introduced and their zeroerror capacities and zero-error-detection capacities determined by explicit constructions of optimal codes. Model A can be informally described as follows: 1) The information is stored in an n-cell register, where each cell is either empty or contains a particle of one of P possible types and 2) due to the imperfections of the device each of the particles may be shifted several cells away from its original position over time. Model B is an abstraction of a single-server queue: 1) The transmitter sends packets from a P-ary alphabet through a queuing system with an infinite buffer and a first-in-first-out service procedure and 2) each packet is being processed by the server for a random number of time slots. More general models including additional types of noise that the particles/packets can experience are also studied, as are the continuous-time versions of these problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Channel capacity","Registers","Servers","Electronic mail","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","error correction codes","queueing theory","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-shift channels","zeroerror capacities","communication channels","FIFO queues","zero-error capacity","P-ary alphabet","n-cell register","zero-error-detection capacities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero-error code","zero-error detection","bit-shift channel","peak-shift","timing channel","queue","delay"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2756667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8114709/08049470.pdf","startPage":"7698","endPage":"7707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2756667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Error Capacity of $ P $ -ary Shift Channels and FIFO Queues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Error Capacity of $ P $ -ary Shift Channels and FIFO Queues","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049470/","volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049470/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17364031","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Ministry of Education - Singapore","grantNumber":"R-263-000-B61-112"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia"},{"fundingName":"Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, province of Vojvodina"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Error Capacity of $ P $ -ary Shift Channels and FIFO Queues","sourcePdf":"tit-kovacevic-2756667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102272S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8114709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8114709","articleId":"8049470","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049473,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed-Mojtaba Sadrpour","affiliation":["Antenna and Microwave Research Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed-Mojtaba","lastName":"Sadrpour","id":"37085882025"},{"name":"Vahid Nayyeri","affiliation":["Antenna and Microwave Research Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Nayyeri","orcid":"0000-0002-0328-4737","id":"37860173500"},{"name":"Mohammad Soleimani","affiliation":["Antenna and Microwave Research Laboratory, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Soleimani","id":"37312391400"},{"name":"Omar M.

This paper addresses system performance boundaries and the analysis method toward multibeam communications at millimeter wave. We combine analysis from antennas and propagation to the radio frequency (RF) transceiver specifications and beamforming requirements. Realistic propagation model and antenna implementation are used to generate beam-specific path gains and provide a wide variety of user scenarios. Using this approach, system level interdependencies and RF performance boundaries can be verified with different antenna configurations in various propagation environments.

mobility transistors were integrated into monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) by molding hetero-substrates and using a redistribution layer (RDL). Driver amplifiers (DAs) and high-power amplifiers (HPAs) on SiC substrates were molded with matching circuits on Si substrates including Cu-filled through-substrate vias (TSVs), and their circuits on hetero-substrates were connected using a Cu RDL. This was the first attempt to fabricate hetero-substrate MMICs with five chips for two-stage power amplifiers. This method will be very useful to increase the achievable quantity of small DAs and HPAs-as opposed to using large MMICs with matching circuits on a SiC substrate-and to reduce production costs. Furthermore, various frequency bands, such as the millimeter-wave band, can be accommodated by changing the Si chips of the matching circuits.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8066394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2017.2756823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel7/66/8066394/08049475.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"455","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2017.2756823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Integration of Microwave GaN Power Amplifiers With Si Matching Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Integration of Microwave GaN Power Amplifiers With Si Matching Circuits","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8049475/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17303208","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Integration of Microwave GaN Power Amplifiers With Si Matching Circuits","sourcePdf":"tsm-sato-2756823-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07157S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"8066394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8066394","articleId":"8049475","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049477,"authors":[{"name":"Heng Qin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Heng","lastName":"Qin","orcid":"0000-0002-7537-8716","id":"37086051598"},{"name":"Yong Zuo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37309326400"},{"name":"Feiyu Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feiyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086051031"},{"name":"Risheng Cong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Risheng","lastName":"Cong","id":"37086057355"},{"name":"Lingchao Meng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lingchao","lastName":"Meng","id":"37086052927"},{"name":"Jian Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085355447"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"8049477","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Channel models","Photonics","Optical transmitters","Multiplexing","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","optical communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric channel structure","rank attribute","realistic MIMO UV system design","propagation MIMO channel model","nonline-of-sight ultraviolet optical transmission","inclusive scattered propagation multiple input multiple output channel model prototype","MIMO UV channel model","3-D narrow-band channel response","transmitter elevation angle","receiver spacing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-line-of-sight optical transmission","MIMO systems","spatial correlation","channel capacity"]}],"abstract":"An inclusive scattered propagation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel model prototype is proposed for multiplexed non-line-of-sight ultraviolet (UV) optical transmission to fill up this theory blank.

The proposed framework is aiming to address two limits of the existing CNN based methods. First, region-based CNN methods lack sufficient context to accurately locate salient object since they deal with each region independently. Second, pixel-based CNN methods suffer from blurry boundaries due to the presence of convolutional and pooling layers. Motivated by these, we first propose an end-to-end edge-preserved neural network based on Fast R-CNN framework (named RegionNet) to efficiently generate saliency map with sharp object boundaries. Later, to further improve it, multi-scale spatial context is attached to RegionNet to consider the relationship between regions and the global scenes. Furthermore, our method can be generally applied to RGB-D saliency detection by depth refinement. The proposed framework achieves both clear detection boundary and multi-scale contextual robustness simultaneously for the first time, and thus achieves an optimized performance. Experiments on six RGB and two RGB-D benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Preserving and Multi-Scale Contextual Neural Network for Salient Object Detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2756825","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8071125/08049485.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2756825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8071125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049485/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Edge Preserving and Multi-Scale Contextual Neural Network for Salient Object Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8049485/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17260118","pubMedId":"28952942","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171113"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0100900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Preserving and Multi-Scale Contextual Neural Network for Salient Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tip-ma-2756825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097962S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8071125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8071125","articleId":"8049485","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049489,"authors":[{"name":"Seshadri Sivakumar","affiliation":["Pasumai EnergyTech LLC, Richmond, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8466053/8049489/sivak-2751005-small.gif","p":["Seshadri Sivakumar (S\u201981\u2013M\u201986\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.E. degree in electrical technology and electronics from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India, in 1977, and the M.Sc.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, in 1983 and 1987.","He is currently the Chief Consultant with Pasumai Energytech LLC, Richmond, CA, USA, and is on assignment with Healy Wave Energy LLC, Hollis, NH, USA, developing smart control and power electronic systems for a wave energy converter.

The triangular structure of the weight matrices is exploited to readily ensure that the eigenvalues of the feedback weight matrix represented by the block diagonal elements lie on the unit circle in the complex z-plane by updating these weights based on the differential of the angular error variable. Such placement of the eigenvalues together with the extended close interaction between state variables facilitated by the nondiagonal triangular elements, enhances the learning ability of the proposed architecture. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture is highly effective in time-series prediction tasks associated with nonlinear and chaotic dynamic systems with underlying oscillatory modes. This modular architecture with dual upper and lower triangular feedback weight matrices mimics fully recurrent network architectures, while maintaining learning stability with a simplified training process. While training, the block-diagonal weights (hence the eigenvalues) of the dual triangular matrices are constrained to the same values during weight updates aimed at minimizing the possibility of overfitting. The dual triangular architecture also exploits the benefit of parsing the input and selectively applying the parsed inputs to the two subnetworks to facilitate enhanced learning performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2751005","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8466053/08049489.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2850","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2751005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Marginally Stable Triangular Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for Time Series Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Marginally Stable Triangular Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for Time Series Prediction","volume":"48","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18094867","pubMedId":"28952955","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8049489/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Marginally Stable Triangular Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for Time Series Prediction","sourcePdf":"tcyb-sivakumar-2751005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133157S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8466053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8466053","articleId":"8049489","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8049492,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Huang","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/8283929/8049492/huang-2756763-small.gif","p":["Yulong Huang received the B.S. degree in automation from the\n Department of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2012, and is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering.","Since November 2016, he has been a Visiting Graduate Researcher at the Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia\n University, New York, NY, USA.

Instead of applying a full modular reduction to a 2k-bit product, the proposed partial modular reduction method iteratively performs reductions on partial products whose bit length is slightly greater than k, where k is the bit length of field elements. As a result, the computational complexity of modular multiplication (MM) was significantly reduced. Moreover, the amount of computation is configurable by parameterizing the size of the partial products. This is a very desirable characteristic of the proposed ECC processor, because the hardware complexity and processing time of the entire ECC processor can be adjusted according to the requirements of various Internet of Things environments. Including the proposed MM module, finite field operation modules are integrated into a single module to further reduce the required resources. The proposed ECC processor synthesized using 180-nm CMOS process technology can perform a 256-bit elliptic curve point multiplication in 0.20-0.74 ms with 144.8k- 65.4k gate counts. These results and the experimental results in various FPGA devices show that the proposed ECC processor has significantly better throughput per area than the previously reported ones.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2756680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2756680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08049496.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Elliptic Curve Cryptography Processor Based on Configurable Partial Modular Reduction Over NIST Prime Fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Elliptic Curve Cryptography Processor Based on Configurable Partial Modular Reduction Over NIST Prime Fields","volume":"65","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049496/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18194601","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049496/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KETEP and MOTIE, South Korea","grantNumber":"20161210200610"},{"fundingName":"MSIT, under the ITRC Support Program supervised by the IITP, South Korea","grantNumber":"IITP-2017-2012-0-00646"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Elliptic Curve Cryptography Processor Based on Configurable Partial Modular Reduction Over NIST Prime Fields","sourcePdf":"tcsii-kim-2756680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086541S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8513902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8513902","articleId":"8049496","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049497,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xiao","affiliation":["School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0002-8890-4383","id":"37086131338"},{"name":"Yang Shi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0003-1337-5322","id":"37420083500"},{"name":"Wei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ren","orcid":"0000-0002-2818-9752","id":"37271980400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8049497","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1820},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Multi-agent systems","Delays","Measurement errors","Sensors","Delay effects","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","control system synthesis","delays","linear systems","Lyapunov methods","sampled data systems","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness analysis","sampled-data multiagent networks","time-varying delays","simultaneous stability problem","finite number","locally interconnected linear subsystems","aperiodic sampling","measurement errors","decentralized system","consensus analysis","multiagent systems","quantizing devices","data sampling","state measurement","event-based control","maximum allowable intersampling periods","coupling structures","asynchronous sampling","asynchronous broadcasting","self-sampled states","logarithmic quantizers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperiodic sampling","asynchronous multiagent systems","consensus","event-triggered control","simultaneous stability","time-varying delays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049497","abstract":"In this paper, we study the simultaneous stability problem of a finite number of locally interconnected linear subsystems under practical constraints, including asynchronous and aperiodic sampling, time-varying delays, and measurement errors.

This system has a particular simple structure of interconnections, but it captures some key characteristics of a large class of intermediate models derived from the consensus analysis of multiagent systems. The asynchrony of aperiodic sampling and the existence of measurement errors allow the utilization of some kinds of quantizing devices, such as Logarithmic quantizers, in the process of data sampling, and allow the introduction of a period of dwell time after each update of state measurement to eliminate the Zeno behavior of events in event-based control. The stability result is applicable to the estimation of the maximum allowable intersampling periods and time delays based on individual dynamics and coupling structures in the scenarios of consensus control via asynchronous sampling of relative states and asynchronous broadcasting of self-sampled states, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2017.2756860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2017.2756860","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/8395242/08049497.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8395242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Asynchronous Sampled-Data Multiagent Networks With Time-Varying Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Asynchronous Sampled-Data Multiagent Networks With Time-Varying Delays","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2018","volume":"63","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049497/","accessionNumber":"17874719","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049497/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0178"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"B17048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Analysis of Asynchronous Sampled-Data Multiagent Networks With Time-Varying Delays","sourcePdf":"tac-xiao-2756860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111374S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8395242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8395242","articleId":"8049497","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049503,"authors":[{"name":"Can Cui","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8081774/8049503/cui-2756861-small.gif","p":["Can Cui was born in Bengbu, China, in 1987.

In this paper, a new sub-Nyquist sampling array architecture for the multi-band signal carrier frequency and DOA estimation based on a uniform linear array is proposed, which consists of a two-stage estimate algorithm and the corresponding parameter pairing approach. We first adopt a sub-Nyquist sampling structure, namely, a modulated wideband converter (MWC), to sample the received signal at the reference sensor, and then the signal is reconstructed and the carrier frequencies are estimated accordingly. Second, the sub-Nyquist sampling data of other sensors are similarly obtained by using one channel of the MWC, respectively. In doing so, conventional DOA estimation algorithms can be adopted for the multi-band signals and a linearly correlated steering vector can be easily resolved. Furthermore, an effective pairing approach is also developed to match the multi-band signals in the estimated DOAs. The effectiveness of all the proposed methods is verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2756861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2756861","startPage":"7470","endPage":"7478","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8081774/08049503.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8081774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Frequency and DOA Estimation of Sub-Nyquist Sampling Multi-Band Sensor Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2017","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Frequency and DOA Estimation of Sub-Nyquist Sampling Multi-Band Sensor Signals","publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2017","volume":"17","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049503/","accessionNumber":"17284750","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049503/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401208"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Frequency and DOA Estimation of Sub-Nyquist Sampling Multi-Band Sensor Signals","sourcePdf":"jsen-cui-2756861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072738S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8081774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8081774","articleId":"8049503","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8049504,"authors":[{"name":"Keshab K.

Methods: The proposed method consists of two CNNs (Segment CNN and Epi-Endo CNN) to classify among ventricular sources from 25 segments and from epicardium (Epi) or endocardium (Endo). The inputs are the full time courses and the first half of QRS complexes of 12-lead ECG, respectively. After registering the ventricle computer model with an individual patient's heart, the training datasets were generated by multiplying ventricular current dipoles derived from single pacing at various locations with patient-specific lead field. The origins of PVC are localized by calculating the weighted center of gravity of classification returned by the CNNs. A number of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed method under a variety of noise levels and heart registration errors. Furthermore, the proposed method was evaluated on 90 PVC beats from nine human patients with PVCs and compared against ablation outcome in the same patients. Results: The computer simulation evaluation returned relatively high accuracies for Segment CNN (~78%) and Epi-Endo CNN (~90%). Clinical testing in nine PVC patients resulted an averaged localization error of 11 mm. Conclusion: Our simulation and clinical evaluation results demonstrate the capability and merits of the proposed CNN-based method for localization of PVC. Significance: This paper suggests a new approach for cardiac source localization of origin of arrhythmias using only the 12-lead ECG by means of CNN, and may have important applications for future real-time monitoring and localizing origins of cardiac arrhythmias guiding ablation treatment.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2756869","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8387528/08049505.pdf","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2756869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of Origins of Premature Ventricular Contraction by Means of Convolutional Neural Network From 12-Lead ECG","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8387528/8049505-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Localization of Origins of Premature Ventricular Contraction by Means of Convolutional Neural Network From 12-Lead ECG","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839778","pubMedId":"28952932","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8049505/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"HL080093"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CBET-0756331"},{"fundingName":"Chinese \u201c111 Project\u201d","grantNumber":"B08020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Localization of Origins of Premature Ventricular Contraction by Means of Convolutional Neural Network From 12-Lead ECG","sourcePdf":"tbme-he-2756869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133109S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8387528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8387528","articleId":"8049505","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8049509,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Liu","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-6226-2880","id":"37085444285"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Aerospace Research and Innovation in Electronic Systems Center, Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","orcid":"0000-0003-2540-5234","id":"37393409900"},{"name":"Liyi Xiao","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Liyi","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37539977500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-4388"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2574"}],"articleNumber":"8049509","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Delays","Error correction codes","Materials reliability","Object recognition","Error correction","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","error correction codes","error detection codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct compare","double error-correction codes","soft errors","single error correction-double error detection codes","multiple bit errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data comparison","soft errors","error correction codes (ECCs)","double error correction","cache tag"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2017.2756853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/8169690/08049509.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8169690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2017.2756853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating Direct Compare for Double Error-Correction Codes","abstract":"Direct compare of information coded with error-correction codes has been proposed to efficiently protect data comparisons against soft errors.

The underlying idea of the construction exploits certain common characteristics of polar codes that are optimized for a sequence of successively degraded channels. The proposed code consists of parallel concatenation of multiple polar codes with information-bit divider at the input of each polar encoder. Thus, it is referred to as parallel concatenated polar (PCP) codes. A lower-rate PCP code is simply constructed by adding more constituent polar codes, which enables incremental retransmissions at different rates in order to adapt to channel conditions. Due to the length limitation of polar codes, the PCP code can only support a restricted set of rates that is characterized by the size of the kernel when conventional polar codes are used. To overcome this limitation, punctured polar codes, which provide more flexibility on blocklength by controlling a puncturing fraction, are considered as constituent codes. The existence of capacity-achieving punctured polar codes for any given puncturing fraction is proven. Using such punctured polar codes as constituent codes, it is shown that the proposed PCP code is capacity achieving for an arbitrary sequence of rates and for any class of degraded channels.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2756668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8114709/08049513.pdf","startPage":"7620","endPage":"7632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2756668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-Achieving Rate-Compatible Polar Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"Capacity-Achieving Rate-Compatible Polar Codes","volume":"63","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2017","accessionNumber":"17364033","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049513/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049513/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korean Government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"NRF-2017R1C1B1001909"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-Achieving Rate-Compatible Polar Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-maric-2756668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082368S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8114709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8114709","articleId":"8049513","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049514,"authors":[{"name":"Chadwick D.

It does this using two solid-state particle telescopes that have been designed to measure proton and electron fluxes that are the drivers for three of the four primary space environment effects (event total dose, deep-dielectric charging, and single event effects). These telescopes are integrated into a compact package along with space reserved for a planned electrostatic analyzer being developed for the final CEASE 3 design (covering the fourth primary space environment effect-surface charging). The sensors themselves will measure a wider dynamic range in particle flux, provide higher energy resolution, have better out-of-band contamination rejection, and improved diagnostic capability compared to previous CEASE instruments. The CEASE-RR instrument is planned to be launched in 2018 to geostationary orbit as part of an Air Force Research Laboratory flight experiment. The sensor design, calibration, and planned flight experiment objectives are described in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/8263287/08049514.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2017.2756620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2017.2756620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8263287","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor Risk Reduction: A Pathfinder for Operational Energetic Charged Particle Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protons","Space vehicles","Detectors","Extraterrestrial measurements","Telescopes","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace instrumentation","aerospace testing","artificial satellites","calibration","particle detectors","radiation effects","space vehicle electronics","surface charging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state particle telescopes","primary space environment effects","deep-dielectric charging","single event effects","compact package","final CEASE 3 design","particle flux","CEASE-RR instrument","sensor design","compact environmental anomaly sensor risk reduction","operational energetic charged particle sensors","anomaly attribution","space radiation environment","fourth primary space environment effect","surface charging","out-of-band contamination rejection","geostationary orbit","Air Force Research Laboratory flight experiment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrons","geosynchronous","protons","radiation","satellite anomalies","space weather"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor Risk Reduction: A Pathfinder for Operational Energetic Charged Particle Sensors","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8049514/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17472890","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006831","fundingName":"U.S. Air Force through the Space Systems Survivability Program at the Air Force Research Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor Risk Reduction: A Pathfinder for Operational Energetic Charged Particle Sensors","sourcePdf":"tns-lindstrom-2756620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09437S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8263287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8263287","articleId":"8049514","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8049520,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Tao","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049520/tao-2756069-small.gif","p":["Fei Tao received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and the Vice Dean with the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.","His current research interests include service oriented smart manufacturing, manufacturing service management, sustainable manufacturing and digital twin driven product design/manufacturing/service.

At the same time, various national manufacturing development strategies have been put forward, such as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet, manufacturing based on Cyber-Physical System, and Made in China 2025. However, one of specific challenges to achieve smart manufacturing with these strategies is how to converge the manufacturing physical world and the virtual world, so as to realize a series of smart operations in the manufacturing process, including smart interconnection, smart interaction, smart control and management, etc. In this context, as a basic unit of manufacturing, shop-floor is required to reach the interaction and convergence between physical and virtual spaces, which is not only the imperative demand of smart manufacturing, but also the evolving trend of itself. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin shopfloor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data. What is more, the operation mechanisms and implementing methods for DTS are studied and key technologies as well as challenges ahead are investigated, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Production","Manufacturing","Convergence","Data models","Aerospace electronics","Optimization","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manufacturing systems","production engineering computing","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["national manufacturing development strategies","Cyber-Physical System","manufacturing process","virtual spaces","physical shop-floor","virtual shop-floor","shop-floor service system","Digital twin shop-floor","smart manufacturing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart manufacturing","digital twin shop-floor (DTS)","digital twin","virtual shop-floor (VS)","shop-floor service system (SSS)","shop-floor digital twin data (SDTD)","convergence","cyber-physical system (CPS)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756069","startPage":"20418","endPage":"20427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/08049520.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Twin Shop-Floor: A New Shop-Floor Paradigm Towards Smart Manufacturing","topic":"Key Technologies for Smart Factory of Industry 4.0","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Digital Twin Shop-Floor: A New Shop-Floor Paradigm Towards Smart Manufacturing","accessionNumber":"17515825","publicationDate":"2017","volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049520/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51522501"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1101700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program in China","grantNumber":"Z161100004916063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Digital Twin Shop-Floor: A New Shop-Floor Paradigm Towards Smart Manufacturing","sourcePdf":"access-tao-2756069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068627S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Key Technologies for Smart Factory of Industry 4.0"],"articleId":"8049520","onlineDate":"26 September 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":8049521,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China","School of Electronics and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/8049521/liu-2756080-small.gif","p":["Yun Liu received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Nanchang University, Nanchang, China, and the M.S. degree in radio physics from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

As a member of the IM family, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM), which is able to convey additional information bits using the indices of the active subcarriers, has emerged as an attractive physical layer transmission technique. Vector OFDM (V-OFDM) has inherently good peakto-average-power ratio (PAPR) feature and good bit error rate (BER) performance due to the nearly full diversity gains achieved by most of its sub-blocks. In this paper, in order to improve the BER performance of OFDM-IM and reduce the PAPR of the transmit signal, we propose an enhanced OFDM-IM scheme termed vector OFDM with index modulation (V-OFDM-IM). In addition to the structure of the transceiver, a complexity reduced maximum likelihood detector is presented. To further reduce the detection complexity, a near-optimal detector based on sequential Monte Carlo technique is introduced. The average bit error probability of the proposed scheme is derived in closed form over frequency-selective block Rayleigh-fading channel.

The method is applied to design of a broadband high-efficiency power amplifier (PA). The proposed method defines the optimal impedance regions of a PA at several frequency sections over the operational frequency band. These regions contain the impedances that can achieve a high output power and a high-power added efficiency (PAE) simultaneously. A low-pass LC-ladder circuit is selected as the matching network (MN). The element values of the MN can be obtained using a synthesizing method based on stochastic reduced order models and Voronoi partition. The MN provides desired impedance in the predefined optimal impedance region at each frequency section. Thus, optimal output power and PAE of the PA can be achieved. To validate the proposed method, two eighth-order low-pass LC-ladder networks are designed as the input and output MNs, respectively. A gallium nitride (GaN) HEMT from Cree is employed as the active device. Packaging parasitic of the transistor has been taken into account. A PA is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measurement results show that the PA can achieve P1 dB PAE of better than 60% over a fractional bandwidth of 160% (0.2-1.8 GHz). The output power is 42-45 dBm (16-32 W), and the gain is 12-15 dB. The performance of the PA outperforms existing broadband highefficiency PAs in many aspects, which demonstrates the excellence of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2750164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2017.2750164","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1023","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory

A lot of attention has been devoted to the tsunami of data produced by IoT, and the related means of extracting useful actionable information from it, spawning efforts in Big Data processing and machine learning. Yet, all of this does little to address the need for IoT to capture, interpret, and act on this wall of (noisy) information at the right time, at the right place, and in the right form. Conventional computing systems are a poor match to the needs of this emerging massively distributed real-time system. Hence, alternative computing techniques present an attractive alternative, trading off computational resolution for significant gains in quality-of-service energy efficiency and robustness. This observation is based on the conjecture that most applications related to IoT have an inherent error resilience and are evolutionary (that is, learning-based). Alternative computing strategies may be conceived at every level of the design hierarchy, starting from the device level with novel 3-D nonvolatile memory/logic combinations, or at the architectural level by shifting away from the traditional von Neumann architecture to different computing paradigms such as neuromorphic and/or stochastic computation all the way up to the algorithmic and data representation levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 September 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","volume":"25","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049609/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial: Alternative Computing and Machine Learning for Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guest Editorial: Alternative Computing and Machine Learning for Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-firouzi-2742098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059546S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8049574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8049574","articleId":"8049609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8049692,"authors":[{"name":"Liliya Akhtyamova","affiliation":["Institute of Technology Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liliya","lastName":"Akhtyamova","id":"37086197258"},{"name":"Mikhail Alexandrov","affiliation":["Institute of Technology Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Alexandrov","id":"37870709600"},{"name":"John Cardiff","affiliation":["Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, Moscow, Russia","Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Cardiff","id":"37587042300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1051-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1050-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2207-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"8049692","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drugs","Neural networks","Twitter","Hospitals","Sentiment analysis","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drugs","medical computing","neural nets","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adverse drug extraction","Twitter data","health-related topics","social media","adverse medical conditions","mental diseases","medications","convolutional neural networks","CNN","word2vec","adverse drug reactions","neural network algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","Adverse Drug Extraction","Social Media"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049692","abstract":"The study of health-related topics on social media has become a useful tool for the early detection of the different adverse medical conditions.

We show that if the villains do know the secret parts, and/or do not know the secret key, they cannot recuperate the secret. If the attackers do not know the required number of secret parts but know the secret key, the probability that they obtain the secret depends the size of the machine word in bits that is less than 1/2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(1-1)</sup>\n. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures security under several types of attacks. We propose four approaches to select weights for secret sharing schemes to optimize the system behavior based on data access speed: pessimistic, balanced, and optimistic, and on speed per price ratio. We use the approximate method to improve the detection, localization and error correction accuracy under cloud parameters uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2017.44","publicationTitle":"2017 28th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 28th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8047668/8049657/08049702.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2017.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Mitigating Uncertainty of Data Security Breaches and Collusion in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049702/","displayDocTitle":"Towards Mitigating Uncertainty of Data Security Breaches and Collusion in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049702/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209518","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Mitigating Uncertainty of Data Security Breaches and Collusion in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"1051a137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078866S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8047668","isNumber":"8049657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8047668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8049657","articleId":"8049702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049724,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhou","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Institute of Software, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086055702"},{"name":"Mingsheng Ying","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Institute of Software, China"],"firstName":"Mingsheng","lastName":"Ying","id":"37275282400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3217-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3216-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3218-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8303"}],"articleNumber":"8049724","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":971},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Quantum computing","Data privacy","Quantum mechanics","Algorithm design and analysis","Hilbert space","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","quantum computing","quantum noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving operations","depolarization","amplitude/phase damping","privacy protection","private data","quantum noise","quantum information processing","quantum algorithms","quantum computation","differential privacy"]}],"abstract":"More and more quantum algorithms have been designed for solving problems in machine learning, database search and data analytics. An important problem then arises: how privacy can be protected when these algorithms are used on private data? For classical computing, the notion of differential privacy provides a very useful conceptual framework in which a great number of mechanisms that protect privacy by introducing certain noises into algorithms have been successfully developed. This paper defines a notion of differential privacy for quantum information processing. We carefully examine how the mechanisms using three important types of quantum noise, the amplitude/phase damping and depolarizing, can protect differential privacy. A composition theorem is proved that enables us to combine multiple privacy-preserving operations in quantum information processing.","doi":"10.1109/CSF.2017.23","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 30th Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048777/8049639/08049724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSF.2017.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049639","startPage":"249","endPage":"262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Privacy in Quantum Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential Privacy in Quantum Computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049724/","conferenceDate":"21-25 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17213752","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049724/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Privacy in Quantum Computation","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"3217a249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148373S","chronDate":"21-25 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048777","isNumber":"8049639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048777","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8049639","articleId":"8049724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049725,"authors":[{"name":"Ilya Mironov","affiliation":["Google Brain"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Mironov","id":"37085987102"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3217-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3216-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3218-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8303"}],"articleNumber":"8049725","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Privacy","Standards","Tools","Databases","Additives","Computer security","Google"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","differential equations","entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["R\u00e9nyi divergence","privacy definition","privacy loss","differential private mechanisms","analytical tool","differential privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["differential privacy","renyi divergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049725","abstract":"We propose a natural relaxation of differential privacy based on the R\u00e9nyi divergence.

One key advantage is the ability to automatically generate different types of microarchitectures from the original behavioral description. This allows to explore the design space obtaining micro-architectures with unique characteristics. The main problem with previous work on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) Design Space Exploration (DSE) is that the given behavioral description is assumed to be stable and thus, that it has been fully refined a priori. For many application e.g. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) it is not easy to refine the input description as numerous parameters like the number of neurons and layers combined with the duration of the training phase is nontrivial and any changes in these parameters significantly affects the resultant hardware circuit. Thus, this work proposes a tightly integrated two-tier application specific HLS DSE method which explores input parameters of the behavioral description and performs a detailed HLS exploration for the best configurations which meet a set of specified input constraints and then maps the optimal design to a configurable SoC FPGA. A case study using different types of ANNs is presented. The design flow has been fully automated and the experimental results show that our proposed flow is extremely effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209591","htmlLink":"/document/8049776/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application Specific Behavioral Synthesis Design Space Exploration: Artificial Neural Networks.

When designing a cryptographic device for some mission-critical or another reliability demanding system, we need to make the device not only attack-resistant, but also fault-tolerant. There are many common fault-tolerant digital design techniques, however, it is questionable, how these techniques affect the attack-resistance. Do they make the device more vulnerable e.g. to side-channel attacks? In our work we focused on finding the answer to this question. We experimentally evaluated the influence of information redundancy, space redundancy and time redundancy techniques on resistance against power analysis attack. In this paper we present our observations.","publicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048781/8049708/08049794.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2017.76","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2017.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Fault-Tolerance Techniques on Power-Analysis Resistance of Cryptographic Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Fault-Tolerance Techniques on Power-Analysis Resistance of Cryptographic Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049794/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049794/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209549","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Fault-Tolerance Techniques on Power-Analysis Resistance of Cryptographic Design","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"2146a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.167575S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048781","isNumber":"8049708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048781","xplore-issue":"8049708","articleId":"8049794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049795,"authors":[{"name":"Lampros Pyrgas","affiliation":["TEI of Western Greece, Digital IC dEsign and Systems Laboratory (DICES Lab), Greece"],"firstName":"Lampros","lastName":"Pyrgas","id":"37086130136"},{"name":"Filippos Pirpilidis","affiliation":["TEI of Western Greece, Digital IC dEsign and Systems Laboratory (DICES Lab), Greece"],"firstName":"Filippos","lastName":"Pirpilidis","id":"37076921500"},{"name":"Aliki Panayiotarou","affiliation":["Dpt. of Business Administration in Patras, TEI of Western Greece, Greece"],"firstName":"Aliki","lastName":"Panayiotarou","id":"37086133986"},{"name":"Paris Kitsos","affiliation":["TEI of Western Greece, Digital IC dEsign and Systems Laboratory (DICES Lab), Greece","Industrial Systems Institute of \u201cAthena\u201d RIC in ICT and Knowledge Technologies, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Paris","lastName":"Kitsos","id":"37272407300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2146-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2145-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049795","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Trojan horses","Field programmable gate arrays","Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","invasive software","oscillators","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Trojan detection","64-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register","FPGA slices","compact Residue Number System ring counter","control multiplexer","Ring Oscillator","thermal sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese Remainder Theorem","FPGA security","hardware Trojan horse detection","on-chip thermal sensor","ring counter","ring oscillator"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces an efficient technique for the detection of malicious hardware, based on thermal sensors.

For this reason and due to their energy efficiency, Multiprocessor system-on-chips (MPSoC) are becoming ubiquitous. Yet, since these systems are often used in battery-driven and/or small housing use cases, the correct configuration of their power management techniques is an important factor in system design and can be related to possible safety aspects of the system. This calls for an adequate test framework, which is able to observe the power management functionalities of CPS, even before the actual hardware platform is available. The use of virtual platforms for functional validation, that allows executing the CPS's real target platform compatible application binary code on a generic host computer, is currently being adopted by the industry. This work focuses on enhancing industrial OVP virtual platforms by a functional test framework of the power management techniques. We will demonstrate and evaluate how this framework maintains to observe the power management techniques of the system under test. The evaluation uses a Xilinx ZC702 board based on a Xilinx Zynq-7000MPSoC and its correspondent virtual platform in OVP. Results show that the functional test framework is able to analyze the different modes of operation regarding the power management techniques of the Xilinx Zynq processing system.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2017.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2017.14","endPage":"322","publicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048781/8049708/08049803.pdf","startPage":"315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Functional Test Framework to Observe MPSoC Power Management Techniques in Virtual Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049803/","displayDocTitle":"A Functional Test Framework to Observe MPSoC Power Management Techniques in Virtual Platforms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17227627","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049803/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Functional Test Framework to Observe MPSoC Power Management Techniques in Virtual Platforms","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"2146a315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059216S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048781","isNumber":"8049708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048781","xplore-issue":"8049708","articleId":"8049803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049806,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Podivinsky","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Podivinsky","id":"37085407990"},{"name":"Jakub Lojda","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Lojda","id":"37085885740"},{"name":"Ondrej Cekan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Cekan","id":"37085414487"},{"name":"Richard Panek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Panek","id":"37086021533"},{"name":"Zdenek Kotasek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Centre of Excellence IT4Innovations, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Kotasek","id":"37378056100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2146-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2145-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049806","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Fault tolerant systems","Redundancy","Field programmable gate arrays","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","redundancy","reliability","safety-critical software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot controller","safety-critical systems","high economical losses","human health","fault tolerance techniques","experimental electro-mechanical system","statistic reliability analysis","aerospace systems","medical systems","fault avoidance","triple modular redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability Analysis","TMR","FPGA","Fault Tolerance","Robot Controller","Reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"Faults occurring in the safety-critical systems can lead to the failure of the whole system and cause high economical losses or endanger human health.

They are responsible for control, collision avoidance, pilot assistance, target tracking, navigation and communications, amongst other functions. In this industrial field, High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC) applications are becoming highly sophisticated and resource consuming for three reasons. First, they should capture and process real-time data from several I/O sources in parallel. Second, they should adapt their functionalities according to the application or environment variations within given Size Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints. Third, since they process several parallel I/O sources, applications are often distributed on multiple computing nodes making them highly parallel. The problem with current HPEC systems is that, they are usually built to meet the needs of a specific application, i.e., lacks flexibility to upgrade the system or reuse existing hardware resources. Due to the hardware parallelism and I/O bandwidth offered by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), application can be duplicated several times to process parallel I/Os, making Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) the favorite execution model for designers implementing parallel architectures on FPGAs. Furthermore Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) feature allows efficient reuse of limited hardware resources, making FPGA a highly attractive solution for such applications. This paper will address HPEC application design challenges and will discuss some solutions relying on FPGA technologies and referring to several industrial collaborations.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2017.88","startPage":"390","publicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048781/8049708/08049815.pdf","endPage":"395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2017.88","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049815/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Centric High Performance Embedded Computing: Challenges and Trends","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049815/","accessionNumber":"17209590","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Centric High Performance Embedded Computing: Challenges and Trends","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"2146a390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051197S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048781","isNumber":"8049708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048781","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8049708","articleId":"8049815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8049816,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Ebeid","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark"],"firstName":"Emad","lastName":"Ebeid","id":"38233264800"},{"name":"Martin Skriver","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Denmark"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Skriver","id":"37085791780"},{"name":"Jie Jin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Ireland"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085635383"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2146-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2145-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049816","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Drones","Hardware","Open source software","Printed circuits","Robot sensing systems","Licenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost hardware components","embedded electronic component","autonomous control","publicly available open-source flight controllers","academic research","UAV system","software open-source flight controller platforms","unmanned aerial vehicle","commercial applications","drones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","Drones","Flight Controllers","Open Platforms","Survey"]}],"abstract":"Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), so-called drones, have gotten a lot of attention in academic research and commercial applications due to their simple structure, ease of operations and low-cost hardware components.

Parallelism has been widely exploited to reduce such complexity, however most traditional methods do not scale well with the matrix size leading to communication bottlenecks. In this paper we exploit a decentralised parallel hardware architecture based on a strongly non-singular matrix inversion algorithm proposed by Kant and Kimura in 1978, which is a parallel-orientated method with communication mode independent of the matrix size, mitigating the problem of matrix scalability. The hardware architecture is implemented in two different approaches using fixed-point arithmetic: dedicated and shared. In the first approach a matrix can be inverted in linear time while the latter, for the best case, has a square complexity. Experimental results are demonstrated using a Stratix V GX FPGA. For instance, in dedicated approach an 8x8 matrix is inverted in 1.27us, while in shared approach a 64x64 matrix is inverted in 153.40us using 64 pipelined processing elements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8048781/8049708/08049833.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"519","publicationTitle":"2017 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2017.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2017.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Kant and Kimura\u2019s Matrix Inversion Algorithm on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Matrix decomposition","Computer architecture","Clocks","Registers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","logic design","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decentralised parallel hardware architecture","nonsingular matrix inversion algorithm","parallel-orientated method","square complexity","Stratix V GX FPGA","Kant-Kimura matrix inversion algorithm","fixed-point arithmetic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Kant and Kimura\u2019s Matrix Inversion Algorithm on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049833/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209584","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Kant and Kimura\u2019s Matrix Inversion Algorithm on FPGA","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"2146a516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087177S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2017-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8048781","isNumber":"8049708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8048781","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8049708","articleId":"8049833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049840,"authors":[{"name":"Aniseh Dorostkar","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Aniseh","lastName":"Dorostkar","id":"37086153135"},{"name":"Arghavan Asad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Arghavan","lastName":"Asad","id":"37410067200"},{"name":"Mahmood Fathy","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37266676300"},{"name":"Farah Mohammadi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Farah","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37085515878"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2146-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2145-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2147-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049840","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","DRAM chips","energy consumption","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing","SRAM chips","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal placement","heterogeneous uncore component","3D chip-multiprocessors","convex optimization model","stacked hybrid memory system","minimum write energy consumption","STT-RAM memory banks","eDRAM banks","TSVs","embedded CMP","convex model","memory layer","finding optimal number","energy-delay product"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)","Through-Silicon-Vias (TSV)","Uncore component","Dark silicon","Heterogeneous memory architecture","Convex-optimization","3D integration technology"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we present a convex optimization model to design a stacked hybrid memory system contains eDRAM and STT-RAM banks with minimum write energy consumption of STT-RAM memory banks and minimum refresh energy of eDRAM banks with efficient number of TSVs in embedded CMP.

In this study, system identification scheme is developed to obtain a dynamic model of the manipulator in parametric form using Particle Swarm Optimization with Explorer. The introduction of explorer solves problem of getting stuck at local minima, thus proposed a novel methodology namely as Particle Swarm Optimization with Explorer (PSOE).

Compressor circuits based on carry-save logic have been used in past to realize parallel multipliers for ASIC implementation, however, owing to the peculiar architecture of FPGAs, these circuits do not map well on these platforms. In this paper, FPGA implementation of 4:2 compressor circuit is carried out. The compressor architecture considered in this paper involves rippling of carry. This property is exploited by using fast carry-chains to handle the rippling of carry. The use of carry-chain ensures that underlying resources are utilized efficiently. The proposed implementation is compared against traditional approach in terms of resources utilized, speed and power. Both combinational and pipelined implementations are considered. The results indicate that the proposed implementation shows substantial improvement in performance over the traditional approach.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049905","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8045885/8049898/08049905.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving performance speed-up in FPGA based 4:2 compressor using fast carry-chains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049905/","displayDocTitle":"Achieving performance speed-up in FPGA based 4:2 compressor using fast carry-chains","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209239","htmlLink":"/document/8049905/","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving performance speed-up in FPGA based 4:2 compressor using fast carry-chains","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"007camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034176S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049906,"authors":[{"name":"Shopan Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Engineering and Management, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Shopan","lastName":"Dey","id":"37086130925"},{"name":"Ayon Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Engineering and Management, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Ayon","lastName":"Roy","id":"37086133492"},{"name":"Sandip Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, University of Engineering and Management, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Das","id":"37085545227"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2797-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2798-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049906","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":203},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Receivers","Wireless sensor networks","Amplitude shift keying","Mathematical model","Radio frequency","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic communication (telecommunication)","acoustic receivers","amplitude shift keying","error statistics","modems","pulse width modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","PWM","WSN","error-free transmission","multipoint point communication","wireless sensor network","image data transmission","bit error rate","ultrasonic signals","data transfer","ASK","amplitude-shift keying","pulse width modulation","multichannel ultrasonic data communication system","aeronautical single channel communication system","biological effect","human tissue heating","IR technology","RF technology","infrared technology","microwave technology","radiofrequency technology","wireless technology","ultrasonic data communication","multipoint to point acoustic modem","point to point acoustic modem","bandwidth 1 kHz","word length 8 bit","frequency 40 kHz","distance 1 m","bit rate 327 bit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aeronautical ultrasound","bit error rate(BER)","amplitude shift keying(ASK)","pulse width modulation(PWM)","wireless sensor network(WSN)","multipoint to point"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point to point and multipoint to point acoustic modem for ultrasonic data communication","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049898","endPage":"14","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8045885/8049898/08049906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049906","startPage":"10","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049906","abstract":"In today's world the most common wireless technology uses radio frequency(RF), Microwave, infrared(IR) for data communication.

The development of aeronautical single channel and multichannel ultrasonic data communication system is discussed in this paper. Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) followed by Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is implemented successfully. Single channel of bandwidth 1 KHz were used allowing 8 bits of data packet transferred from the transmitter to the receiver concurrently. The rate of data transfer achieved was up to 1 kb/s. A model was designed during the work which could anticipate ultrasonic signals. The carrier frequency of data transmission was 40 KHz. The BitError Rate(BER) of the system was analyzed for different distances. The maximum distance of communication was 1 meter. Through the model designed we have transmitted image data, audio data and text data and received successfully. Further the source point was replaced with multipoint for application of Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) and show that multipoint point communication is possible with a rate of 327 b/s. The conclusion drawn was the oblique angles of less than 7\u00b0and error-free transmission could still be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","accessionNumber":"17209208","htmlLink":"/document/8049906/","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Point to point and multipoint to point acoustic modem for ultrasonic data communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point to point and multipoint to point acoustic modem for ultrasonic data communication","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"025camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057358S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049907,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Shameem Hussain","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Hochschule Karlsruhe \u2013 Technik und Wirtschaft (HsKA), Karlsruhe"],"firstName":"Mohammed Shameem","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37086097891"},{"name":"Christian Langen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Hochschule Karlsruhe \u2013 Technik und Wirtschaft (HsKA), Karlsruhe"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Langen","id":"37085751129"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2797-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2798-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049907","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Radiation detectors","Random access memory","Signal processing algorithms","Delays","Streaming media","Hardware design languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","Haar transforms","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional discrete wavelet transformation","real-time video processing","memory usage","frame delay","memory optimizing architecture","lifting scheme","DWT","HDL coder library","Altera Intel DE2i-150 board","Haar wavelet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrete wavelet transformation","first in first out","counter","combination block","RAM block"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a memory optimizing architecture for FPGA implementation of a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transformation with the lifting scheme for real-time video by processing is proposed.

In this paper, an algorithm to detect multiple targets in OFDM-RADAR environment is proposed. The detection is carried out by utilizing the fact that the problem of detecting targets in OFDM-RADAR environment is similar to that of the problem of detecting spectral components from the noisy observations of a complex exponential function. Further, a maximum likelihood estimator is proposed to estimate range and velocity of multiple targets. Performance of the proposed estimator is quantified by the use of two statistical parameters. From simulations, we confirm superior performance of the proposed detector and estimator for multiple target detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple target detection and estimation of range and Doppler for OFDM-RADAR system","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049910","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8045885/8049898/08049910.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multiple target detection and estimation of range and Doppler for OFDM-RADAR system","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049910/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209213","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple target detection and estimation of range and Doppler for OFDM-RADAR system","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"039camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046403S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049911,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Choudhary","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Choudhary","id":"37086028952"},{"name":"Aastha Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Aastha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086025158"},{"name":"Malay Ranjan Tripathy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Malay Ranjan","lastName":"Tripathy","id":"38242184600"},{"name":"Danniel Ronnow","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Gavle, Gavle, Sweden"],"firstName":"Danniel","lastName":"Ronnow","id":"37086023428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2797-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2798-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049911","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"abstract":"A compact multi band slotted two elements MIMO antenna is designed on FR4 substrate with the dimensions 60\u00d760\u00d71.5 mm3 and an \u03b5r of 4.4.

MIMO provides robustness against multipath fading using spatial diversity gain, and increases data rate by spatial multiplexing gain. These gains are achieved due to the usage of several antennas. This paper presents multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink system under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and heterogeneous user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) profile. MU MIMO essentially provides multiuser diversity gain. System capacity is increased by choosing the users experiencing better channel parameters. We have used normalized SNR based scheduler to select a user for data transmission. The outcomes of these techniques are higher data rate and transmitting long range without need of much power or bandwidth. Alamouti's space time block code (STBC) has been used in this work to increase the transmit diversity, which improves reliability of data transfer. In this paper a comparative performance evaluation of MU MIMO-STBC and MIMO-OFDM has been presented. Moreover the effects of various factors such as imperfection of CSI, heterogeneity of network are investigated for these schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8045885/8049898/08049917.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049898","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER performance of multi user scheduling for MIMO-STBC and MIMO-OFDM broadcast network with imperfect CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Fading channels","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance","multi user scheduling","MIMO-STBC broadcast network","MIMO-OFDM broadcast network","imperfect CSI","multiple-input multiple-output technology","multiuser MIMO downlink system","imperfect channel state information","space time block code","STBC","spatial diversity gain","spatial multiplexing gain","multipath fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","Imperfect CSI","User Scheduling","MIMO-STBC","MIMO-OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"BER performance of multi user scheduling for MIMO-STBC and MIMO-OFDM broadcast network with imperfect CSI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8049917/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209199","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance of multi user scheduling for MIMO-STBC and MIMO-OFDM broadcast network with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"060camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078368S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049927,"authors":[{"name":"Dinesh Prasad","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37085775395"},{"name":"Mainuddin","affiliation":["Department of EEE, GCET, Greater Noida, India"],"lastName":"Mainuddin","id":"37086156537"},{"name":"Laxya","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"lastName":"Laxya","id":"37086155841"},{"name":"S.

An Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) over the FSO communication system is very beneficial to offer high data rate transmission with very low bit rate error (BER) and low amount of multiple access interference (MAI). With a specific end goal to build the number of users and data rate, and to reduce the impact of MAI, this study proposes the OCDMA frameworks. With spectral amplitude coding (SAC) scheme based on zero cross correlation (ZCC) code. This manuscript describes the system SAC OCDMA over FSO communication using pseudo orthogonal (PSO) matrix code is compared to the new zero cross correlation (NZCC) code in terms of BER and Q value at 2.5 Gbps. The simulative results signifies that the optical module based on OCDMAZCC code is better than the system employing PSO matrix code considering the multiple number of users for two different data formats return to zero (RZ) and non-return to zero (NRZ) and different divergences in the range up to 15 km.

Safe operation of automated rail vehicles is of major concern. In this network status and control command are transmitted using WLAN technology. Packet drops are inevitable in CBTC system since WLAN is not suitable for high speed data communication. In present work, analysis of random packet drops in CBTC systems during handover process is evaluated. The existing field work only shows the packet drop result under specific condition, whereas we analyze system behaviour with field parameters by varying one parameter over the range and analyzing its impact on the packet drop and other related parameters of CBTC system. Simulation results are presented and compared against existing field results under specific condition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049997/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17213453","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049997/","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improved system behavior of communication based train control (CBTC) with random packet drops during handover under field condition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved system behavior of communication based train control (CBTC) with random packet drops during handover under field condition","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"306camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066738S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8049999,"authors":[{"name":"Surajit Deka","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Surajit","lastName":"Deka","id":"37086058154"},{"name":"Kandarpa Kumar Sarma","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Kandarpa Kumar","lastName":"Sarma","id":"37604163900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2797-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2798-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8049999","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel coding","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Receivers","Wireless communication","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","combined source-channel coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint source channel coding","MC-CDMA","multi carrier code division multiple access technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","integrity check","receiver control mechanism","channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint source channel coding","Turbo code","Fountain code","MC-CDMA","Walsh code","BPSK modulation","Capacity"]}],"abstract":"In conventional system of wireless communication the source and the channel coding are used in different modules that increases the system complexity, cost and overall processing period. To make it more efficient, both the source and channel coding modules are combined in a single processing block, which not only decreases the system complexity but also reduces the overall processing cost. Multi Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) technique which is a combination of CDMA and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) provides higher capacity. The proposed approach combines joint source channel coding with MC-CDMA. Through integrity check and receiver control mechanism, our system is able to subscribe to a desired broadcast session. The proposed approach result in a capacity which is nearly equals to the upper bound of the ratio C/H where C is the channel capacity and H is the entropy of the source.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049999","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8045885/8049898/08049999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2017.8049999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049898","startPage":"489","endPage":"493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint source channel coding with MC-CDMA in capacity approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint source channel coding with MC-CDMA in capacity approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8049999/","conferenceDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17209182","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8049999/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint source channel coding with MC-CDMA in capacity approach","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"315camerar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093957S","chronDate":"2-3 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8045885","isNumber":"8049898","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8045885","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8049898","articleId":"8049999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"}]
