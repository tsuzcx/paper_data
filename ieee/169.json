Globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) removes the need for global clock net, and also provides efficient means for managing the complexity and re-use in large architectures.

In this paper, we compare our SoC GALS architectures to a synchronous architecture with a fully functional MPEG-4 video encoder on FPGA. The results show that the area and performance overhead of GALS is only 1%. That is negligible compared to the benefits of the GALS architecture such as multiple clock frequencies for intellectual property (IP) blocks and dynamic frequency/voltage scaling, clock tree removal, and re-usability.

In this work we describe a particular scalable architecture of this kind using both standard processor and FPGA processing components. It supports multiple FPGA applications through standard FPGA functions implementing the net-working support, and also provides standard CPU functions on the FPGA for the sequential control of application circuits and for their interfacing to the network. On standard von-Neumann machines, a set of such standard functions implemented with the resources of the machine but not directly available from it, and providing a higher level runtime environment for applications would be called an operating system. After defining the scalable architecture and the runtime support, system design and programming (in particular, of FPGA networks) can be automated. We demonstrate this through a simple algorithm to determine the required mix of components for a given application.

In both stages, we determine the most time-consuming junctions by pinpointing the most computationally intensive or most data-intensive functions. The results of the first stage show that there are eight most time-consuming functions within Bluetooth. The results of the second stage show that (excluding interrupt related functions) the most time-consuming function is memcpy.

In this paper, we review some of the most significant contributions in this area. We then propose a vector architecture to efficiently implement long precision modular multiplications. Having such a data level parallel hardware provides a circuit whose decode and schedule units are at least of the same complexity as those of a scalar processor. The excess transistors are mainly found in the datapath. Moreover, the vector approach gives a very modular architecture where resources can be easily redefined. We built a functional simulator onto which we performed a quantitative analysis to study how the resizing of those resources affects the performance of the modular multiplication operation. Hence we not only propose a vector architecture for our public key cryptographic operations but also show how we can analyze the impact of design choices on performance. The proposed architecture is also flexible in the sense that the software running on it would offer room for the implementation of counter-measures against side-channel or fault attacks","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2006.58","publicationTitle":"9th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11117/35632/01690071.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2006.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Software Codesign of a Vector Co-processor for Public Key Cryptography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1690071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1690071/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Software Codesign of a Vector Co-processor for Public Key Cryptography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9240402","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1690071/","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Software Codesign of a Vector Co-processor for Public Key Cryptography","confLoc":"Cavtat, Croatia","sourcePdf":"01690071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058182S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11117","isNumber":"35632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11117","xplore-issue":"35632","articleId":"1690071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1690074,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The results show that in FPGAs, the efficiency of savings in dynamic power consumption is about 50% to 80% of its ASIC counterparts.

A commercially available server and serial ATA card are used for the demonstration, without any change for an operating system, device driver, PCIe interface, and Ethernet switch.

Traditional mapping approaches have become increasingly inaccurate because many applications use non-default or ephemeral port numbers, use well-known port numbers associated with other applications, change application signatures or use traffic encryption. Other proposed identification approaches are based on the analysis and interpretation of the packet contents, but they have important drawbacks related to their high processing requirements and their inability to deal with confidentiality requirements. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to solve the problem of application detection and at the same time can predict the traffic level associated with each application based on the overall aggregated traffic, while overcoming the limitations of the previous approaches","doi":"10.1109/ICNS.2006.38","startPage":"95","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"International conference on Networking and Services (ICNS'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNS.2006.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35640","displayPublicationTitle":"International conference on Networking and Services (ICNS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11125/35640/01690565.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Internet Applications using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1690565/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting Internet Applications using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1690565/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9188690","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Internet Applications using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Silicon Valley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01690565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067076S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11125","isNumber":"35640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11125","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35640","articleId":"1690565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1690650,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Shestak","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Shestak","id":"38366002600"},{"name":"Jay Smith","affiliation":["IBM, Boulder, CO, USA","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Smith","id":"37277158600"},{"name":"H.

Determining a resource allocation that accounts for this uncertainty in a way that can provide a probabilistic guarantee that a given level of quality of service (QoS) is achieved is an important research problem. This paper defines a stochastic methodology for quantifiably determining a resource allocation's ability to satisfy QoS constraints in the midst of uncertainty in system parameters. Uncertainty in system parameters and its impact on system performance are modeled stochastically. This stochastic model is then used to derive a quantitative expression for the robustness of a resource allocation.

In this paper, we present fast parallel implementations of three fundamental graph theory problems, breadth-first search, st-connectivity and shortest paths for unweighted graphs, on multithreaded architectures such as the Cray MTA-2. The architectural features of the MTA-2 aid the design of simple, scalable and high-performance graph algorithms. We test our implementations on large scale-free and sparse random graph instances, and report impressive results, both for algorithm execution time and parallel performance. For instance, breadth-first search on a scale-free graph of 400 million vertices and 2 billion edges takes less than 5 seconds on a 40-processor MTA-2 system with an absolute speedup of close to 30. This is a significant result in parallel computing, as prior implementations of parallel graph algorithms report very limited or no speedup on irregular and sparse graphs, when compared to the best sequential implementation","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2006.34","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11126/35641/01690657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2006.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35641","startPage":"523","endPage":"530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Multithreaded Algorithms for Breadth-First Search and st-connectivity on the Cray MTA-2","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1690657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Designing Multithreaded Algorithms for Breadth-First Search and st-connectivity on the Cray MTA-2","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1690657/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9165334","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1690657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Multithreaded Algorithms for Breadth-First Search and st-connectivity on the Cray MTA-2","confLoc":"Columbus, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"26360523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080678S","chronDate":"14-18 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11126","isNumber":"35641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11126","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"35641","articleId":"1690657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1690685,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Based on the Kalman filter channel estimator, softinput- soft-output (SISO) minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer and a maximum posterior probability (MAP) decoder, the channel estimate can be improved for each iteration by using soft information feedback from the decoder. Computer simulations show good estimation and tracking by the Kalman filter with only a few training (pilot) symbols even when signals experience deep fading. It is observed from simulations that the overall system performance can be improved by 4dB after 14 iterations compared to non-iterative channel estimation and equalization.

The emphasis of this work is placed on the data integrity and accuracy problem caused by compromised or malfunctioning nodes. One of the key features of the proposed approach is that it provides an integrated methodology of taking into consideration and combining effectively correlated sensor data, in a distributed fashion, in order to reveal anomalies that span through a number of neighboring sensors. Furthermore, it allows the integration of results from neighboring network areas to detect correlated anomalies/attacks that involve multiple groups of nodes. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a real use case that utilizes meteorological data collected from a distributed set of sensor nodes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Anomaly Detection in Distributed Large-Scale Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2006.1691116","displayPublicationTitle":"11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11130/35645/01691116.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2006.1691116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1691116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1691116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Anomaly Detection in Distributed Large-Scale Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1691116/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Anomaly Detection in Distributed Large-Scale Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"01691116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046078S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11130","isNumber":"35645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11130","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"35645","articleId":"1691116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1691126,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-mei Liu","affiliation":["The Mobile Communications Laboratory, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","NJUPT, The Mobile Communications Laboratory, Nanjing, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Sheng-mei Liu","id":"38275987200"},{"name":"G.

Although it is a widely accepted that multi-hopping increases cellular capacity, it has never been quantified. In this paper, the capacity increase in multi-hop CDMA cellular networks is quantified. To this end, and since CDMA networks are interference limited, we derive equations for interference in multi-hop cellular networks at base stations (BSs) and relaying mobile terminals (MTs) in the uplink. The interference formulas are used to verify that capacity can be increased, by increasing either the number of simultaneous calls or data rate. A 10% increase in the number of simultaneous calls is shown to be possible even under worst-case scenarios. This increase is achievable while keeping interference at relaying MTs below acceptable thresholds. The novelty of this paper is that it quantifies, and for the first time, interference levels at MTs and BSs as well as potential capacity enhancements.","displayPublicationTitle":"11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11130/35645/01691127.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"837","publicationTitle":"11th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ISCC.2006.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCC.2006.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1691127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Enhancement in CDMA Cellular Networks using Multi-hop Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Spread spectrum communication","Interference","Relays","Proposals","Repeaters","Computer networks","Telecommunication computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1691127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Enhancement in CDMA Cellular Networks using Multi-hop Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1691127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Enhancement in CDMA Cellular Networks using Multi-hop Communication","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"01691127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048421S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11130","isNumber":"35645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11130","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"35645","articleId":"1691127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1691156,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Low Density Parity Check codes over Z_8, the group of integers modulo 8, are considered. When applied to 8-PSK, they generate geometrically uniform Euclidean space codes: distance profile and word error probability are the same for each transmitted codeword. These properties highly simplify both design and analysis.

We then developed an automated transformation tool that can generate functional code by transforming generic RTOS APIs into RTOS-specific APIs.

The method first estimates the channel transfer function at the same subcarrier with an interpolator in time direction, and then processes the received pilots in both multipath spread domain and Doppler spread domain. In this way, it significantly reduces the inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to time-variant shortwave channel and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Moreover, with the sliding window and adjustable sliding step, it can effectively handle the case of different path number as well as different path delays, which demonstrates our method's robust feature.

A chaotic system in general cannot be made to converge to a freely evolving desired trajectory, whether periodic or chaotic, because of the inherent unpredictability of the system. The control of chaos in this context consists of forcing the system to evolve along the desired trajectory.

Numerical examples are given to illustrate the significant improvement on the conservativeness of the delay bound over some reported results in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2006.13","startPage":"591","endPage":"594","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35656","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11141/35656/01691869.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Delay-Dependent Approach to Robust Stability for Uncertain Hybrid Bidirectional Associative Memory Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1691869/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Delay-Dependent Approach to Robust Stability for Uncertain Hybrid Bidirectional Associative Memory Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1691869/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9132256","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Delay-Dependent Approach to Robust Stability for Uncertain Hybrid Bidirectional Associative Memory Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01691869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08641S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11141","isNumber":"35656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11141","xplore-issue":"35656","articleId":"1691869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1691875,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Fang","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent and High Performance Computing School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, China"],"lastName":"Wei Fang","id":"37087373240"},{"name":"Jun Sun","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent and High Performance Computing School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, China"],"lastName":"Jun Sun","id":"37087143433"},{"name":"Wenbo Xu","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent and High Performance Computing School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Xu","id":"37087182075"},{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent and High Performance Computing School of Information Technology, Southern Yangtze University, China"],"lastName":"Jing Liu","id":"37087167453"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2616-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1691875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1691875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Particle swarm optimization","Design optimization","Genetic algorithms","Convergence","Sun","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing","search problems","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR digital filter design","quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","multiparameter optimization","QPSO","stochastic search technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2006.77","pdfPath":"/iel5/11141/35656/01691875.pdf","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","startPage":"615","endPage":"619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR Digital Filters Design Based on Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"FIR digital filters design involves multi-parameter optimization, on which the existing optimization algorithm doesn't work efficiently.

Recently, there were many researchers proposed radial basis function-based (RBF) methods to deal with image classification. However, the traditional RBF neural networks were sensitive to center initialization. To obtain appropriate centers, it needs to find the significant features for further RBF clustering. In addition, the training procedure of the traditional RBF is time-consuming. In order to cope with these problems, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is proposed to select more appropriate centers for RBF network, and a modular RBF (MRBF) neural network is proposed to improve the classification rate and speed up the training time. The experimental results show that the proposed MRBF network has better performance than DWTbased method, traditional RBF neural network and the Tree Structured Wavelet (TWS) in image classification. The experimental results also show that the training time of proposed MRBF neural network is much faster than the traditional RBF neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1691979/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9132357","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1691979/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Image Classification using a Module RBF Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Classification using a Module RBF Neural Network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01691979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042549S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11141","isNumber":"35657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11141","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"35657","articleId":"1691979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1691984,"authors":[{"name":"K.

When the host image has been tampered with, the feature information can be used to restore the original image. However, it does not have the ability to verify the ownership of the copyright. In this article, an image watermarking scheme with tamper detection, and recovery is proposed. The main goal is to detect and recover the tampered region accurately. In addition, the proposed method has robustness to resist the attacks of JPEG compression and cropping. This is a novel scheme because it has the functions of tamper detection and recovery, while having the main advantage of robust watermarking. Experimental results further demonstrate that our proposed technique is an efficient method to verify the ownership and recover the tampered region","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete cosine transforms","Robustness","Resists","Transform coding","Image coding","Copyright protection","Computer science","Image restoration","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image watermarking scheme","tamper detection","tamper recovery","feature information embedding","host image","JPEG compression","JPEG cropping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2006.414","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11141/35658/01692120.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Image Watermarking Scheme with Tamper Detection and Recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1692120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Image Watermarking Scheme with Tamper Detection and Recovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692120/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1692120/","accessionNumber":"9132482","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Image Watermarking Scheme with Tamper Detection and Recovery","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"01692120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040998S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11141","isNumber":"35658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11141","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"35658","articleId":"1692120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1692144,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Li","affiliation":["Ool of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, China"],"lastName":"Gang Li","id":"37087144076"},{"name":"Ruili Zeng","affiliation":["Ool of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, China"],"lastName":"Ruili Zeng","id":"37087186496"},{"name":"Ling Lin","affiliation":["Ool of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, China"],"lastName":"Ling Lin","id":"37087187363"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2616-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1692144","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Licenses","Neural networks","Color","Filters","Histograms","Image segmentation","Intelligent transportation systems","Character recognition","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image classification","image colour analysis","image resolution","image segmentation","neural nets","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle license plate location","neural network","grey-level image segmentation","color image edge extraction","pixel color classification","vertical projection histogram"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1692144","abstract":"There are some usual methods in vehicle license plate location, such as segmentation in grey-level image, color image edge extraction and neural networks filters etc. All these methods are proved not quite satisfactory in various conditions, or are influenced by some factors.

Generally, the robust watermark is used for the purpose of ownership protection. But if the robust watermark is tampered or faked by malicious attacker, even though the robust watermark is exactly extracted from watermarked image, it can not verify the ownership. In our algorithm, we embed the reversible watermark into the robust watermark. Through the watermark extracted from the robust watermark, we can verify its authenticity. Generally, the purpose of reversible data embedding is authentication and reversibility of image. But in our approach, reversible watermark is embedded into the robust watermark. We focus on authentication and reversibility of the robust watermark. If the watermark extracted from the robust watermark is authenticated, the watermark is used to restore the embedding distortion. The proposed algorithm is capable of not only the authentication of robust watermark but also the restoration of the robust watermark from the embedding distortion.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.510","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11141/35658/01692219.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"490","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2006.510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible Data Embedding for Tamper-Proof Watermarks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Reversible Data Embedding for Tamper-Proof Watermarks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1692219/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9132549","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692219/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible Data Embedding for Tamper-Proof Watermarks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01692219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048038S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11141","isNumber":"35658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11141","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"35658","articleId":"1692219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1692261,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Ying","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Liu Ying","id":"37087160580"},{"name":"Gu Yanfeng","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Gu Yanfeng","id":"37087745800"},{"name":"Zhang Ye","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Ye","id":"37087438637"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2616-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1692261","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1692261","abstract":"Feature selection and extraction are important applications of hyperspectral images. In this paper, a new algorithm, Selective Principal Component Analysis based on Genetic Algorithm with Subgroups (SPCA-GAS) is proposed. This algorithm has the distinct characteristic of combining feature selection and extraction together via the introduction of subgroup concept. SPCA-GAS tries to solve the problem of how many and which bands should be selected for feature extraction (Principal Component Analysis, PCA), and then the transformed features are used for classification. Concretely, bands with high separability are first selected and then transformed to remove correlation between them. In this way, useful features with high separability and no correlation are obtained, which help to improve classification accuracies compared with traditional feature selection and extraction methods. Numerical experiments are conducted on AVIRIS data with 100 bands, and satisfying results are reached by SPCA-GAS.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIC.2006.459","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11141/35658/01692261.pdf","publicationTitle":"First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Feature Extraction using Selective PCA based on Genetic Algorithm with Subgroups","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Principal component analysis","Genetic algorithms","Hyperspectral imaging","Data mining","Diversity reception","Spectroscopy","Image processing","Focusing","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","genetic algorithms","image classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral feature extraction","selective principal component analysis","subgroup based genetic algorithm","feature selection","hyperspectral image classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692261/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Feature Extraction using Selective PCA based on Genetic Algorithm with Subgroups","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1692261/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-1 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9132569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Feature Extraction using Selective PCA based on Genetic Algorithm with Subgroups","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01692261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074858S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11141","isNumber":"35658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11141","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"35658","articleId":"1692261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1692508,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Bit-serial decoding also facilitates efficient implementation of wordlength-programmable LDPC decoding which is essential for gear shift decoding. To simplify the implementation of bit-serial decoding we propose a new approximation to the check update function in the min-sum decoding algorithm.

However, its performance degrades significantly while multiple access interference (MAI) is present. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity adaptive filtering scheme to solve the problem. The proposed scheme comprises two adaptive filters, an adaptive spatial and an adaptive temporal filter. With a special structure, the spatial filter can act as a beamformer suppressing interference, while the temporal filter can act as a code-delay estimator. A criterion is proposed for minimization such that these filters can simultaneously adjusted by a constrained least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. The proposed system is simple and it can acquire both the code-delay and direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the desired user. The performance as well as the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Closed-form expressions for optimum filters and steady-state mean-squared errors (MSE) are derived.

The FTS is a fast block-matching algorithm for motion estimation proposed in previous work, which can be used for video compression. The FTS finds the best matching blocks between two frames using a search triangle which changes its direction and size through a set of operations. These operations provide the triangle with the necessary flexibility to locate the best matching block. Simulation results indicate that the FTS reduces the number of block matching operations compared with other fast block matching algorithms without affecting quality or compression ratio of the compressed bitstream. In this paper, a hardware architecture for a FPGA implementation of the FTS algorithm is proposed. This architecture is simulated and tested using VHDL and synthesized using Xilinx ISE for the Xilinx Spartan3 device. The results obtained were compared to an FPGA implementation of the full search (FS) algorithm. Results indicates that the FTS FPGA implementation requires less number of gates than FS and the required number of cycles needed to complete motion search for one block is much lower.

The integration of these advanced materials results in significant reduction of signal delay and power dissipation compared to conventional silicon dioxide. As the technology continues to advance, the implementation of low-k dielectrics for the 65 nm node (Luo, et al., 2004) causes also problems, when using backend of line (BEOL) capacitors in mixed signal circuits.

Since readers are programmed to detect tags at increasing transmitting power (and provide binary tag/no tag information), we take advantage of the reader interrogation results to develop a Bayesian model for tags localization. By testing the solution with off-the-shelf UHF tags were experimented the accuracy of the method that, in a 5mtimes4m environment, provides an average error in localization of about 0.6 meters.

An experimental demonstration using a simple 0.35/spl mu/m BiCMOS transimpedance amplifier further confirms the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692735","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"918","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01692735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General model for delayed feedback and its application to transimpedance amplifier's bandwidth optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"General model for delayed feedback and its application to transimpedance amplifier's bandwidth optimization","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1692735/","accessionNumber":"9086247","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692735/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General model for delayed feedback and its application to transimpedance amplifier's bandwidth optimization","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01692735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038309S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1692735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1692743,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Both chips have 100 times 100 pixels. Using the orientation-selective outputs obtained from the multi-chip system, texture segregation was conducted based on a computational model inspired by neurophysiology. The texture image was filtered by the two orthogonally oriented receptive fields of the multi-chip system and the filtered images were combined to segregate the area of different texture orientation with the aid of field programmable gate array (FPGA).

As a consequence, signal wires exhibit a significant delay variation and noise immunity problems. This problem is aggravated for long on-chip buses. In this paper, we develop memory-based crosstalk canceling CODECs for on-chip buses. We describe an reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) based methodology to accurately compute the bus area overhead of the CODECs. We report the asymptotic overhead for CODECs which cancel three kinds of crosstalk patterns, and demonstrate that the bus size overheads are lower than the corresponding overheads for a memoryless CODEC. This results in a reduced overall area utilization for memory-based crosstalk canceling CODECs, compared to their memoryless counterparts. We also demonstrate that the use of these crosstalk canceling CODECs enables a user to speed up a bus by a factor of over 6/spl times/. Further, by using our techniques, a user may trade off the speed gain against the attendant bus size overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692786","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"4 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01692786.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","Crosstalk","Wires","Delay","Encoding","Capacitance","Data structures","Boolean functions","Wiring","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","crosstalk","binary decision diagrams","field buses","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip buses","cross-coupling capacitance","on-chip wires","delay variation","noise immunity problem","memory based crosstalk canceling CODECs","reduced ordered binary decision diagram","crosstalk patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Memory-based crosstalk canceling CODECs for on-chip buses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692786/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1692786/","accessionNumber":"9062300","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory-based crosstalk canceling CODECs for on-chip buses","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01692786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063975S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1692786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1692788,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, for high transmission rates a straight forward exhaustive search implementation suffers from prohibitive complexity. The K-best algorithm provides close-to-ML bit error rate (BER) performance, while its circuit complexity is reduced compared to an exhaustive search. In this paper, a new VLSI architecture for the implementation of the K-best algorithm is presented. Instead of the mostly sequential processing that has been applied in previous VLSI implementations of the algorithm, the presented solution takes a more parallel approach. Furthermore, the application of a simplified norm is discussed.

The sphere decoding algorithm (SDA) has been used for maximum likelihood (ML) detection in MIMO systems. However, it suffers from variable computation complexity and non-fixed throughput. Therefore, the k-best sphere decoding algorithm is proposed for MIMO detections for its less complexity and fixed throughput. The disadvantage for k-best SDA is that it has performance loss due to the reason that ML detection is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose some improved k-best sphere decoding algorithms which improve the MIMO detection performance. Simulation results show that by applying sorted QR decomposition for the channel matrix, and/or introducing dynamic K values for different layers, our improved algorithms can achieve 1-2 dB detection performance gain for 4 times 4 64QAM MIMO systems over the traditional k-best SDA without introducing extra computational complexity","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692796","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01692796.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"1162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved k-best sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1692796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Improved k-best sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692796/","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","accessionNumber":"9086645","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1692796/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved k-best sphere decoding algorithms for MIMO systems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01692796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082959S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1692796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1692797,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Nan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Nan Yeh","id":"37419516400"},{"name":"Yen-Tai Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Engineering Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Tai Lai","id":"37277036000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9389-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"1692797","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","CMOS image sensors","Clocks","Power dissipation","Switches","Capacitance","Image analysis","Analytical models","Circuit simulation","Leakage current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","CMOS image sensors","leakage currents","low-power electronics","readout electronics","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power readout control circuit","high resolution CMOS image sensor","shift-register-based control circuit","clock tree","autonomous clock gating technique","clock supply system","dynamic power dissipation","static power dissipation","leakage current","stack effect technique"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a low power, shift-register-based, readout control circuit for high resolution CMOS image sensors.

Additionally, from our analysis and simulations, the dynamic power dissipation is demonstrated to increase in proportion to the logarithm of the size of an imager.

The device under test is an actual working 30W PA operating at 881.5 MHz. An in-house DPD algorithm is implemented on an Altera Stratix II EP2S60 DSP development board. As the number of bits is decreased from 14 to 10, it is found that the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) at the PA output has no noticeable degradation.

The importance of the topic stems from the recent advances in the conceptual design and manufacturing technologies of the next-generation wireless and mobile communication systems, which will operate over ultra-wide frequency bands. In fact, for all communication systems, construction of wide-band power transfer networks is essential. Therefore, in this manuscript, new procedures to design broadband matching network are covered, and a design roadmap is given with relevant recommendations.

An image coding approach is proposed in which a number of regions of the input image are skipped at the encoder and are recovered through the inpainting process at the decoder. Furthermore, a structure-aware inpainting (SAI) method is developed to restore the skipped structural regions by taking advantage of the available portion of the decoded image. A binary structure map is extracted and compressed into the generated bit-stream to indicate the skipped regions with salient structures. By making use of the decoded texture information together with the structure map, the SAI method can recover the skipped structural regions as well as the non-structural ones effectively at the decoder. Compared with JPEG, our proposed image compression scheme allows smaller file, with the potential of up to 50% bit-saving capability, at similar visual quality levels","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01692960.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression with structure-aware inpainting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Image compression with structure-aware inpainting","htmlLink":"/document/1692960/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","accessionNumber":"9062388","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression with structure-aware inpainting","confLoc":"Island of Kos","sourcePdf":"01692960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063689S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1692960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":1692961,"authors":[{"name":"V.

However, most of these techniques apply to single noise source, and cannot take into account the evolving reality of multiple noise sources interacting with each other. With the scaling of the technology into nanometer regime, maintaining historical rate of performance and signal integrity have become very challenging due to compound noise effects. Noise measurement made at an evaluation node will reflect the cumulative effect of all the active noise sources, while individual and relative severity of various noise sources will determine what types of remedial steps can be adopted, pressing the need for the development of algorithms that study the cumulative noise effects, and analyze the relative contributions of different noise sources. This paper presents a novel method to analyze the characteristics of compound noise effect in very high performance integrated circuits. The algorithm extracts the time characteristics of individual noise sources from the measured voltage in order to study the contribution of each source separately, by applying the technique of blind source separation, which is based on the assumption that the different sources of noise are statistically independent over time. The estimated noise sources can aid in timing and spectral analysis and yield better design techniques","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compound noise analysis in digital circuits using blind source separation","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692988","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01692988.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"1932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1692988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1692988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1692988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Compound noise analysis in digital circuits using blind source separation","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1692988/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9076186","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compound noise analysis in digital circuits using blind source separation","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01692988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044584S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1692988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1692992,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Accidents caused by drivers' drowsiness have a high fatality rate due to the decline of drivers' abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control abilities while sleepy. Preventing such an accident requires a technique for detecting, estimating, and predicting the level of alertness of a driver and a mechanism to maintain the driver's maximum performance of driving. The ICAFNN is a fuzzy neural network (FNN) capable of parameter self-adapting and structure self-constructing to acquire a small number of fuzzy rules for interpreting the embedded knowledge of a system from the given training data set. Our experiments show that the ICAFNN can achieve significant improvements in the accuracy of drowsiness estimation compared with our previous works.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693037","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"2128","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693037.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver's drowsiness estimation by combining EEG signal analysis and ICA-based fuzzy neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Signal analysis","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Vehicle safety","Road accidents","Vehicle driving","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy systems","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","medical image processing","feature extraction","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy logic","road accidents","independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver drowsiness estimation","EEG signal analysis","fuzzy neural networks","ICAFNN","public security","vehicle control","traffic accident fatalities","self-adaptive systems","training data set","independent component analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Driver's drowsiness estimation by combining EEG signal analysis and ICA-based fuzzy neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9086284","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver's drowsiness estimation by combining EEG signal analysis and ICA-based fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056964S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1693038,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Data compression is being efficiently used to process multichannel recordings. This paper explores discrete wavelet transform (DWT) processor architectures suited to compress ENGs and so, increase the number of channels. Low power consumption, low silicon area and specificity of multichannel neural recording systems are considered for this investigation. Six architectures were implemented and compared. All of them implement a 3 level Daubechies-4 wavelet decomposition. This comparative study allows to conclude that an excellent trade-off between power consumption and silicon area is obtained through a DWT polyphase structure using a careful balance of parallelism and folding. Also, it arises that multiplexing several channels toward a shared DWT processor provides the best savings for both, power and area","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693038.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"2132","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transforms dedicated to compress recorded ENGs from multichannel implants: comparative architectural study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Implants","Discrete wavelet transforms","Energy consumption","Frequency","Silicon","Equations","Convolution","Filter bank","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical electronics","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","low-power electronics","medical signal processing","microprocessor chips","neurophysiology","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ENG compression","electroneurogram recording","multichannel implant","multichannel neural recording","data compression","discrete wavelet transform","processor architectures","Daubechies-4 wavelet decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transforms dedicated to compress recorded ENGs from multichannel implants: comparative architectural study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693038/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9076219","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transforms dedicated to compress recorded ENGs from multichannel implants: comparative architectural study","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.205017S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1693039,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.Y.

In this method, the total amount of charge per stimulation phase can be controlled by changing the initial and final capacitor voltages as well as the number of capacitors being discharged. The rate of discharge, which is the stimulus current, is also a controllable parameter that adds more flexibility to this stimulation approach, while improving the implant safety. The key reason for adopting SCS in implantable low-power devices was to combine the power efficiency of the voltage-controlled stimulators (VCS) with the safety and stimulation parameter controllability of the current-controlled stimulation (CCS) circuits. In addition, the SCS technique substantially simplifies the microstimulator architecture, and depending on the application, can potentially reduce the implant size and power requirements. It also provides an opportunity to apply different stimulus waveforms to the excitable tissue that can be more efficacious in activating the surrounding nerve or muscle fibers compared to the commonly used square-shaped pulses","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693055","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693055.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched-capacitor based implantable low-power wireless microstimulating systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693055/","displayDocTitle":"Switched-capacitor based implantable low-power wireless microstimulating systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9055557","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693055/","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-capacitor based implantable low-power wireless microstimulating systems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053311S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1693065,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The VTC architecture uses current starved inverters where the inverter delay versus input voltage characteristic is linearized by using several parallel current starving devices with different gate bias voltages and different amounts of source degeneration. The VTC operates at a clock frequency of up to 500 MHz. Input voltage signals of up to 2 GHz can be converted to pulse time delays by using several VTC's in parallel. Since the voltage to time conversion is essentially done with a single inverter stage no sample-and-hold is needed for the input voltage.

The IS technique removes unwanted shaking phenomenon in image sequences captured by hand-held camcorders. It includes two main parts such as motion estimation and compensation. Most of computation power occurs in the part of motion estimation. In order to reduce this complexity, an idea, which integrates an adaptive-threshold method and cellular neural networks (CNN) architecture, is designed to improve this problem.

This paper presents a novel lossless parallel image coding method based on lifting scheme using DT-CNNs. In the proposed method, split steps of the lifting scheme are extended in order to achieve fast image compression by parallel processing, and the subsampled image is interpolated by using the nonlinear interpolative dynamics of DT-CNN. Since the output function of DT-CNN works as a multi-level quantization function, the proposed method composes the integer lifting scheme for lossless coding.

However, a chip multiprocessor dedicated to the inverse problem to the one-way function is nonexistent although a single-chip processor consuming limited power is useful in realizing a high-speed solver. In this paper, we propose a new chip multiprocessor operating with a procedure similar to that of quantum computing. The chip multiprocessor is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and the factorization of a 64-bit integer is demonstrated. As a result, the proposed processor reduces the calculation time by 35% compared with a general-purpose processor with 3.4GHz clock frequency.

In traditional VLC decoding algorithms, we could search a level in Huffman coding tree per operation. Therefore, the throughput rate is limited by the searching level. The CAVLC algorithm takes the advantage of the trend among AC coefficients in each block to predict the next codeword. The prediction mechanism can significantly improve the decoding efficiency. Hence, we suggested two efficient approaches, table partitioning and prefix predecoding, to reduce the power consumption in decoding the VLC codes. The proposed low-power CAVLD architecture achieves the real-time requirement for 720p HD (1280times720) format, while the clock is operated at 125 MHz.

We present measurements from a test chip, characterizing all the modules of the circuit and show how they match well with theoretical expectations. We finally demonstrate that the learning mechanism of the synapse is fully functional by stimulating it with Poisson distributed spike trains","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693200","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","startPage":"4 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI spike-driven dynamic synapse which learns only when necessary","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI spike-driven dynamic synapse which learns only when necessary","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693200/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9062386","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1693200/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI spike-driven dynamic synapse which learns only when necessary","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071841S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1693201,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Finding the optimum word length for digital systems is a difficult problem because the trade-off between hardware cost and system performance is not conclusive. Actual digital systems prepare a more than enough word length in circuit design level to avoid the worst condition caused by lack of dynamic range. It indicates that they still have room to reduce power during better conditions. We propose tunable word length architecture (TWA) that dynamically changes its own word length according to communication environments. The proposed OFDM demodulator measures error vector magnitude (EVM) from de-modulated signals and tunes a word length to satisfy required quality of communication by monitoring the EVM performance. Our result reports that the demodulator reduced dissipated energy by the maximum 32% and 24% in AWGN and multipath fading channels, respectively, compared to use of a fixed word length","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693203","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693203.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable word length architecture for low power wireless OFDM demodulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693203/","displayDocTitle":"Tunable word length architecture for low power wireless OFDM demodulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9062218","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693203/","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable word length architecture for low power wireless OFDM demodulator","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071884S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1693205,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The individual generators share a master current reference. A serial digital interface to the chip controls the biases by bits loaded into a 24-bit shift register. These bits control the steering of current from a current splitter. The summed current splitter output is actively mirrored to a broadcasted bias voltage. Measurements from an implementation in 0.35mu 4M-2P CMOS show a total range of bias current of over 6 decades (>120 dB) ranging from a few times the off-current up to the master reference current. For currents larger than the minimum, the generator has resolution spanning nearly its full 24 bit range (144dB), e.g. for a master current of 10 muA, any bias current can be varied by as little as 0.5 pA with the caveat that the code is not guaranteed monotonic.

One of the key remaining challenges for a successful implementation of the EER technique is the efficient implementation of the switching power converter in charge of amplifying the baseband envelope signal, since bandwidths in the order of several MHz are expected for the envelopes to be tracked, hence requiring very high switching frequencies and thus compromising efficiency. This work investigates the feasibility of the EER technique by studying the impact of the nonidealities associated to the switching power converter, namely its bandwidth and ripple, upon the overall polar amplification EER scheme.

An ESN consists of a reservoir of conventional processing elements, which are recurrently interconnected with untrained random weights, and a readout layer, which is trained using linear regression methods. The key advantage of the ESN is the ability to model systems without the need to train the recurrent weights. In this paper, we use an ESN to model the production of speech signals in a classification experiment using isolated utterances of the English digits \"zero\" through \"nine.\" One prediction model for each digit was trained using frame-based speech features (cepstral coefficients) from all train utterances, and the readout layer consisted of several linear regressors which were trained to target different portions of the time series using a dynamic programming algorithm (Viterbi). Each novel test utterance was classified with the label from the digit model with the minimum mean squared prediction error. Using a corpus of 4130 isolated digits from 8 male and 8 female speakers, the highest classification accuracy attained with an ESN was 100.0% (99.1%) on the train (test) set, compared to 100% (94.7%) for a hidden Markov model (HMM). HMM performance increased to 100.0% (99.8%) when context features (first- and second-order temporal derivatives) were appended to the cepstral coefficients. The ESN offers an attractive alternative to the HMM because of the ESN's simple train procedure, low computational requirements, and inherent ability to model the dynamics of the signal under study","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693294","endPage":"3156","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693294.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum mean squared error time series classification using an echo state network prediction model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693294/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum mean squared error time series classification using an echo state network prediction model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9086473","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1693294/","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum mean squared error time series classification using an echo state network prediction model","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080114S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1693295,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The developed theoretical results are further illustrated by numerical examples, including their superiority over the existing results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693318/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9062232","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693318/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study of complete stability for delayed cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of complete stability for delayed cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062424S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1693319,"authors":[{"name":"F.

To minimize hardware costs and memory requirements of such encoders, a class of high-performance quasi-cyclic LDPC codes which can be encoded in linear time has been proposed by designing the parity check matrix in a triangular plus dual-diagonal form. Based on the proposed codes, parallel architectures and pipelining technology have been used to increase the throughput of encoders. Moreover, collisions which occur when parallel processors contend for write access to the same memory module are avoided by exploiting an iterative encoding approach which involves repeated usage of the processors.

This is based on designing a corresponding seed infinite precision coefficient digital filter (through continuous optimization), and on quantizing the resulting multiplier coefficients into single-digit DBNS coefficients via a look-up table. The resulting digital filter is encoded into a chromosome which is perturbed to form an initial population for the genetic algorithm. The salient feature of the resulting genetic algorithm is that it automatically leads to legitimate DBNS offspring digital filters after the operations of crossover and mutation, i.e. without any recourse to gene repair. Application to the design of a bandpass FRM digital filter produces a DBNS-coefficients digital filter with superior performance to that obtained by continuous optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1693328/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for the Design and Optimization of FRM Digital Filters Over a Canonical Double-Base Multiplier Coefficient Space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for the Design and Optimization of FRM Digital Filters Over a Canonical Double-Base Multiplier Coefficient Space","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052946S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1693342,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A time-interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) consists of M parallel channel ADCs that alternately take samples from the input signal, where the sampling rate can be increased by the number of channels compared to a single channel. We recall the advantages of time interleaving and investigate the problems involved. In particular, we explain the error behavior of mismatches among the channels, which distort the output signal and reduce the system performance significantly, and provide a concise framework for dealing with them. Based on this analysis, we review the principle possibilities of calibrating TI-ADCs, where we point out the necessities and advantages of digital enhancement.

The proposed method enables a precise measurement of the offset and the gain during system operation introducing a minimum disturb at the output. The method exploits the modulation of the input signal with a random sequence of +1 and -1. The random bit-stream is generated by using the wide-band output of a time-discrete non-linear circuit. The resulting spread spectrum signal can be easily distinguished by the DC offset and the use of a digital accumulator extracts the offset and the gain of each ADC. The input signal is finally reconstructed, in the digital domain, with a synchronous demodulation. The accumulation time can be as many clock periods (like 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup>\n) thus permitting an excellent accuracy in the offset and gain measurement.

Resampling is the sequential part of the fully parallel particle filter. Therefore, parallel VLSI architectures for resampling is of particular interest. In this paper, we develop a parallel implementation of resampling. The novel feature of the proposed architecture is that the execution time of resampling becomes independent of the distributions of the weights. Despite the alternatives in the literature, our scheme achieves a very small execution time by pipelining the resampling and sampling steps. Moreover, it is scalable for high levels of parallelism, has lower memory usage, fixed routing time, and has close to ideal performance. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for a point-to-point network between processing elements and results in a simple central unit","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693361","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693361.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"3425","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient architecture for distributed resampling for high-speed particle filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"An efficient architecture for distributed resampling for high-speed particle filtering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1693361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9076223","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693361/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient architecture for distributed resampling for high-speed particle filtering","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044383S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1693367,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed measurement technique differs from previous approaches in many ways. Firstly, it avoids the use of undersampling which can become problematic at high speeds; instead, it relies on a real-time asynchronous sampling approach which eliminates the distortion jeopardy imposed by the front-end sampling network, sampling clock jitter, and delay line jitter for GHz range applications. Secondly, the information is processed in the time domain which makes use of the recent developments in time-domain amplification (Oulmane and Roberts, 2004). Thirdly, a dynamic current generation technique is used to achieve great reduction in static power dissipation and allows the front-end level-crossing detector to work at such high speeds. The circuit was implemented in a standard 0.18-mum CMOS process. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach. Preliminary experimental results are also presented.

From the floating gate potential, related to the terminal voltages, the drain current and the different charges present in the cell structure are calculated with the MM11 formulation.

Two stages of gain adjustment are adopted to adjust gain accurately and rapidly. Magnitude level of received signal is calculated over short and long period in two stages, respectively. Appropriate volumes of gain adjustment are then obtained by subtracting the estimated levels from the desired level of ADC. Next, digital volumes of gain adjustment are converted into analog control signals for variable gain amplifiers. Short stage deals with various situations as well as coarse gain adjustment. Long stage adjusts gain accurately with no more than 4 % inaccuracy of the desired level. The proposed digital AGC approach help raise SNR of received signals, enable subsequent receiver algorithms to operate efficiently with the robust signals. Additionally, the proposed approach can be easily implemented in conventional CMOS technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693388.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"3533","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage digital AGC scheme with diversity selection for frame-based OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Timing","Frequency synchronization","Robustness","CMOS technology","Electrical equipment industry","Paper technology","Performance gain","Control systems","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic gain control","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AGC","diversity selection","frame-based OFDM systems","digital automatic gain control","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","gain adjustment","digital volumes","analog control signal","receiver algorithms","CMOS technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage digital AGC scheme with diversity selection for frame-based OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693388/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9086670","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage digital AGC scheme with diversity selection for frame-based OFDM systems","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068763S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1693389,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Hao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuang-Hao Lin","id":"37291133500"},{"name":"Hsin-Lei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Lei Lin","id":"37291991300"},{"name":"Shih-Ming Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shih-Ming Wang","id":"38045308400"},{"name":"R.C.

Except for the main effect from multi-path, we should also consider some non-ideal effects from imperfect hardware design, such as the IQ imbalance from direct conversion in RF front-end. IQ imbalance is not apparent in lower-order QAM modulation. However, in higher-order QAM modulation, it will become serious interference. In this paper, an IQ imbalance compensation circuit in IEEE802.11a baseband receiver is proposed. A low complexity time-domain compensation algorithm is used to replace the traditional high-order equalizer. MATLAB is used to simulate the whole transceiver including the channel model.

This computation is rarely demonstrated in a spiking network of neurons receiving input spike trains. In this work, we demonstrate this computation not only within a VLSI network but also across networks of integrate-and-fire neurons in a feature competition task. The chip has four populations of neurons receiving input spike trains that represent the outputs of four feature maps. The connectivity within each population is configured so that all the neurons compete with one another.

Recently, block turbo codes using Reed-Solomon component codes have been introduced. This was motivated by the highest code rate property of Reed-Solomon codes and their efficiency for burst error correction. In fact, the main advantage of Reed-Solomon block turbo codes is for high code rate applications. For these applications, the code length and consequently the decoder complexity are smaller than for usual Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem block turbo codes. This paper presents a block turbo decoder architecture using Reed-Solomon component codes. Our elementary soft input soft output decoder is dedicated to Reed-Solomon codes (31, 29, 3) with single error correction power. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published architecture implementing this type of decoder.

It implies that amplitude of the natural response can directly be controlled by the forced response. For a condition that the forced response and the time-varying forced function is approximately identical, the resulted complete response of the second-order system therefore is amplitude modulation where the natural response and the time-varying forced function respectively represents sinusoidal carrier and information signals.

The proposed technique as applied to timing uncertainty mitigation in the signaling of a digital system is presented as an example; the relative phase information is used to minimize the timing skew. The proposed circuit captures the state of the signals under measurement simultaneously at random instants of time and gathers a large sample data to estimate the relative phase between the signals. By carefully premeditating the sample size, the accuracy and confidence of the result can be set to a level as high as desired. Accurately sensed value of relative phase enables the correction circuit to reduce the maximum correction error, less than half the maximum delay resolution unit available for adjustment.

The current consumption for all analog circuitries was 12muA@1.8V and together with the refresh portion less than 40muA@ 1.8V/25degC for a 32Mbit memory size to further approach towards low power SRAM substitution (Taito et al., 2003)","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693541.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"4146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.8V p(seudo)SRAM using standard 140nm DRAM technology with self adapting clocked standby operation","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"A 1.8V p(seudo)SRAM using standard 140nm DRAM technology with self adapting clocked standby operation","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9086701","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1693541/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.8V p(seudo)SRAM using standard 140nm DRAM technology with self adapting clocked standby operation","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052538S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1693553,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we investigate the thermal behavior of general applications on fine-grain reconfigurable fabrics and we introduce the pre-mapping sensor insertion problem for thermal monitoring. Our study shows that on average the maximum temperature on the chip is 19.5degC higher than the ambient temperature for a transition density of 0.5 at the primary inputs. For fine-grain reconfigurable devices targeted for general applications it is difficult to predict the locations of potential hotspots a priori. However, programmability presents a unique opportunity for effective thermal monitoring. It would allow us to perform a thermal simulation on a given design first and obtain the locations of potential points of interest in a design. Then, in the pre-mapping stage the design can be updated with insertion of thermal sensors. Given a set of expected hot spots in a design we aim to determine the minimum number of sensors and their locations in order to monitor these locations with a given sensitivity requirement. Since the thermal sensors are implemented using unused CLBs on the fabric it is essential to use the logic resources efficiently. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve the sensor placement problem addressing this optimization goal","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693601.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"4390","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-grain thermal profiling and sensor insertion for FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal sensors","Field programmable gate arrays","Temperature sensors","Reconfigurable logic","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Monitoring","CMOS logic circuits","Logic devices","Thermal stresses","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal profiling","sensor insertion","FPGA","logic densities","clock frequencies","power density","thermal monitoring","fine-grain reconfigurable devices","hotspots","thermal sensors","sensor placement problem","optimization","19.5 C"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Fine-grain thermal profiling and sensor insertion for FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693601/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9086590","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grain thermal profiling and sensor insertion for FPGAs","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076549S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1693606,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, in high-speed mobile environments, the channel may be time-variant in one OFDM symbol. This will incur the intercarrier interference (ICI) degrading seriously the performance of an OFDM system. A simple remedy is to apply the zero-forcing (ZF) equalization method. Unfortunately, the direct ZF method requires an inverse of a huge matrix requiring a prohibitively high complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity ZF method for ICI mitigation. The main idea is to explore the special structure of the ICI matrix and apply the Newton's iterative matrix inversion method. With our formulation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) can be used to reduce the complexity.

The proposed method utilizes a non-uniform sampling scheme, which adds one degree of freedom in obtaining the time constant of SC integrators. As a result, capacitor spread and total capacitor area are reduced and, hence, silicon area can be minimized. To prove the feasibility of the presented approach, the design and the implementation of a second-order lowpass notch SC filter are discussed. Experimental results from a 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS test-chip that operates at 2 kHz sampling frequency are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Capacitance","Circuits","Signal sampling","Capacitors","Signal design","Signal processing","Silicon","Filters","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched capacitor filters","low-pass filters","notch filters","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform sampling approach","capacitance spread reduction","SC circuits","time constants","silicon area","lowpass notch SC filter","CMOS test chip","2 kHz","0.35 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693726","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693726.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-uniform sampling approach for the reduction of capacitance spread in SC circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A non-uniform sampling approach for the reduction of capacitance spread in SC circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693726/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693726/","accessionNumber":"9062376","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-uniform sampling approach for the reduction of capacitance spread in SC circuits","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049079S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1693727,"authors":[{"name":"Bo-Shih Huang","affiliation":["ESD and Product Engineering Department, SoC Center, ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bo-Shih Huang","id":"37087801186"},{"name":"Ming-Dou Ker","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics and Gigascale Systems Laboratory, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Dou Ker","id":"37086975295"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9389-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"1693727","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"abstract":"A new matching design of low-noise amplifier (LNA) with ESD protection is proposed and implemented in an ESD-protected LNA, which manipulates the parasitic capacitance of ESD protection device as a core part of LNA matching network.

The current state of art CMOS analog decoders uses MOS transistors biased in weak inversion which limits their speed of operation. In this paper a novel analog decoding network is presented which can operate with MOS transistor biased both in weak and strong inversion. The principle of operation is based on margin propagation algorithm which requires only addition, subtraction and thresholding operation which can be easily implemented in analog VLSI.

Scene changes happen quite often in film broadcasting and they tend to destabilize the quality of performance such as jagged effect, blurred effect, and artifacts effect, while de-interlacing technique is utilized. Therefore, the issue of scene change needs to be addressed with de-interlacing process. In the proposed method, de-interlacing begins with scene change detection, which is to ensure that the interfield information is used correctly. To improve the quality of de-interlacing, the factors of scene change are taken into account when de-interlacing techniques are applied. Besides, based on our method, the high speed VLSI architecture has been designed and implemented.

In this paper, some weight parameter determination methods are surveyed, and a weighted prediction algorithm together with the hardware architecture design is proposed. The main idea of the algorithm is to limit the number of weight parameters transmitted by quantizing the parameter into levels and using only offset as the parameter. As a result, the extra parameters sent in each slice header is thus limited by the number of levels, and the parameter determination process requires much less computations. By further utilizing sub-sampling of brightness levels and estimated offset sum, a simplified architecture is also proposed.

The correlation between the signal bandwidth and the switching frequency, in turn related to switching losses, imposes practical limits for high bandwidth applications. Stringent specifications appear in such applications as audio amplifiers (kHz signal bandwidths), and lately, in fast envelope tracking power amplifiers (MHz signal bandwidths) for the Envelope Elimination and Restoration technique in polar RF power amplification. Bandwidth limitations in PWM amplifiers are explored in this work by proposing design criteria for obtaining the switching frequency to signal bandwidth ratio (f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n/f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n) so as to guarantee a given aliasing error. To achieve that purpose, PWM spectra are reviewed for single tone, two-tone and multitone signals. Subsequently, by taking into account the analogy between PWM and FM spectra, bandwidths around the switching frequency are estimated by extending Carson's rule to an arbitrary error. This allows obtaining an extension of the Nyquist criterion for pulse-width modulation. System-level simulation results are reported to validate the analysis, showing that the conventional f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n/f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</sub>\n factor used in the power converter design field might be too conservative","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Bandwidth","Switching frequency","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power amplifiers","RF signals","Pulse width modulation converters","Switching converters","Switching loss","Signal restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","power amplifiers","pulse width modulation","PWM power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM switching amplifier","PWM buck switching power converter","switching frequency","switching loss","audio amplifiers","fast envelope tracking power amplifiers","Envelope Elimination and Restoration technique","polar RF power amplification","signal bandwidth ratio","aliasing error","Nyquist criterion","pulse-width modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693835","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693835.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","endPage":"5326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth limits in PWM switching amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1693835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth limits in PWM switching amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693835/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1693835/","accessionNumber":"9086408","conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth limits in PWM switching amplifiers","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693835.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039185S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1693840,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chi Cheng","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Chi Cheng","id":"37290804100"},{"name":"Ching-Yeh Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yeh Chen","id":"37280738200"},{"name":"Yi-Hau Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Hau Chen","id":"37423650200"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["DSP/IC Design Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Liang-Gee Chen","id":"37280381000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9389-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"1693840","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Motion analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms","Hardware","Filtering","Video coding","Filters","Yarn","Digital signal processing","Design engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","motion compensation","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","motion-compensated temporal filtering","scalable video coding","MCTF process","prediction step","update step","hardware architecture","VLSI implementation","off-chip memory access","on-chip memory access","inverse motion vectors"]}],"abstract":"Motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) is the core technology of the next generation scalable video coding schemes.

For the sake of increased bandwidth efficiency, they require an equalizer which mitigates the distortion of the frequency selective transmission channel.

To increase the accuracy of the side information, a modified three dimensional recursive search block matching is proposed. The resulting motion vectors preserve the true motion of objects because of the spatial and temporal consistency. The results obtained show a significant improvement over full search block matching algorithm in the term of the rate-distortion measure.

An appropriate design based on well-defined system parameters and architecture can make a huge difference in the performance, cost and marketability of the entire system. In particular, there is a need for improved digital automatic gain control (AGC) for use in multi input multi output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems with application to wireless local area networks (WLANs), targeted for the upcoming 802.11n standard based in H. Yu et al. (2004) and H. Yu et al. (2005). In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm and implementation of the digital AGC for next generation WLANs. The proposed AGC algorithm has two feedback loops for gain control to improve convergence speed, and at the same time maintains the stability of the AGC circuit.

The tongue is considered an excellent appendage in severely disabled people for operating an assistive device. Tongue Drive consists of an array of Hall-effect magnetic sensors mounted on a dental retainer on the outer side of the teeth to measure the magnetic field generated by a small permanent magnet secured on the tongue. The sensor signals are transmitted across a wireless link and processed to control the movements of a cursor on a computer screen or to operate a powered wheelchair, a phone, or other equipments. The principal advantage of this technology is the possibility of capturing a large variety of tongue movements by processing a combination of sensor outputs. This would provide the user with a smooth proportional control as opposed to a switch based on/off control that is the basis of most existing technologies. We modeled the effects of position and orientation of the permanent magnet on the sensors in FEMLAB and experimentally measured them.

This paper proposes a computer-aided-diagnosis of tonsillitis using tonsil size and color. In this method, we employ red color and tonsil size as features. In order to detect the abnormal features, the proposed idea considers a trend of changing the features in each day. The change of tonsillitis features in each day would be computed in order to input into a decision model.

With image segmentation, we can detect all objects in the image no matter whether they are moving or not. Using image segmentation results of successive frames, we exploit object matching in a simple object feature space for tracking of objects. For both real-time processing and compact implementation, we developed a novel image-scan based region-growing segmentation architecture, which efficiently utilizes high access-bandwidth embedded memories. The structure of image-scan processing element array is at the same time exploited for object feature extraction. Using simple object features, object matching can be realized for finding the most similar object in the previous image frame.

Structured arrays have many inherent benefits in terms of CAD tool design, testability and reliable fabrication. FPGAs and structured ASIC fabrics are two examples, but their speed, area and power overheads are high due to their programmability features. If programmability is removed, it is possible to reduce the overhead. Perhaps it is time to revisit the use of structured logic for fixed-function blocks, such as ROMs and PLAs, to determine if they are better-suited for this purpose. In particular, this paper investigates the PLA from the self-test and self-repair perspectives. ASIC blocks are known to have limitations in terms of self-test, but have little or no hope of providing self-repair. In contrast, this paper proposes straight-forward solutions for self-test and self-repair of PLAs. We find that it can provide 100% self-test coverage, and a very high probability of self-repair at the cost of area overhead","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693910","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/11145/35661/01693910.pdf","startPage":"4 pp.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1693910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 May 2006","displayDocTitle":"Testable and self-repairable structured logic design","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9055495","htmlLink":"/document/1693910/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testable and self-repairable structured logic design","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"01693910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045504S","chronDate":"21-24 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11145","isNumber":"35661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11145","xplore-issue":"35661","articleId":"1693910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1693917,"authors":[{"name":"Zih-Yin Ding","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Zih-Yin Ding","id":"38043439800"},{"name":"Chi-Yun Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Yun Chen","id":"37539306500"},{"name":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tzi-Dar Chiueh","id":"37273337000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9389-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"1693917","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"abstract":"In this paper, based on the IEEE 802.11n proposal, a MIMO-OFDM baseband receiver design for next-generation WLAN is proposed.

This fact is also correlated with the measurements of crest factor made on the noise output of band-pass amplifiers by various investigators. It is shown that the distribution of noise amplitude continues to follow the normal-error law, even after the noise has been passed through frequency-selective circuits. It is shown why the measurements of crest factor, made by various experimenters, group around the value 4, but it is pointed out that this is not a true crest factor because the voltage occasionally goes considerably higher. The ratio of the average to the effective voltage is shown to be 0.798.

In a brief historical sketch of the antenna problem the factors which must be taken into consideration in solving the problem are discussed. While in ordinary transmission lines the voltage is proportional to the charge, this is not the case in antennas. The explanation lies in the fact that antennas are multiple transmission lines (like wave guides) and not simple, that is, single-mode transmission lines. Our present theory is based on the voltage-current equations since these appear to be considerably simpler than charge-current equations. The latter are considered only briefly. In the absence of dissipation and in so far as the total voltage wave and the \"principal\" current wave are concerned, radiation is strictly an end effect. In so far as the total current and the total charge waves are concerned, radiation effects are distributed (nonuniformly) along the entire antenna. In the first approximation, regardless of the shape of the wire the charge is proportional to the voltage and waves are sinusoidal, the current wave having nodes while the voltage wave and the charge wave antinodes at the ends of the antenna.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1941.231669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35675","startPage":"493","endPage":"521","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35675/01694334.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1941.231669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of Antennas of Arbitrary Size and Shape","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna theory","Shape","Voltage","Transmitting antennas","Transmission line theory","Transmission line antennas","Equations","Impedance","Radiation effects","Wire"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1941","displayDocTitle":"Theory of Antennas of Arbitrary Size and Shape","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1694334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept. 1941","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of Antennas of Arbitrary Size and Shape","sourcePdf":"01694334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023593S","chronDate":"Sept. 1941","isNumber":"35675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"106","articleId":"1694334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1941","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1694454,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.L.

Another useful parameter is the \"surface resistivity\" determined by the skin effect, which has simply the dimension of resistance.

During the past several years considerable experience has been gained with respect to this problem under various receiving conditions. The system of synchronization which has given satisfactory results up to the present time has depended for its operation on the reception and separation of individual pulses. In general, it can be said that with this system satisfactory synchronization can be obtained from those signals which will in all other respects provide an entirely acceptable picture. However, for limiting conditions of service, particularly during early operation where field strength may be low, an improvement in synchronization will be effective and desirable provided that it does not involve other complications or disadvantages. This paper describes a synchronizing means at the receiver that employs a new principle in the field of synchronization. The principle is automatic frequency and phase control of the saw-tooth scanning voltages. In such a system, synchronization depends on the average of many regularly recurring synchronizing pulses. Noise has insufficient energy at the scanning frequencies to effect control through the direct-current link from which all but relatively long-time variations are filtered out. Experimental receivers, in which automatic phase and frequency control of the scanning oscillators has been incorporated, have operated with high immunity to noise. The degree of immunity is of a different order of magnitude from that found in conventional synchronizing systems. Noise cannot affect horizontal resolution or interlacing.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1943.232382","startPage":"7","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35688/01694566.pdf","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1943.232382","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1943","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1943","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1694566/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Frequency and Phase Control of Synchronization in Television Receivers","volume":"31","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1943","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Frequency and Phase Control of Synchronization in Television Receivers","sourcePdf":"01694566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052181S","chronDate":"Jan. 1943","isNumber":"35688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1694566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1943","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1694633,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The case of coaxial circular filaments has been quite thoroughly treated and any desired accuracy is attainable. However, the available formulas for more general cases such as circles with parallel or inclined axes are slowly convergent for considerable ranges of the parameters and for such cases admit of only rough accuracy. The present paper is concerned with providing formulas and tables capable of giving a moderate accuracy, with a moderate amount of labor, even in complicated cases. The tables apply to calculations for equal circles with parallel axes, and to circles of nearly equal radii having inclined axes which intersect at the center of one of the circles. This latter case enters in the design of a variometer composed of two coils of small cross sections; the former is applicable to the calculation of a variometer with coils having eccentric axes. A general formula is derived, which allows of a fairly simple method of computation for any desired case, by the employment of a chart of the flux distribution about a circular filament carrying current. An accuracy of a few parts in a thousand is readily attainable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1694856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct. 1944","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1944","volume":"32","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 1944","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Calculation of the Mutual Inductance of Circular Filaments in Any Desired Positions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Calculation of the Mutual Inductance of Circular Filaments in Any Desired Positions","sourcePdf":"01694856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047577S","chronDate":"Oct. 1944","isNumber":"35701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1694856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1944","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1694878,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Both transient and sinusoidal field phenomena may now be studied by the network analyzer or by numerical and analytical circuit methods. Examples are radiation from antennas, propagation through wave guides and cavity resonators of arbitrary shapes, eddy currents in conductors, stresses in current-carrying structures, and other general problems in which moving charges either do not enter, or if they do, they may be replaced by equivalent dielectric constants, as in small signal waves on stationary or moving space charge. The circuits are developed for all curvilinear orthogonal reference frames to allow the solution, to any desired degree of accuracy, of special three-dimensional problems with axial and other symmetry by the use of only a two-dimensional network. The electromagnetic field may be nonhomogeneous, nonisotropic (of a special form), and may be divided into blocks of uneven length in different directions. The transient character of the circuit allows the variation of the frequency of the impressed quantities on the alternating-current network analyzer without varying the magnitude of the circuit impedances. One set of two-dimensional networks, the transmission-line type, requires only resistances, inductances, and capacitors, while its dual set requires also ideal transformers in series with the inductive coils. (In the transmission-line type of networks the dual ideal transformers consist of impedanceless conductors.) The three-dimensional network, being its own dual, requires both ideal transformers and impedanceless conductors.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35707","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35707/01694985.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1944.231021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1944.231021","startPage":"289","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent Circuit of the Field Equations of Maxwell-I","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1944","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1944","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1694985/","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent Circuit of the Field Equations of Maxwell-I","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"May 1944","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent Circuit of the Field Equations of Maxwell-I","sourcePdf":"01694985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048697S","chronDate":"May 1944","isNumber":"35707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"100","articleId":"1694985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1944","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":1695024,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

We propose a technique to alleviate the complexity of the equivalence checking problem, by efficiently decomposing it using compare points. Traditionally, equivalence checking techniques use nominal or functional mapping of latches as compare points. Since we operate at a level where design descriptions are in system level languages or hardware description languages, we leverage the information available to us at this level in deducing sequential compare points. Sequential compare points encapsulate the sequential behavior of designs and are obtained by statically analyzing the design descriptions. We decompose the design using sequential compare points and represent the design behavior at these compare points by symbolic expressions. We use a SAT solver to check the equivalence of the symbolic expressions. In order to demonstrate our technique, we present results on a non-trivial case study.

We also integrate this process compatibly with planar devices on the same die using minimal additional mask steps. Various implant conditions, order of implant step, and starting substrate dopings are studied and best conditions identified through TSUPREM4 simulations and later through experiments to ensure process robustness and dopant tunability for the vertical devices as well as to ensure comparable performance for planar and vertical devices. In anticipation of usage of this process in a high-density environment, the impact of isolation density on the leakage characteristics of vertical capacitors is also studied. After simultaneously fabricating planar and vertical structures, electrical characterization using capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) measurements is performed. Functional capacitors for both types of devices are obtained. Oxide thickness is backtracked using I-V, C-V, and TEM and yield consistent results. The leakage current shows expected trends with voltage and is successfully fitted using prevalent tunneling models. The vertical structures are found to suffer from two problems: a larger leakage current and an additional planar parasitic capacitance due to a finite polysilicon gate thickness. The larger leakage is attributed to thin corners as confirmed by higher leakage in structures having a larger fraction of corner area (higher isolation density structures). A modified novel vertical device process circumventing both these problems by yielding thicker bottom and corner oxides is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Finally, a path to extending this process for vertical transistor fabrication is shown in simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1695955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2006","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9118735","htmlLink":"/document/1695955/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Spacer Process for Sub-10-nm-Thick Vertical MOS and Its Integration With Planar MOS Device","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Spacer Process for Sub-10-nm-Thick Vertical MOS and Its Integration With Planar MOS Device","sourcePdf":"01695955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043332S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"35735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"35735","articleId":"1695955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1695965,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Traditionally, these needs have been satisfied by the increase in transistor density and performance, as suggested by 'Moore's Law\" and guided by CMOS scaling theory. As the silicon industry moves towards the 45nm node and beyond, the two most important challenges cited are the growing standby power dissipation and the increasing variability in device characteristics. These complaints are cited as the reason Moore's Law is \"broken\", or why CMOS scaling is coming to an end. Actually, these effects are the embodiments of CMOS technology's approach to atomistic and quantum-mechanical physics boundaries.

Critical parameters such as silicon area, power, testability, and off-chip interconnect quality must be properly balanced to maximize the I/O performance versus cost ratio. For example, there is a fundamental tradeoff between clock quality and equalizer effectiveness [1]. Producing precision RX and TX clocks and a sensitive RX may impact the power and area of some circuits, but it could allow the use of simple, low-power linear equalizers to minimize the overall link power. Additionally, these equalizers will become much more effective by limiting near-end crosstalk and stubbed backplane (BP) via length. To demonstrate this system-level optimization effort, we have developed a 20Gb/s forwarded clock I/O system intended for a wide parallel link with small area and low power.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01696056.png","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/11149/35738/01696056.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2006.1696056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2006.1696056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1696056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20Gb/s Forwarded Clock Transceiver in 90nm CMOS B.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Transceivers","Equalizers","Jitter","Delay","Integrated circuit interconnections","Phase locked loops","Table lookup","Microprocessors","Cost function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1696056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Feb. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A 20Gb/s Forwarded Clock Transceiver in 90nm CMOS B.","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1696056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"6-9 Feb. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20Gb/s Forwarded Clock Transceiver in 90nm CMOS B.","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01696056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048136S","chronDate":"6-9 Feb. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11149","isNumber":"35738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11149","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"35738","articleId":"1696056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1696060,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

This decoding rule minimizes the probability of symbol error over a time-discrete memory less channel by employing the dual code. It is shown that these algorithms meet all requirements needed for iterative decoding as the output of the decoder can be split into three independent estimates: soft channel value, a priori term and extrinsic value. It represents a better form of coding for the q-ary LDPC codes, which have been shown to outperform binary LDPC codes and Reed-Solomon codes on the AWGN channel and it gives us a new fast and reduced-complexity decoding algorithm. The complexity of this rule varies inversely with code rate, making the technique particularly attractive for high rate codes. Finally, we see that complexity is reduced by using the dual code, and the algorithm is accelerated by using the fast Hadamard transform (FHT).

The base station employs single-carrier space-time bit-interleaved coded modulations with linear preceding for each user. From an information-theoretic point of view, this scheme is potentially capacity achieving but puts high stakes on the receiver complexity. Channel estimation is made particularly difficult by the superimposition of pilot symbols and data. Indeed, the classical channel estimation method based on matched filtering and accumulation clearly fails to give satisfactory performance in a spatial multiplexing and overloading context. Thus, we propose a sophisticated iterative receiver which includes channel estimation, MMSE-based chip-equalization and MMSE-based multiuser detection together with decoding of the turbo-code. Simultaneous downlink transmission to several users is investigated in this paper which brings out the overloading flexibility in terms of space-time modulation and coding scheme (ST-MCS) design and radio resource allocation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Receiver Architecture for MIMO HSDPA Evolution","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","doi":"10.1109/WIMOB.2006.1696369","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11150/35739/01696369.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIMOB.2006.1696369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1696369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1696369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Receiver Architecture for MIMO HSDPA Evolution","conferenceDate":"19-21 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1696369/","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9132999","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Receiver Architecture for MIMO HSDPA Evolution","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01696369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057527S","chronDate":"19-21 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11150","isNumber":"35739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11150","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"35739","articleId":"1696369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1696377,"authors":[{"name":"A.O.

To mitigate these interferences and hence increase the capacity and allow high data rates, multiuser detection (MUD) techniques are used. The main drawback of such receivers is the increase in complexity when compared to the conventional receiver based on the Rake receiver. The multistage parallel interference cancellation (MPIC) receiver is considered a serious candidate for practical implementation showing a good tradeoff between performance and complexity. However, in order to satisfy the performances of the third generation systems, it is important to use MPIC with decision feedback (DF). In the other hand, the parallel implementation of the DF-MPIC has been proven to be strongly compromised. In order to improve the implementation aspects with minimum effect on the algorithm performances, a new block DF-MPIC scheme is proposed in this paper.

The LDPC codewords are mapped onto space-time modulation blocks, referred to as associated space-time (AST) codewords, in one-to-one correspondence. Based on this relationship, the distance spectrum of the AST code is identified in a combinatorial manner, and each AST codeword possessing the same distance metric renders the identical pairwise error probability. The union bound is obtained in a closed form and can be efficiently evaluated by the method of polynomial expansion. In addition, the analysis is extended to the system with random coding which contributes to a concise expression of the error exponent. Numerical results are presented for different channel scenarios and modulation schemes, which indicate that the bounds are useful to benchmark the practical performance of iterative detection and decoding algorithms","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

In this paper we propose a novel power control scheme called modified spatial-temporal truncated channel inversion (MST-TCI) for limited feedback MIMO systems in block Rayleigh fading channels. A low-complexity algorithm called codebook optimum index loading (COIL) is proposed to generate near-optimum codebooks for quantizing MST-TCI power control information.

Uplink sounding is intended for TDD systems and works by the base translating the uplink channel estimates into downlink channel estimates. DCFB is a means of obtaining full channel knowledge in either FDD or TDD systems. In DCFB, the mobile replaces normal transmitted symbols with a DCFB waveform constructed from downlink channel estimates to multiple base antennas. Another feedback method for TDD or FDD is codebook feedback where the mobile chooses a best transmit weight out of a codebook of 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sup>\n vectors and then signals this weight back to the base. To track the frequency-selective channel, multiple codebook vectors are sent back corresponding to different parts of the band. Simulation results show that uplink sounding is the best method for obtaining channel information for transmit beamforming, but sounding is only effective in TDD systems. For FDD, DCFB is more flexible, computationally efficient (at the mobile), and effective than codebook feedback for broadband transmit beamforming at the base","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

We show that for narrow-band i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) MIMO channels, SS has the lowest ergodic capacity, while GSTBC, QSTBC and LDC have almost the same ergodic capacity. We then compare their input-output mutual information when fixed-order modulation is deployed and show that the same performance order maintains. Finally we look into their bit error rate (BER) performance for uncoded systems, and show that LDC slightly outperforms GSTBC and QSTBC in high SNR regions and below BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n, and SS has the worst performance.

The knowledge about the time dispersion of a channel can be used for designing better systems which can adapt themselves to the changing nature of the transmission medium. In this paper, algorithms for estimating the time dispersion (frequency selectivity) of the channel, which use the frequency domain channel estimates or the frequency domain received signal, are proposed. The proposed algorithms first estimate the power delay profile (PDP) from which the two important dispersion parameters, namely root-mean-squared (RMS) delay spread and maximum excess delay of the channel, are estimated. It is shown that synchronization errors bias the performance of the estimators based on the channel correlation, and this bias is removed by obtaining the PDP using the magnitude of the channel estimates. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated using computer simulations","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

System coverage results are presented for a 1xEV-DO broadcast network based on a comprehensive evaluation methodology developed in 3GPP2 for system modeling and orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM). The results show that distributed transmit diversity can deliver significant coverage gains. For example, given a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, a data rate of 1.2 Mbps and a minimum bit-error rate (BER) requirement of 0.1%, the broadcast coverage increases from roughly 40% in the absence of distributed TD to 70% with the Alamouti linear combiner and to 82% with a zero-forcing (ZF) spatial equalizer","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

One critical issue for such systems is channel estimation. In this paper, we first develop a pilot-embedded data-bearing (PEDB) approach for joint channel estimation and data detection. Then we propose a least square (LS) FFT-based channel estimator by employing the concept of FFT-based channel estimation to improve the performance of the PEDB-LS channel estimation. Also, the effects of model mismatch error when considering non-integer multipath delay profiles, and its performance are investigated. We further propose an adaptive LS FFT-based channel estimator that employs the optimum number of significant taps. Simulation results reveal that the adaptive LS FFT-based estimator provides superior performance under quasi-static channels or low Doppler's shift regimes","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Obviously, the traditional least-square solution for the ICI matrix estimation based on the pseudo-inverse operation has its limitation. In addition, the provision of a sufficiently long training sequence to estimate the complete ICI matrix is not feasible, since it will result in severe throughput reduction. In this paper, we design padded maximum-length shift-register sequences (pm-sequences) to serve as the training sequences for the ICI estimation. Such new training sequences will induce the diagonal correlation matrices which can lead to the optimal estimation. We propose a new distributive allocation scheme of short pm-sequences for the ICI estimation with a linear ICI estimate interpolation, which can lead to the multi-ICI-vector estimation to combat the realistic non-circulant ICI matrix problem, where almost all other existing schemes such as the ICI matrix estimation using the Hadamard sequences, the convolutional coder/decoder and the ICI self-cancellation coder/decoder could not perform effectively","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

The individual users' signals are differentiated with the aid of their unique user-specific channel impulse responses (CIRs). The MUD commences its operation on a subcarrier by subcarrier basis from the minimum mean square error (MMSE) MUD antenna array weight vector and invokes the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm for the sake of iteratively adjusting the array weight vector in the direction of the MUD's true minimum bit error rate (MBER) solution. Recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes are used for enhancing the system's attainable BER performance, which exchange extrinsic information with the MBER MUD for the sake of achieving a turbo-detection aided iteration gain, resulting in the creation of a powerful turbo MBER MUD for employment in multiuser SDMA OFDM systems. The novel benefit of the proposed system is that it is capable of supporting up to a factor two higher number of users than the number of receiver antennas. Explicitly, the technique advocated outperforms other SDMA MUDs with the advent of its MBER optimization criterion and turbo detection structure.

Internal fragmentation occurs when the allocated data rate is larger than what is requested while external fragmentation occurs when the OVSF code tree is too fragmented to support a call even if there are sufficient capacity remaining in the code tree. The key factor in solving these two problems is the OVSF code assignment strategy. Most works in the literature do not consider the time-varying and location-dependent channel conditions. In this paper, we formulate the fragmentation problem as a multiple knapsack problem where each OVSF code is considered as a knapsack. We propose single-code, time-shared strategies that consider channel conditions while solving these fragmentation problems. We show that internal fragmentation can be significantly reduced if we can properly select users to share OVSF codes.

New codes designed with imperfect CSI are obtained using an iterative algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results show that in the presence of channel estimation errors, the codes designed based on our criterion assuming imperfect CSI have improved bit error probability performance compared with existing codes that were designed under the perfect CSI assumption.

Our principle finding is that power allocation using SVD and waterfilling at the source and the relay cannot achieve maximum capacity in cooperative MIMO networks. We find the optimal power allocation at the relay for the two antenna case when waterfilling is used for the direct path. A modified waterfilling power allocation method at the relay is used to increase the overall cooperative capacity when the relay is close to the source. The proposed power allocation method achieves high capacity gain in cooperative MIMO networks using a simple method when the relay has no channel information concerning the direct path. As the distance between the source and the relay increases, the outage probability at the relay plays an important role in cooperative networks. To improve the outage probability at the relay, we use a waterfilling method for the channel between the source and the relay.

Scheduling of power and rate among competing data streams is a key component to any such resource allocation strategy. We believe a scheduler should be both efficient and fair. We propose here a scheduler that takes advantage of variations in the wireless channel both channel fluctuations in time for each user, and channel variations among multiple users at a particular time. By mixing a max-min policy with a policy of serving users with relatively good channels, the scheduler can achieve individual average throughput targets in a manner that encourages system efficiency. We analyze the proposed scheduler using numerical examples, which demonstrate the superiority in both efficiency and fairness over proportional fair scheduling.

It is assumed that the channel undergoes Doppler frequency shift and an AR1channel model is adopted to track the channel temporal correlation coefficients at the transmitter. Using the combination of transmit beamforming and quasi-orthogonal block coding over adjacent channel blocks, we accomplish to achieve the available array gains on top of notable diversity gains and coding gains, compared to the standard solutions in the conventional wireless communication schemes.

The standard minimum mean square error (MMSE) design is based on the principle of minimising the mean square error (MSE) between the beamformer's desired output and complex-valued beamformer output. Since the desired output for BPSK systems is real-valued, minimising the MSE between the beamformer's desired output and real-part of the beamformer output can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance, and we refer to this alternative MMSE design as the real-valued MMSE (RV-MMSE) to contrast to the standard complex-valued MMSE (CV-MMSE). The minimum BER (MBER) design however still outperforms the RV-MMSE solution, particularly for overloaded systems where degree of freedom of the antenna array is smaller than the number of BPSK users. Adaptive implementation of this RV-MMSE design is realised using a least mean square (LMS) type adaptive algorithm, which we refer to as the RV-LMS, in comparison to the standard CV-LMS algorithm.

Viswanath et al., 2002). The basic idea is to artificially create large channel fluctuations among different users by transmitting random weighted signal copies from multiple transmit antennas. These fluctuations can then be exploited by a smart user scheduler to enhance the performance in system level perspective. However, for wide-band systems, these weighted transmitted signals can not form a single beam pointing to certain direction due to multipath propagation. In this case, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is suggested to slice the whole bandwidth into many narrow band flat fading sub-carriers so that random beamforming concept can be applied on each of them. Conventional wide-band random beamforming needs to generate a large number of random transmit vectors which is equal to number of sub-carriers. This induces high computational complexity and make the problem of optimizing probability density function (pdf) of the these random vectors hard to be followed. Moreover, it also needs as many number of IFFT operation as number transmit antennas. This paper presents a novel structure for random beamforming of wide-band systems by using cyclic delay operation where only two random vectors and one IFFT operation are needed. Compared with traditional method, our proposal can significantly reduce the system complexity. Furthermore, the simulation results show that our proposal points out a direction for how to optimize the pdf of random vectors","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

The benefit of multiuser diversity is obtained using the proportional fair scheduling algorithm in combination with multiple transmit antennas. The antenna gains (power and phase) are randomly varied to induce fast fluctuation in slow fading channels. In this paper, we present an enhancement of this technique, named time coherent-opportunist beamforming, which exploits the time coherence existing in the slow fading channels to yield improved throughput. The proposed scheme is compared to opportunistic beamforming. Computer simulation results indicate a favorable throughput performance. Analysis in terms of scheduling jitter and frame size is also carried out. The average throughput of the proposed scheme approaches the average throughput of the optimal beamforming independently of the number of users. For a fixed number of users, the proposed scheme converges to the optimal beamforming as either the frame size or the scheduling jitter goes to infinity.

Due to its spectral efficiency and robustness over multipath channels, OFDM has been adopted for broadband communications. However, for high-speed mobility, the time-varying channels pose a performance limitation to the wireless OFDM systems. In this paper, we investigate the OFDM system performance in the time-varying channels where the intercarrier interference (ICI) occurs; we study the impacts of the time-varying multipath fadings together with the multiple Doppler spreads. According to our analysis and simulation results, the maximum OFDM symbol normalized Doppler frequency must be less than 0.04 to achieve the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) = 20 dB or larger. As the maximum OFDM symbol normalized Doppler frequency increases, the OFDM system performance degrades dramatically.

Previous work on DCCs has focused on special full-rank cases where code parameters were fixed. In this paper, we relax DCC parameter selection and design DCC codes with improved design flexibility such that any desired number of channel modes can be excited by the precoder. Unlike previous full-rank DCCs, we prove that our new DCCs are rank-deficient. Through theory and numerical simulation, we quantify the system's resulting loss in capacity.

However, conventional differential modulation (CDM) leads to a 3 dB loss over coherent modulation. To overcome this with minimal complexity, iterative decoding employing hard decision feedback and bit-interleaved coded modulation have been suggested. The channel encoder often employs convolutional codes which may require low rates or high constraint length to reduce the flooring effect in CDM. In this paper we propose residual arithmetic codes for channel coding. We show through simulated results that the arithmetic codes can achieve similar or better bit error rate (BER) performance than convolutional codes of the same rate and asymptotic coding gain at t = 1, 2 error correcting capability with minimal complexity.

The Bhattacharya upper bound is derived for impulsive noise and is found to closely match with the simulation results.

Further, the use of incorrect impulse noise model in the receiver decoding algorithm is found to cause severe penalty in fading channels. Our results also show that MDPC codes outperform traditional convolutional codes in impulsive noise channels. The performance of MDPC codes is found to be slightly inferior to turbo codes, when the latter uses slightly lower code rate and higher complexity.

These techniques are particularly appropriate for applications in which there are spatial or temporal disparities in received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this paper, we consider the application of superposition coding to improve the throughput of the forward link in a CDMA cellular system using orthogonal spreading sequences. By taking advantage of power disparities that are created by power control on the forward link, the system can transmit to a larger number of users by transmitting to multiple users on a single spreading sequence and using superposition coding. We use an abstraction of a cellular communication system in which Shannon capacity or the optimal capacity equations for broadcasting on an additive white Gaussian noise channel are used to determine the required transmit power to a user or users. We evaluate the user capacity achieved with the proposed superposition coding technique under both average-and fixed-power constraints. We compare the performance of the proposed technique to that of a system that employs generalized Welch bound equality (GWBE) sequences. The results indicate that superposition coding can significantly increase the user capacity of a cellular system and that broadcasting is much more effective than using GWBE sequences","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Space division multiple access OFDM may be an appropriate solution to design spectrally efficient and high data-rate communication systems. Moreover, communication systems using transmitter diversity can provide additional spatial diversity gains. However, increasing the number of transmitting antennas may induce another source of co-channel interference in asynchronous multi-user channels. In order to observe the performance of various transmitter diversity techniques under the asynchronous mode of transmission, first, we develop space-time minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers for both space-time block coded OFDM and beamforming based MIMO OFDM. The average signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) resulting from MMSE combining indicates that the bit-error rate (BER) performance of space-time block coded (STBC) multi-user OFDM is highly dependent on the amount of timing offset. Overall, simulation results demonstrate that closed-loop MIMO systems need to be employed to obtain substantial diversity gains in asynchronous multi-user OFDM channels with random timing offset","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

As a consequence, several PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature each offering a different combination of system performance, complexity and bandwidth efficiency. One of the most promising of these is the selective mapping (SLM) technique which has been shown to offer PAPR reductions of several dBs. However, the fact that the SLM technique requires invoking the IFFT process several times per transmitted OFDM-block increases the system complexity and hence results in long latencies and high power consumption. Inspired by the SLM approach, we propose a novel post-IFFT PAPR reduction technique combined with a suitable selection strategy for determining a unique set of time-domain sequences per OFDM block that can minimise the PAPR. It will be shown that PAPR reductions within 0.7 dB of the ordinary SLM performance can be achieved with our proposed technique which requires several order of magnitude less complexity than that of the SLM technique","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

WCNC 2006.","abstract":"It is well-known that using multiple antennas provides a substantial capacity and diversity increase for wireless communication systems. A multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique that utilizes the channel knowledge both at the transmitter and the receiver is known as beamforming. Beamforming separates a MIMO channel into parallel subchannels. It was previously shown that uncoded beamforming achieves a diversity order of (N - S + 1)(M - S + 1) if S symbols are transmitted simultaneously for N transmit and M receive antennas. Hence, there is a significant drop in the diversity order (and performance) of the system with increased spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we introduce bit interleaved coded multiple beamforming and name the system BICMB. We provide interleaver design criteria such that the resulting system achieves full spatial multiplexing of min(N, M) and full spatial diversity of NM. Simulation results show that BICMB, due to its ability of maintaining the maximum diversity order even at full spatial multiplexing, provides substantial performance gain when compared to the best spatial multiplexing systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=34937","startPage":"2046","endPage":"2050","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Much of the previous studies in this area, however, assumed perfect synchronization among cooperating nodes and identically distributed communication links.

This paper develops an analytical framework for computing an upper bound on the average bit error rate of a distributed space-time coded system with inter-symbol interference (due to imperfect location predictions and clock jitters between cooperating nodes and choice of data pulse shaping filters) over generalized fast fading channels. As an illustrative example, the performance of 2x1 multiple-input-single-output system that uses distributed orthogonal space-time block coding is presented, although this approach can be readily extended to analyze distributed transmit maximal ratio diversity and other variants of space-time schemes","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

In this paper, impact of filtering on companded OFDM signal is studied. BER performances of different companding schemes are compared for both AWGN and fading channel and error mechanisms are outlined. It is shown that filtering has a significant impact on the performance of the system and must be taken into account before a design choice is made.

In this paper we focus on packet-oriented systems and we propose to combine adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) at physical layer and hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) at the data link layer. In the proposed multilevel hybrid ARQ (M-HARQ) strategy, the transmitted symbols are decomposed into a set of parallel sub-channels with an independent ARQ protocol over each sub-stream. It follows a layered structure where each sub-channel can be decoded only once the lower sub-channels have been resolved, thus subchannels are sequentially detected. The number of parallel streams is adaptively arranged according to the channel state information (CSI). Considerable throughput gain is achieved using the same encoder/decoder structure for all the sub-channels. Moreover, M-HARQ permits an adaptive and flexible implementation even when CSI is not available.

Very often, multipath fading channels result in the severe AMC performance degradation or induce large classification errors. The negative impacts of multipath fading channels on AMC have been discussed in the existing literature but no solution has ever been proposed so far to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new robust AMC algorithm, which applies higher-order statistics (HOS) in a generic framework for blind channel estimation and pattern recognition. The advantage of our new algorithm is that, by carefully designing the essential features needed for AMC, we don't really have to acquire the complete channel information and therefore it can be feasible without any a priori information in practice. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that our new AMC algorithm can achieve the much better classification accuracy than the existing AMC techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

It is also important in practical systems for improving the accuracy of the link adaptation and the efficiency of radio-resource-management. Conventional linear average SNR characterization of fading channel performance lacks generality, since the same linear SNR value may lead to drastic block error rate differences in various fading channels. A unified metric is proposed in this paper for link performance characterization and quality modeling. This paper proposes a mutual-information-based (Mi-based) link quality model, which contains separate modulation and coding models. The modulation model maps the received SNR to the mutual information symbol by symbol. The coding model maps the sum or average of the mutual information to decoding performance for each coding block. The existing methods based on the effective signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of a multi-state channel have limited accuracy in the mixed modulation cases. Compared with the existing models, the Mi-model is simpler and easier to apply to mixed-modulation cases and different H-ARQ schemes. The simulation results verify the accuracy in different multi-state channels and give the comparison with the exponential effective-SNR-mapping (EESM) model","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fading-insensitive performance metric for a unified link quality model","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Hot-carriers (HCs), found in the CMOS synchronization devices, are high-energy charge-carriers that can degrade the MOSFET's performance by damaging the internal structure and lead to an increase in the phase noise therein. The increase in the phase noise can be related to a critical parameter, the MOSFET threshold voltage. The HC effect is particularly evident in the short-channel MOSFET devices. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the phase noise arising from the HC effect on the single-carrier QAM systems in terms of the symbol-error-rate (SER) and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We provide an exact analysis for the SER and SINR degradation for the QPSK systems in the presence of the phase noise, and verify our analytical results through computer simulations. In addition, we illustrate the performance degradation of the single-carrier 16-QAM and 64-QAM systems via Monte Carlo simulations. Through our analysis and simulations, we can show that the SER performance of the QPSK systems can deteriorate by two orders-of-magnitude at an SNR of 10 dB.

Due to the high speed of the UAVs, the nature of the environments where they are usually deployed and the possible intentional jamming that might exist, the effect of phenomena such as multipath propagation and Doppler spread is more pronounced. In this paper, we propose an adaptive channel assignment (ACA) strategy for allocating the available bandwidth, which is divided into a number of sub-channels, over a number of communications links in a network of UAVs. The proposed ACA algorithm has two main advantages over the static channel assignment (SCA) approach. First, it maximizes the overall throughput of the UAVs network and second, it significantly reduces the probability of outage in the system defined as the percentage of time the links are incapable of supporting a minimum required transmission rate that is determined by the application. The ACA approach is formulated in terms of a binary optimization problem that is solved using the branch-and-bound method. We assume that the links in the network are Rayleigh faded and we use a finite state Markov chain (FSMC) for their modeling. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed channel assignment approach provides a significant gain in the overall throughput and reduction in the outage probability compared to the SCA","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2006.1696650","startPage":"2279","endPage":"2284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

The influence of each of these factors at frequencies above about 30 megacycles is discussed, with most of the quantitative data being presented in a series of nomograms. By means of three or four of these charts, an estimate of the received power and the received field intensity for a given point-to-point radio transmission path ordinarily can be obtained in a minute or less. The theory of propagation over a smooth spherical earth is presented in a simplified form that is made possible by restricting the frequency range to above about 30 megacycles, where variations in the electrical constants of the earth have only a secondary effect. The empirical methods used in estimating the effects of hills and buildings and of atmospheric refraction are compared with experimental data on shadow losses and on fading ranges.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1947.232600","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35765/01697215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1947.232600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35765","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Propagation at Frequencies above 30 Megacycles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1697215","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio Propagation at Frequencies above 30 Megacycles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1947","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct. 1947","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1947","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Propagation at Frequencies above 30 Megacycles","sourcePdf":"01697215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043177S","chronDate":"Oct. 1947","isNumber":"35765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"133","articleId":"1697215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1947","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1697219,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

The area lying between the spectrum level of the peaks of the speech and the spectrum level of the total noise arrving at the eardrum when plotted on a distorted frequency scale determines a quantity called articulation index which can be correlated with articulation scores.

When linear phase together with finite amplitude bandwidth prevail, the build-up time of the step transient response equals the reciprocal of twice the amplitude bandwidth. However, when phase distortion together with all-pass amplitude characteristics prevail, the finite (rather than zero) step-response build-up time is ascribed to the concept of phase bandwidth. Certain relations between phase and amplitude bandwidths are shown necessary to avoid step and impulse transient response overshoot arising from excessive phase distortion. In particular, attention is confined to networks comprising identical sections in cascade. For most cases of practical interest, it is shown that, as the number of sections increases, cascaded networks have a transmission characteristic approaching that of three networks in cascade. The first network is distortionless and accounts for the pure delay in the system. The other two networks, which account for the distortion in the system, are of two basic species: (1) all-pass networks with a monotonic phase distortion proportional to \u03c9\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n, and (2) zero-phase-shift networks with a monotonic attenuation proportional to \u03c9\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n. Graphs are given of the impulse and step transient responses for such networks with monotonic phase and attenuation distortion. From these are obtained important design data such as the phase bandwidth, the overshoot in the transient responses, the narrowing in effective bandwidth obtained on cascading, etc. An important design parameter determining the transient behavior is the phase distortion at the frequency of amplitude cutoff.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase distortion","Intelligent networks","Bandwidth","Transient response","Cutoff frequency","Delay lines","Attenuation","Broadband amplifiers","Distributed amplifiers","Communication networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1948.230541","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35776/01697498.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1948.230541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase and Amplitude Distortion in Linear Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1697498","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase and Amplitude Distortion in Linear Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697498/","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1948","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1948","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan. 1948","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase and Amplitude Distortion in Linear Networks","sourcePdf":"01697498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041001S","chronDate":"Jan. 1948","isNumber":"35776","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1697498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1697527,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Each channel behaves like a hypothetical waveguide similar to a transmission line made of two conductors in the form of parallel strips. A simple derivation then leads to the radiation resistance of each antenna and to some limitations on the antenna spacing. In the usual flat array of half-wave dipoles, each allotted a half-wave-square area, and backed by a plane reflector at a quarter-wave distance, the radiation resistance of each dipole is 480/\u03c0 = 153 ohms. In a finite array, this derivation is a fair approximation for all antennas except those too close to the edge. This derivation also verifies the known formula for the directive gain of a large flat array in terms of its area. The same viewpoint leads to the radiation resistance of an antenna in a rectangular waveguide, which has previously been derived by more complicated methods.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1948.229650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1948.229650","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35782/01697673.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Radiation Resistance of an Antenna in an Infinite Array or Waveguide","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April 1948","displayDocTitle":"The Radiation Resistance of an Antenna in an Infinite Array or Waveguide","volume":"36","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1948","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1948","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697673/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Radiation Resistance of an Antenna in an Infinite Array or Waveguide","sourcePdf":"01697673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028477S","chronDate":"April 1948","isNumber":"35782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"57","articleId":"1697673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1697674,"authors":[{"name":"C.T.

Using the transient response of the amplifier to a step-voltage input as a basis, design curves have been prepared which allow determination of the necessary amplifier parameters when either the rise time (10 to 90 per cent of final amplitude) and the per cent transient overshoot, or alternatively, the per cent transient overshoot and the net gain, are specified. The effect of changes in-transconductance and resistor values on the output wave form is discussed. The low-frequency distortion of the input wave as a result of the interstage-coupling network is also considered, and a relation for the increase in the effective interstage time constant is derived. The steady-state response of the amplifier is examined in considerable detail, particular emphasis being given to provide an analysis which integrates with the transient study. It is found that an amplifier can be uniquely detemined by means of design curves, provided the overshoot in the steady-state characteristic and the frequency for 3-db attenuation, or alternatively, the midband gain and the overshoot in the steady-state characteristic, are known. In addition, the improvement in steady-state low-frequency response is determined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1948","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1948","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","publicationDate":"May 1948","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Steady-State and Transient Analysis of a Feedback Video Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Steady-State and Transient Analysis of a Feedback Video Amplifier","sourcePdf":"01697695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037576S","chronDate":"May 1948","isNumber":"35783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1697695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1697697,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The results indicate that the presence of the beam in the helix causes the normal mode to break up into three modes with different propagation characteristics. Over a finite range of electron velocities one of the three waves has a negative attenuation, and is thus amplified as it travels along the helix. If the electron velocity is too high or too low for net energy interaction, all three waves have purely imaginary propagation constants; no amplification occurs. Consideration of the beam admittance functions shows that, during amplification, the electron beam behaves like a generator with negative conductance, supplying power to the fields through a net loss of kinetic energy by the electrons. Curves are shown for a typical tube, and the effects of beam current and beam radius are indicated. The initial conditions are investigated, as are the conditions of signal level and limiting efficiency. In the Appendix a simple procedure for computing the attenuation constant is given.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1948.230932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35785","startPage":"853","endPage":"863","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35785/01697743.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field Theory of Traveling-Wave Tubes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1948","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July 1948","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Field Theory of Traveling-Wave Tubes","publicationDate":"July 1948","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Theory of Traveling-Wave Tubes","sourcePdf":"01697743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047116S","chronDate":"July 1948","isNumber":"35785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"33","articleId":"1697743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1697772,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

It is shown that, by an appropriate distribution of ordinary electron tubes along artificial transmission lines, it is possible to obtain amplification over much greater bandwidths than would be possible with ordinary circuits. The ordinary concept of \"maximum bandwidth-gain product\" does not apply to this distributed amplifier. The high-frequency limit of the distributed amplifier appears to be determined by the grid-loading effects. The distributed amplifier provides means for designing amplifiers either of the low-pass or band-pass types. The low-pass amplifiers can be made to have a uniform frequency response from dc to frequencies as high as several hundred Mc using commercially available tubes. The general design considerations included in this paper are: The effect of improper termination of transmission lines; methods for controlling the frequency response and phase characteristic; the design which provides the required gain with fewest possible number of tubes; and a discussion of high-frequency limitations. The noise factor of the amplifier is evaluated. Practical amplifiers, designed according to the principles described in this paper, have been built and have verified the theoretical predictions. Experimental work will be described in a forthcoming paper.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1948.231624","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35786/01697772.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1948.231624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1697772","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1948","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697772/","publicationDate":"Aug. 1948","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug. 1948","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Amplification","sourcePdf":"01697772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040148S","chronDate":"Aug. 1948","isNumber":"35786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"287","articleId":"1697772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1697776,"authors":[{"name":"W.

When the helix is small compared to the wavelength, radiation is maximum normal to the helix axis. Depending on the helix geometry, the radiation may, in theory, be elliptically, plane, or circularly polarized. When the helix circumference is about 1 wavelength, radiation may be maximum in the direction of the helix axis and circularly polarized or nearly so. This mode of radiation, called the axial or beam mode, is generated in practice with great ease, and may be dominant over a wide frequency range with desirable pattern, impedance, and polarization characteristics. The radiation pattern is maintained in the axial mode over wide frequency ranges because of a natural adjustment of the phase velocity of wave propagation on the helix. The terminal impedance is relatively constant over the same frequency range because of the large initial attenuation of waves on the helix. The conditions for circular polarization are analyzed, and the importance of the array factor in determining the radiation pattern of a long helix is discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35793","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35793/01697976.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1949.231279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1949.231279","startPage":"263","endPage":"272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Helical Antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March 1949","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1949","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1697976/","displayDocTitle":"The Helical Antenna","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","publicationDate":"March 1949","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Helical Antenna","sourcePdf":"01697976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058412S","chronDate":"March 1949","isNumber":"35793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"61","articleId":"1697976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1949","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1697990,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

Consideration is given to the necessary conditions for the production of a monotonic time response, expressed in terms of the pole and zero locations. In general, the results of the investigation are limited to stable low-pass systems, having only first-order poles and no poles on the j\u03c9 axis. A method of computing the locations and magnitudes of the maxima and minima in the time response is given which allows the calculations to be made in a straightforward and efficient manner. The evaluation of the transient performance of many practical lowpass systems can be simplified considerably by the use of this method. It is shown that, under certain conditions of pole and zero locations, the normalized time response may be well approximated by a single dominant time term. Methods of ascertaining from the pole and zero pattern whether these conditions exist are given. On the basis of the dominant-term approximation, a method is outlined for the design of pole and zero patterns to yield prescribed time-response characteristics of a certain class to step-function inputs. Constant overshoot-factor curves and charts are provided for this purpose and for rapid solution of analysis problems when applicable.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1949.232649","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35795/01698024.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1949.232649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Pole and Zero Locations on the Transient Response of Linear Dynamic Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1698024","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1949","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Pole and Zero Locations on the Transient Response of Linear Dynamic Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698024/","publicationDate":"May 1949","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1949","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Pole and Zero Locations on the Transient Response of Linear Dynamic Systems","sourcePdf":"01698024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03922S","chronDate":"May 1949","isNumber":"35795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"30","articleId":"1698024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1949","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1698045,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

It was found that the input impedance is a damped oscillating function of wavelength and ground-plane dimensions, the impedance of a circular ground plane varying from \u00b15 to \u00b120 per cent. Similar variations were observed on a square ground plane, which were approximately 50 per cent of those of the circular ground plane except when the dimensions of the ground plane were small. In general, it was found that the impedance is quite critical with respect to the size and shape of the ground plane, and relatively independent of the thickness of the antenna. Measurements were made at microwaves by a modified Chipman method capable of measuring small differences in antenna impedance. Recent emphasis on improved microwave measurement techniques led to the investigation of the merits of the Chipman method as compared to those of the more conventional slotted-line standingwave method. Although the two methods are shown to be closely related from a theoretical viewpoint, practical mechanical and electrical limitations are encountered which dictate preference of method entirely dependent on the application.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1949.233299","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/35796/01698045.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1949.233299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured Impedance of Vertical Antennas over Finite Ground Planes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1698045","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June 1949","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1949","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698045/","displayDocTitle":"Measured Impedance of Vertical Antennas over Finite Ground Planes","volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1949","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured Impedance of Vertical Antennas over Finite Ground Planes","sourcePdf":"01698045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031018S","chronDate":"June 1949","isNumber":"35796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"36","articleId":"1698045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1949","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1698047,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

A theoretical analysis of the equivalent circuit of the device has been made, using the symmetry properties of the structure. The resulting relation among the admittances of the various arms is exactly that of a Wheat-stone bridge with shunting susceptances across each pair of terminals. A device of this sort for use at 10 cm has been built and tested, and was found to behave as predicted. With this bridge it is possible to measure any impedance to about the same accuracy as with a standing-wave detector. A valuable feature of this instrument is that the standard impedances required are three variable reactances (movable shorting plungers) and a Z\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\ntermination. The data are obtained in the form of three lengths, the positions of the movable shorts. Since the device is the complete equivalent of a Wheatstone bridge, it can also be used as a four-terminal lattice section in filter design or in any other related application requiring the microwave equivalent of a lattice section.

We intend it for the records stored once and searched many times in a database or a file, especially those organized in a Scalable Distributed Data Structure, (SDDS), over a grid or a structured P2P net. We presume that the records are encoded into their cumulative algebraic signatures, providing incidental confidentiality of stored data. The search starts with pre-processing the pattern, calculating the logarithmic algebraic signature (LAS) of the pattern and the LASs of every n-gram in it. The value of n \\geqslant 1 is a parameter that one may tune. The search attempts to match the LASs of n-grams in the pattern towards dynamically calculated LASs, sampled over n-grams in the records. A mismatch generates a shift of up to K-n symbols towards next sample, where K is the pattern length. The whole process is parallel over the SDDS servers and does not require any local decoding. For an M-symbol long record, the unsuccessful search, measured as number of match attempts, costs O ((M-K) / (Kn+ 1)). The 2-grams should typically suffice, leading to O ((M-K) / (K-1)). We show that the algorithm particularly efficient for larger strings and records, i.e., with e-documents or DNA data. Preliminary results show then the n-gram search about (K - n + 1) faster than our previous algorithms and among the fastest known, e.g., probably often faster than Boyer-Moore. % MathType!MTEF!2!1!+- % feaafiart1ev1aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn % hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr % 4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq-Jc9 % vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0-yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr-x % fr-xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaeyyzImlaaa!37B3! \\[ \\geqslant \\]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1698345/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9123874","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Invited Paper: Pattern Matching Using n-Gram Sampling of Cumulative Algebraic Signatures: Preliminary Results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited Paper: Pattern Matching Using n-Gram Sampling of Cumulative Algebraic Signatures: Preliminary Results","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"01698345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061861S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11152","isNumber":"35810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11152","xplore-issue":"35810","articleId":"1698345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1698448,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The processor consists of an input port for handling external real-time data, a second input port for exchanging networked inter-processor data, a multi-port RAM, a flag memory, an ALU and a controller. The key benefit of this processor is to be able to handle real-time streaming data through a dedicated port while exchanging data with other processors on a network. Each processor is identical with the exception of the ALU which is custom-tailored for a specific task to simplify processor hardware. Algorithm-dependent wireless communication and multimedia tasks can be implemented using software development on a network of DDPs. This work implements the base-band portion of a simple direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) transmitter using a software platform that requires four networked DDP cores. The transmitter design produced one chip for every 15 clock cycles and 225 clock cycles to process one symbol.

The huge spectral efficiency gains promised by spatial multiplexing schemes, such as vertical Bell Labs space time (V-BLAST) and space-division multiple access (SDMA), are difficult to realize for less than ideal channel conditions. This is particularly true for military applications where extreme channel conditions such as co-channel interference and intentional jamming can be expected. We show that the MSWF, first proposed by Goldstein and Reed for sensor array application, as combined here with spatial multiplexing decoding method successive interference (SIC) leads to significant signal subspace compression or rank-reduction. As a result our solution converges much faster than full rank methods permitting shorter training length and robustness to co-channel interference and jamming. Also, significant computational reduction is realized making this method a good candidate for portable applications where computational resources are limited.

Due to the influence of additive noise and fading in the mobile channel, it is not easy to keep up with the attenuation and offset. This paper considers a recently proposed approach to solve the problem of synchronization chaotic Lu system in CDMA satellite communication in the presence of constant attenuation and offset. An analytic algorithm that provides closed form channel and carrier offset estimates is presented. The principle of this approach is based on adding a compensation block before the receiver to compensate the distortion of the imperfect channel by using genetic algorithm. The resultants presented, show that the receiver is able to recover rapidly the synchronization with the transmitter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Multiaccess communication","Satellite communication","Genetic algorithms","Low earth orbit satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Transmitters","Artificial satellites","Attenuation","Telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","chaotic communication","code division multiple access","fading channels","mobile satellite communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronized chaotic Lu system","CDMA satellite communication","genetic algorithm","additive noise","fading","mobile channel","carrier offset estimates","receiver","transmitter"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDT.2006.73","startPage":"33","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Digital Telecommunications (ICDT'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Digital Telecommunications (ICDT'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11153/35811/01698480.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDT.2006.73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronized Chaotic Lu System in CDMA Satellite Communication Using Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synchronized Chaotic Lu System in CDMA Satellite Communication Using Genetic Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9188748","publicationDate":"2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1698480/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronized Chaotic Lu System in CDMA Satellite Communication Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Cote d'Azur","sourcePdf":"01698480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072899S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11153","isNumber":"35811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11153","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35811","articleId":"1698480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1698495,"authors":[{"name":"Kwon-Ki Hong","affiliation":["Hanyang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwon-Ki Hong","id":"38041099700"},{"name":"Sang-Hun Yoon","affiliation":["Hanyang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Hun Yoon","id":"37422044500"},{"name":"Jong-Wha Chong","affiliation":["Hanyang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Wha Chong","id":"37265185000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2650-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1698495","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","OFDM","Pipeline processing","Parallel processing","Throughput","Ultra wideband technology","Lagrangian functions","Attenuation","Interpolation","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed VP-cubic interpolator","variable parameter-cubic interpolator","MB-OFDM UWB","multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wide band","Lagrange interpolator","lobe edge","pipelining method","parallel processing method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose the structure of high throughput VP-cubic interpolator which can be applied to the system of MB-OFDM UWB (multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra wide band).

Zhang, (1997). And it can be applied to the applicative techniques of OFDM which are sensitive to the attenuation of main lobe edge. However the throughput of the conventional VP-cubic interpolator is lower than the system of MB-OFDM UWB. The conventional structure can not be used directly for the system of MB-OFDM UWB. So, we propose an improved VP-cubic interpolator which has high speed structure by applying the pipelining method and the parallel processing method.

During the compression of image using 2D-DWT two filters are used to evaluate a DWT, a highpass and a lowpass filter, with the filter coefficients derived from the wavelet basis function in each dimension. Among all DWTs, the Haar discrete wavelet transform (Haar DWT) is the simplest and orthogonal one. However, a traditional 2D DWT is applied by sequentially performing two 1D operations one along the rows and the other along the columns of a transformed row image. In other words, the column operation cannot be performed until the row operation is completed. There is decrease in performance due to the memory read and write operations involving intermediate result between row and column operations. Due to this reason, we propose the sequential data input to hierarchical algorithm for Haar DWT. With this technique, we can implement a 2D Haar DWT by data rearrangements, achieving the low memory required to implement being of O (N). The most important characteristic of this algorithm is that the computational process can be extended to image of any size taking the advantage of the block processing of image and data input using diagonal scan algorithm","doi":"10.1109/PARELEC.2006.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PARELEC.2006.29","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel Computing in Electrical Engineering (PARELEC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel Computing in Electrical Engineering (PARELEC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11156/35814/01698659.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of Low Memory Usage Discrete Wavelet Transform on FPGA Using Novel Diagonal Scan","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9176851","htmlLink":"/document/1698659/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Low Memory Usage Discrete Wavelet Transform on FPGA Using Novel Diagonal Scan","confLoc":"Bialystok, Poland","sourcePdf":"01698659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074766S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11156","isNumber":"35814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11156","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"35814","articleId":"1698659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1698662,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The ultimate designed system's performance strongly depends on partitioning. Therefore, achieving the optimum solutions can reduce the systems cost and delay. On the other hand, genetic algorithms (GAs) are powerful function optimizers that are used successfully to solve problems in many different disciplines. Parallel GAs (PGAs) are particularly easy to implement and promise substantial gains in performance and results. In this paper, we present a PGA-based approach to achieve near optimal solutions for HW/SW partitioning problem. To evaluate the proposed system, we have used Task Graphs For Free (TGFF) tool which is used widely in the literature.

The complexity of the problem increases when task scheduling is to be done in a heterogeneous environment, where the processors in the network may not be identical and take different amounts of time to execute the same task. We propose a new genetics-based approach to scheduling parallel tasks on heterogeneous processors. Our approach requires minimal problem specific information and no problem specific operators or repair mechanisms. Key features of our system include a flexible, adaptive problem representation and an incremental fitness function. The selection scheme used in our scheduling algorithm is designed to maintain the genetic diversity within the population by advantageous self adaptive steering of selection pressure. This self-adaptive mechanism referred to as progeny selection in which the fitness of an offspring is compared to the fitness of its own parents. The sufficient amount of \u2018successful\u2019 offspring will become the member of next generation. Comparison with traditional scheduling methods indicates that the new GA is competitive in terms of solution quality if it has sufficient resources to perform its search.","doi":"10.1109/PARELEC.2006.14","startPage":"343","endPage":"348","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel Computing in Electrical Engineering (PARELEC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11156/35814/01698685.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Parallel Computing in Electrical Engineering (PARELEC'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PARELEC.2006.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Task Scheduling Technique in Heterogeneous Systems Using Self-Adaptive Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","Genetic engineering","Computer science","Educational institutions","Scheduling algorithm","Parallel machines","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","parallel machines","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","heterogeneous systems","parallel systems","self-adaptive selection","task scheduling."]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","heterogeneous systems","parallel systems","self-adaptive selection","task scheduling."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Task Scheduling Technique in Heterogeneous Systems Using Self-Adaptive Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1698685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","conferenceDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9176877","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Task Scheduling Technique in Heterogeneous Systems Using Self-Adaptive Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Bialystok, Poland","sourcePdf":"01698685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062356S","chronDate":"13-17 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11156","isNumber":"35814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11156","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"35814","articleId":"1698685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1698693,"authors":[{"name":"G.

About 95% of noun phrases referred to visible software entities, physical devices, or user actions, suggesting the feasibility of allowing users to select these entities in debuggers and other tools.

In particular, the illumination conditions, facial expressions and head pose must be tightly controlled for good recognition performance. In 2004, we proposed a new face recognition algorithm, Adaptive Principal Component Analysis (APCA) [4], which performs well against both lighting variation and expression change. But like other eigenface-derived face recognition algorithms, APCA only performs well with frontal face images. The work presented in this paper is an extension of our previous work to also accommodate variations in head pose. Following the approach of Cootes et al, we develop a face model and a rotation model which can be used to interpret facial features and synthesize realistic frontal face images when given a single novel face image. We use a Viola-Jones based face detector to detect the face in real-time and thus solve the initialization problem for our Active Appearance Model search. Experiments show that our approach can achieve good recognition rates on face images across a wide range of head poses. Indeed recognition rates are improved by up to a factor of 5 compared to standard PCA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2006.527","publicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11159/35817/01698944.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"518","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2006.527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Robust to Head Pose from One Sample Image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Robust to Head Pose from One Sample Image","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1698944/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9209820","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1698944/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Robust to Head Pose from One Sample Image","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01698944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039629S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11159","isNumber":"35817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11159","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"35817","articleId":"1698944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1698994,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The image acquisition system includes basically a CCD progressive camera and a diffuse illumination system mounted on the end-effector of a 6-dof robot. The inspection-robot displaces the image acquisition system over the pieces proceeding from the sheet-metal forming line.

In this paper, a computational framework based on particle filter is proposed for automatic determination of morphological parameters of proximal femur from intraoperative fluoroscopic images. In this framework, the proximal femur is decomposed into three constrained components: (1) femoral head, (2) femoral neck, and (3) femoral shaft. Each component is represented by a set of parameters describing its three-dimensional (3D) spatial position and 3D geometrical shape. Particle filter based inference is then used to estimate those parameters from the acquired fluoroscopic images. The constraints between different components are modeled by a single directional rational network to improve the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.

Based on the audio-visual CHMMs, visual animation parameters are predicted from audio through an EM-based audio to visual conversion algorithm. Experiments on the JEWEL AV database show that compared with the conventional HMMs, the CHMMs can output visual parameters that are much closer to the actual ones.

The proposed MPCA has wide range of applications as a higher-order generalization of PCA. As an example, MPCA is applied to the problem of gait recognition using a novel representation called EigenTensorGait. A gait sequence is divided into half gait cycles and each half cycle, represented as a 3rd-order tensor, is considered as one data sample.

Combining the classifiers using the global features and the local features, we obtain a cascade classifier. The classifiers based on global features decrease the complexity of the system.

This paper presents a novel approach to the localization problem based on recursive neural networks (RNNs), In particular, a recursive learning paradigm is proposed to process directed acyclic graphs with labeled edges, and to realize mappings between graphs which are isomorph, i.e. that share the same topology of the links. The RNN model, that assumes a graph-based representation of images, uses a state transition function that depends on the edge labels and is independent from both the number and the order of the children of each node. Moreover, the presence of targets attached to the internal nodes guarantees a fast learning, particularly sensitive to the local features of the graph.

The important task is to associate a target of interest with its previous appearances across time and space within the camera network. In this paper, we propose a unified tracking framework using Particle Filter to efficiently switch between track prediction (to deal with non-overlapping region tracking) and visual tracking. The Particle Filter tracking system uses a map to provide the possible trajectory information of the target as it moves within the non-overlapping regions. We implemented and tested this tracking approach in an in-house multiple cameras system.

We develop a virtual reality based driving training system of Self-Propelled Gun (SPG). For this system, a DataGlove with 18 sensors is employed to perform some driving tasks such as pressing switches, manipulating steering wheel, changing gears, etc. To accomplish these tasks, some hand gestures must be defined from the DataGlove sensors data. A feedforward neural network can represent an arbitrary functional mapping so it is possible to map raw data directly to the required hand gestures. This paper uses BP neural network to recognize the hand patterns which exist in the raw sensor data of the DataGlove. A pattern set of 300 hand gestures is used to train and test the neural network. The recognition system achieves good performance. It can be effectively used in our virtual reality training system of SPG to perform various manipulating tasks in a more fast, precise, and natural way.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1699578/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9210010","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1699578/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Approach for Hand Gesture Recognition in Virtual Reality Driving Training System of SPG","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Approach for Hand Gesture Recognition in Virtual Reality Driving Training System of SPG","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01699578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038847S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11159","isNumber":"35819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11159","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"35819","articleId":"1699578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1699586,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Nong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Nong Chen","id":"37657231200"},{"name":"Chin-Chuan Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Chuan Han","id":"37290294700"},{"name":"Cheng-Tzu Wang","affiliation":["Instit. of Informatics, Fo-Guang University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Tzu Wang","id":"37599169800"},{"name":"Bor-Shenn Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Shenn Jeng","id":"37268599700"},{"name":"Kuo-Chin Fan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Chin Fan","id":"37269439500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2521-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-4651"}],"articleNumber":"1699586","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1392},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of a Convolution Neural Network on Face and License Plate Detection","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11159/35819/01699586.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2006.1115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35819","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2006.1115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Convolution","Neural networks","Licenses","Computer science","Detectors","Computer vision","Humans","Feature extraction","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","object detection","self-organising feature maps","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face detection","license plate detection","convolutional neural network verifier","multilayer perceptron training","pyramid-based localization","geometrical rules"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1699586","abstract":"In this paper, two detectors, one for face and the other for license plates, are proposed, both based on a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) verifier.

This paper presents two p re-processings in order to remove such noises for crack detection. First, slight variations like irregularly illuminated conditions and shading are removed from concrete images by the subtraction pre-processing with the smoothed image. Secondly, a line filter based on the Hessian matrix is used to emphasize line structures associated with cracks. Finally, thresholding processing is used to separate cracks from background. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by ROC analysis with 50 real images.

In this research field, 3D provides a significant improvement in recognition performances, but the existing approaches show limitations dealing with pose variations; indeed 3D face surfaces need to be aligned before the matching operation. This paper proposes an approach that overcomes this limitation by projecting the 3D shape information onto the 2D surface of a normal sphere, while a rotation invariant descriptor is used to extract key features from this surface. In addition, using a 2D descriptor reduces the computing time that is a typical drawback of 3D methods. Experimentations have been conducted on a property face dataset, to assess the robustness of the method with respect to a large set of facial expression and pose variations","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2006.25","publicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/11159/35819/01699737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2006.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=35819","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Normal Sphere and General Fourier Descriptor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1699737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition using Normal Sphere and General Fourier Descriptor","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1699737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9210143","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1699737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition using Normal Sphere and General Fourier Descriptor","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"01699737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055033S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11159","isNumber":"35819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11159","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"35819","articleId":"1699737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1699738,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The curvelets is used to perform the multiscale self-adaptive enhancement transform on the finger-vein image and a neural network with local interconnection structure is designed to extract the features of the finger-vein pattern. This method has the following features: firstly, the feature of finger-vein is line feature, or anisotropy, which is more suitable to be processed by curvelets than wavelets, especially when dealing with the obscure anisotropic features. Secondly, when the multiscale self-adaptive enhancement transform is applied to the finger-vein image, the finger-vein pattern is emphasized and noises are refrained greatly. Thirdly, a local interconnection neural network with linear receptive field is designed to deal with finger-vein patterns of different thickness and capture the patterns. Fourthly, the method is very fast by using the integral image method. The experimental results show the proposed method is superior to other methods in finger-vein feature extraction and solve the problem of how to extract features from obscure images efficiently.

In this paper, we propose to use a class of convolutional neural networks for gender classification. These networks are built upon the concepts of local receptive field processing and weight sharing, which makes them more tolerant to distortions and variations in two dimensional shapes. Tested on two separate data sets, the proposed networks achieve better classification accuracy than the conventional feedforward multilayer perceptron networks.

The light incident from a scene point is split and directed to the camera in two parts. One part reaches camera directly after reflection from the convex mirror and forms a single-viewpoint omnidirectional image. The second part is formed by passing a subbeam of the reflected light from the mirror through a concave lens and forms a displaced single viewpoint image where the disparity depends on the depth of the scene point. A closed-form expression for depth is derived. Since the optical components used are simple and commercially available, the resulting system is compact and inexpensive. This, and the simplicity of the required image processing algorithms, make the proposed system attractive for real-time applications, such as autonomous navigation and object manipulation.
