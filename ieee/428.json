In the acceleration control, fast sampling rate is a key issue to improve the performance of robustness. By using FPGAs, faster sampling rates can be achieved than those using PCs. The sampling rates of the systems using FPGAs can be faster than the frequency of PWM wave. In that case, the performance of the acceleration control is not improved as expected. The frequency of the PWM wave becomes a performance limitation of the system. In this paper, a position control system based on acceleration control using multirate sampling method is implemented into an FPGA to overcome the limitations. In these multirate systems, the sampling rates of the system output and control calculations are faster than that of the system input. Experimental results show that the robustness of the system can be improved, even though the sampling rates of the system output and the control calculations are faster than the PWM frequency by using the multirate sampling method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position control","Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Sampling methods","Pulse width modulation","Robust control","Frequency","Control systems","Motion control","Personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","control engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","motion control","position control","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control system","FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","multirate acceleration control","disturbance observer","robust motion control","fast sampling rate","multirate sampling method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4280033","doi":"10.1109/ICMECH.2007.4280033","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4279972/4279973/04280033.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4279973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMECH.2007.4280033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4280033/","displayDocTitle":"Position Control Using an FPGA based on Multirate Acceleration Control","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9719452","htmlLink":"/document/4280033/","conferenceDate":"8-10 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position Control Using an FPGA based on Multirate Acceleration Control","confLoc":"Kumamoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"ICMECH-07-00-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064268S","chronDate":"8-10 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4279972","isNumber":"4279973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4279972","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4279973","articleId":"4280033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4280056,"authors":[{"name":"Nasser Sadati","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Sadati","id":"37266047300"},{"name":"Majid Zamani","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Zamani","id":"37297776500"},{"name":"Peyman Mohajerin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Mohajerin","id":"37936498900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1183-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1184-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4280056","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":518},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel design approach for determination of the optimal fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers, using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is presented.

The Z-source inverter is a recently proposed single-stage power converter, and it is capable of operating in both buck and boost modes. Hence, this inverter gives an economical solution for power conversion in distributed generation (DG) applications, particularly by eliminating the need for a two-stage conversion. Moreover, applications such as DG demand quality output waveforms, and additionally, when the system is subjected to input- and load-side disturbances, their effects need to be minimized. This can be achieved with closed-loop controlling. Toward this end, the system is modeled first with large- and small-signal modeling techniques, and relevant transfer functions are derived. The dc-side of the Z-source inverter shows a non-minimum-phase characteristic, and the output voltage of a Z-source impedance network shows a significant overshoot and undershoot, following a step change in the input due to energy resettling. These effects could be transferred to the ac-side, giving rise to the undershoot and overshoot in the ac output as well. Hence, the proposed controllers should be able to minimize such effects. The ac- and dc-sides are considered separately when designing the controllers. An indirect controller is employed in the dc-side, whereas the ac-side controller is designed in the synchronous reference frame. The modulation index, shoot-through time, and saturation levels are appropriately selected so that the dc-side effects are prevented from propagating into the ac-side. The simulation results are obtained using a state-space-averaged inverter model, and an experimental prototype is built in a laboratory to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

The leakage inductance of the transformer or an additional resonant inductance is employed to achieve ZVS during the dead times. The duty cycles are not limited to be equal and within 50%. The complementary switchings and the resulted interleaved output inductor currents diminish the current ripple in output capacitors. Accordingly, the smaller output chokes and capacitors lower the converter volume and increase the power density.

A novel packaging process is developed to enable on-chip fluorescence imaging. The sensor chip is attached to a flexible polyimide substrate and sealed in epoxy. A thin-film resist is spin-coated directly onto the image sensor chip for excitation light filtering. By applying multiple coating, a transmittance below -44 dB is achieved. Also, the device has a selectivity of more than 80% for the fluorescence emission of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). The entire packaged device is about 350 \u00d7m thick, hence minimizing injury during invasive imaging inside the brain. In vivo functional imaging is performed by using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate which detects the presence of two serine proteases species in the brain. The introduction of kainic acid induces the expression of these protease species, which then reacts with the substrate to release the AMC fluorophore. Imaging of the AMC fluorescence allows the serine protease activity to be measured in real-time. We have successfully measured the protease activity and accurately determined its reaction onset.","doi":"10.1109/MMB.2006.251531","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microtechnologies in Medicine and Biology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Microtechnologies in Medicine and Biology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4017301/4281284/04281349.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMB.2006.251531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4281284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Chip In vivo Functional Imaging of the Mouse Brain Using a CMOS Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4281349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4281349/","displayDocTitle":"On-Chip In vivo Functional Imaging of the Mouse Brain Using a CMOS Image Sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9296589","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4281349/","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Chip In vivo Functional Imaging of the Mouse Brain Using a CMOS Image Sensor","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"MMB-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06256S","chronDate":"9-12 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4017301","isNumber":"4281284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4017301","xplore-issue":"4281284","articleId":"4281349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4281375,"authors":[{"name":"Takafumi Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Information Physics and Computing, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37334198500"},{"name":"Naoki Kotake","affiliation":["Department of Information Physics and Computing, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Kotake","id":"37701999600"},{"name":"Kunihiko Mabuchi","affiliation":["Department of Information Physics and Computing, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunihiko","lastName":"Mabuchi","id":"37275529300"},{"name":"Shoji Takeuchi","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37275286500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0337-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0338-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4281375","dbTime":"67 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Microfluidics","Humans","Nervous system","Control systems","Neural prosthesis","Microelectrodes","Micromechanical devices","Nerve fibers","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial limbs","biocontrol","bioMEMS","microelectrodes","microfluidics","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel regeneration-type nerve electrode","integrated microfluidic channels","neural interface","human nervous system","prosthetic systems","peripheral nerves","artificial hand control","artificial sensations","microelectrode","MEMS technologies","parylene C substrate","axons","probes","sciatic nerve","20 micron","100 micron","40 micron","1500 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Probe","Nerve Regeneration","Fluidic Channels"]}],"abstract":"The development of a neural interface that will allow signals from the human nervous system to control external equipment is extremely important for the next generation of prosthetic systems.

Load recognition for identifying loads being connected and disconnected is applied to a NILM by using a neural network, especially for industrial electrical loads, even though some loads are activated at the nearly same time. In order to accurately decompose the aggregate load into its components, a feature-based model for describing the signatures of individual appliances and load combinations is used. The model will suggest the certain signatures which can be detected for all loads in order to indicate the activities of the separate components. To verify the performance of the model for the features selection, the data sets of the electrical loads and the load recognition techniques apply an electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and a neural network, respectively. The effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition are analyzed and compared by using the back propagation classifier and the learning vector quantization classifier. To obtain a maximum recognition accuracy rate, the calculation of the turn-on transient energy signature employs a window of samples, \u0394t, to adaptively segment a transient representative of a class of loads. Experiments performed with a variety of model data sets which reveal the back propagation classifier is superior to the learning quantization classifier in the effectiveness and computation equipment of load recognition.","doi":"10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281579","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1027","publicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4281390","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 11th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4281389/4281390/04281579.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design a Neural Network for Features Selection in Non-intrusive Monitoring of Industrial Electrical Loads","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4281579/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design a Neural Network for Features Selection in Non-intrusive Monitoring of Industrial Electrical Loads","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4281579/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9720165","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design a Neural Network for Features Selection in Non-intrusive Monitoring of Industrial Electrical Loads","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"CSCWD-00-189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071164S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4281389","isNumber":"4281390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4281389","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4281390","articleId":"4281579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4281627,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Computer School, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598773100"},{"name":"Xinjie Wang","affiliation":["Communications & Electronics College, Qingdao Technological University, China"],"firstName":"Xinjie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066317000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-302-13922-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"7-900718-14-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4281627","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image processing","Hafnium","Systems engineering and theory","Image analysis","Wavelet domain","Low pass filters","Application software","Communications technology","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable image coding method","multiwavelet transform","image processing","transmission-oriented image coding method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiwavelet transform","FGS coding","CL multiwavelet","high-definition image"]}],"abstract":"Multiwavelet transform has important traits in image processing such as symmetric, orthogonal, smoothness, and short support.

It predicts and evaluates conditions of buffer queues through FNN, and directs space allocation of each queue through constructing an evaluation function. Thus, this model is able to control congestion condition of each queue and resize allocation of queues in the buffer automatically, and then it can avoid lock-out of the buffer by dropping packets actively before the buffer is overflow.

The compensator uses two neural networks, one to estimate the unknown actuator nonlinearities and another to provide adaptive compensation in the feedforward path. Since radial basis function network has the universal approximation property and can avoid the local minima problem, the compensator uses RBF neural networks to estimate the actuator nonlinearities and eliminate their effects. GL matrix and operator are introduced to help prove the stability of the system. Rigorous proofs of closed-loop stability for the compensator are provided and yield turning algorithms for the weights of the RBF neural networks. The whole scheme provides a general procedure for using RBF neural networks to compensate the actuator nonlinearities in robot control system. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the designed scheme and the theoretical discussion.","doi":"10.1109/CESA.2006.4281655","pdfPath":"/iel5/4105550/4281602/04281655.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"238","displayPublicationTitle":"The Proceedings of the Multiconference on \"Computational Engineering in Systems Applications\"","publicationTitle":"The Proceedings of the Multiconference on \"Computational Engineering in Systems Applications\"","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CESA.2006.4281655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4281602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actuator Nonlinearities Compensation Using RBF Neural Networks in Robot Control System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4281655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Actuator Nonlinearities Compensation Using RBF Neural Networks in Robot Control System","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10301809","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4281655/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actuator Nonlinearities Compensation Using RBF Neural Networks in Robot Control System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"CESA-1-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060374S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4105550","isNumber":"4281602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4105550","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4281602","articleId":"4281655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IMACS","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4281656,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-Jun Hao","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","School of Computer, Beihang University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Jun","lastName":"Hao","id":"37553627000"},{"name":"Guo-Liang Liu","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37836599100"},{"name":"She-Yang Wang","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"She-Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37934920500"},{"name":"Wen-Yi Qiang","affiliation":["School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yi","lastName":"Qiang","id":"37299652400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-302-13922-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"7-900718-14-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4281656","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"abstract":"The adaptive fuzzy Control scheme based on high gain observer is proposed for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems involving plant uncertainties and external disturbances.

Dynamic power management policies exploit components' idle periods to save energy. If one idle period of some component is long enough, the component can be put into low power state during this period in order to reduce energy consumption. Many dynamic power management policies are based on predicting lengths of components' future idle periods. The more accurate the prediction is, the more efficient the policy is. This paper proposes a novel idea of using genetic algorithm to predict lengths of future idle periods. We take K adjacent idle periods and active periods as a load-gene and define some kinds of relationships between adjacent load-genes, then use genetic algorithm to predict future load-genes that most accords with the relationships.

Density evolution is employed in theoretical analysis to get optimal initial value for SPA. Based on the results, a modified SPA algorithm is proposed. When decoding using this modified SPA algorithm, no channel information is needed at the decoder side. This will be of significant value for time-varying channels. Theoretical claims from density evolution are confirmed by extensive simulations. Our simulations show that by fixing the initial value for all channel conditions, decoding performance can be improved. One channel state estimation algorithm is proposed in this paper based on the error detection ability of LDPC codes. Maximum number of iterations taken when decoding a LDPC code can be dynamically adjusted according to the estimated channel state.

Issues such as learning speed, stability, and weight convergence remain as areas of research and comparison of many training algorithms. This paper discusses the application of neural networks to control interior permanent magnet synchronous motor using direct torque control (DTC). A neural network is used to emulate the state selector of the DTC. The neural networks used in this paper are the back-propagation, radial basis function. In order to reduce the training patterns and increase the execution speed of the training process, the inputs of switching table is converted to digital signals, i.e., one bit represent the flux error, one bit the torque error and three bits the region of stator flux. Computer simulations of the motor and neural-network system using the two approaches are presented and compared. Discussions about the back-propagation and radial basis function as the most promising training techniques are presented, giving its advantages and disadvantages. The system using back-propagation and radial basis function networks controller has quickly parallel speed and high torque response.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4281937/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10311653","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4281937/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks Implementation of Direct Torque Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks Implementation of Direct Torque Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"CESA-2-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.159418S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4105550","isNumber":"4281806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4105550","xplore-issue":"4281806","articleId":"4281937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IMACS","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4281946,"authors":[{"name":"Xianqing Cao","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenyang Institute of chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xianqing","lastName":"Cao","id":"37290375800"},{"name":"Chunhua Zang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenyang Institute of chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Zang","id":"37300123100"},{"name":"Liping Fan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenyang Institute of chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Fan","id":"37289968000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-302-13922-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"7-900718-14-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4281946","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4281946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Direct Torque Controlled Drive for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Neural Networks","abstract":"For permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) direct torque controlled (DTC) drive, stator resistance variation and conventional hysteresis controller will bring high flux linkage and torque ripples inevitably.

This intelligent system is composed of a preprocessor, an array of neural networks (NN) and an interpreter. The preprocessor partitions the whole set of synchronous machines into subsets, each one including only two generators. Each subset is assigned to one NN, which extracts the input/ output mapping function of that subset. Then, the interpreter combines the responses of the NNs in a voting procedure to determine the transient stability status of the power system. This mechanism can cover the probable errors of the NNs, increasing the accuracy of the final response of the hybrid intelligent system. In addition to the transient stability status, this intelligent system can determine tripped generators and islanded parts of the power system for unstable cases. The proposed method has been examined on the PSB4 and New England test systems.

Variance estimation and expected return are based on a forecasted scenario interval determined by a price range forecasting model developed by the authors. A certain confidence level alpha is associated to each forecasted scenario interval. The proposed model makes use of contracts with physical (spot and forward) and financial (options) settlement. PSO performance was evaluated by comparing it with a genetic algorithm-based approach. This model can be used by producers in deregulated electricity markets but can easily be adapted to load serving entities and retailers. Moreover, it can easily be adapted to the use of other type of contracts.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901463","startPage":"995","endPage":"1003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decision-Support System Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Multiperiod Hedging in Electricity Markets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Electricity supply industry","Business","Predictive models","Knowledge engineering","Character generation","Power generation","Economic forecasting","Forward contracts","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision support systems","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","power markets","power system management","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-support system","particle swarm optimization","electricity markets","producer risk preference","variance estimation","expected return","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contracts","electricity markets","genetic algorithms","hedging","particle swarm optimization","risk management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Decision-Support System Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Multiperiod Hedging in Electricity Markets","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4282008/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9616011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decision-Support System Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Multiperiod Hedging in Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-azevedo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093605S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4282011,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Causebrook","affiliation":["Electrical Machines and Drives Group, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4282002/4282011/4282011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Causebrook received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College, London, U.K., in 1986 and the M.Sc. degree in renewable energy technology from Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 1998.

Fixed speed wind turbines (FSWTs) are a diminishing but significant sector in the fast-growing wind turbine (WT) market. State-of-art techniques applied to meet grid requirements for FSWT wind farms are blade pitching and dynamic reactive power compensation (RPC). Blade pitching is constrained by the onerous mechanical loads imposed on a wind turbine during rapid power restoration. Dynamic RPC is constrained by its high capital cost. These present technologies can therefore be limiting, especially when connecting to smaller power systems. A novel alternative technology is proposed that inserts series resistance into the generation circuit. The series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR) dissipates active power and boosts generator voltage, potentially displacing the need for pitch control and dynamic RPC. This paper uses a representative wind farm model to study the beneficial effect of SDBR compared to dynamic RPC. This is achieved by quasi-steady-state characterization and transient FRT stability simulations. The analysis shows that SDBR can substantially improve the FRT performance of a FSWT wind farm.

Taking advantages of the flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices depends largely on how these devices are placed in the power system, namely, on their location and size. In addition to their primary function, the supplementary damping control action can be also added, and how to utilize their control capabilities effectively as stabilizing aids is becoming very important. In this paper, power system stability is used as an index for optimal allocation of the controllers. First, several SVCs are placed optimally based on modal analysis and genetic algorithm in a power system. After placing the SVCs based on their primary functions, the most appropriate input signal for supplementary controller is also selected. The frequency response characteristics of the system for all located SVCs are determined in selecting the best input signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282024.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1071","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Placement of SVCs and Selection of Stabilizing Signals in Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Placement of SVCs and Selection of Stabilizing Signals in Power Systems","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4282024/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617762","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Placement of SVCs and Selection of Stabilizing Signals in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-farsangi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081318S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4282029,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Glickman","affiliation":["School of Engineering Systems, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4282002/4282029/4282029-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark Glickman received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), Melbourne, Australia, in December 2002.

The reasonable network reconfiguration is necessary for establishing the main network and restoring loads quickly. Based on topological characteristics of scale-free networks and discrete particle swarm optimization, a skeleton-network reconfiguration strategy is proposed in this paper. Through calculating node importance degrees, priorities of sources and loads could be scaled quantitatively. Then, network reconfiguration efficiency, an index represented by network structure and subjected to restoration constrains, is used to evaluate the reconfiguration effect. Furthermore, discrete particle swarm optimization is employed in reconstructing skeleton networks that relieve reconfiguration burden considerably. Application examples verify that several optimal reconfiguration schemes achieved from the strategy can provide dispatchers an effective decision support under the uncertain system situation.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901486","startPage":"1267","endPage":"1274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282039.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skeleton-Network Reconfiguration Based on Topological Characteristics of Scale-Free Networks and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power system restoration","Power system reliability","Power system faults","Power system measurements","Power supplies","Power system management","Power measurement","Safety","Power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","network topology","particle swarm optimisation","power system restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skeleton-network reconfiguration","topological characteristics","scale-free networks","discrete particle swarm optimization","power system black start","power system restoration","power system blackout","power system safety","node importance degrees","network reconfiguration efficiency","network structure","restoration constrains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Black start","network reconfiguration","power systems","particle swarm optimization","scale-free networks","system restoration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Skeleton-Network Reconfiguration Based on Topological Characteristics of Scale-Free Networks and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4282039/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9606466","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeleton-Network Reconfiguration Based on Topological Characteristics of Scale-Free Networks and Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110914S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":4282040,"authors":[{"name":"Alicia Troncoso Lora","affiliation":["University Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Alicia Troncoso Lora was born in Carmona, Spain, in 1974.

Despite the fact that increasing accuracy in spot forecasts may reduce penalties, this paper shows that, if such forecasts are accompanied with information on their uncertainty, i.e., in the form of predictive distributions, then this can be the basis for defining advanced strategies for market participation. Such strategies permit to further increase revenues and thus enhance competitiveness of wind generation compared to other forms of dispatchable generation. This paper formulates a general methodology for deriving optimal bidding strategies based on probabilistic forecasts of wind generation, as well as on modeling of the sensitivity a wind power producer may have to regulation costs. The benefits resulting from the application of these strategies are clearly demonstrated on the test case of the participation of a multi-MW wind farm in the Dutch electricity market over a year.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282048/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9607865","volume":"22","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trading Wind Generation From Short-Term Probabilistic Forecasts of Wind Power","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trading Wind Generation From Short-Term Probabilistic Forecasts of Wind Power","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-pinson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131872S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"382","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4282051,"authors":[{"name":"Joe A.

This paper investigates whether a degree of built-in frequency stability could be provided by incorporating dynamic demand control into certain consumer appliances. Such devices would monitor system frequency (a universally available indicator of supply-demand imbalance) and switch the appliance on or off accordingly, striking a compromise between the needs of the appliance and the grid. A simplified computer model of a power grid was created incorporating aggregate generator inertia, governor action and load-frequency dependence plus refrigerators with dynamic demand controllers. Simulation modelling studies were carried out to investigate the system's response to a sudden loss of generation, and to fluctuating wind power. The studies indicated a significant delay in frequency-fall and a reduced dependence on rapidly deployable backup generation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","startPage":"1284","endPage":"1293","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of Grid Frequency Through Dynamic Demand Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282051/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of Grid Frequency Through Dynamic Demand Control","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610063","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization of Grid Frequency Through Dynamic Demand Control","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-short.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064525S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"469","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4282054,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The time range in focus is between one minute and up to a couple of hours. In this time range, substantial power fluctuations have been observed during unstable weather conditions. A wind power fluctuation model is described, and measured time series from the first large offshore wind farm, Horns Rev in Denmark, are compared to simulated time series. The comparison between measured and simulated time series focuses on the ramping characteristics of the wind farm at different power levels and on the need for system generation reserves due to the fluctuations. The comparison shows a reasonable agreement between simulations and measurements, although there is still room for improvement of the simulation model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","volume":"22","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9617766","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282056/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Power Fluctuations From Large Wind Farms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Fluctuations From Large Wind Farms","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-sorensen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086476S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4282059,"authors":[{"name":"George J.

In the second stage, classification of customers is performed by the same methods and measures, together with the representative load patterns of customers being obtained from the first stage. The results of the first stage can be used for load forecasting of customers and determination of tariffs. The results of the second stage provide valuable information for electricity suppliers in competitive energy markets. The developed methodology is applied on a set of medium voltage customers of the Greek power system, and the obtained results are presented and discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Vector quantization","Load forecasting","Performance evaluation","Medium voltage","Power systems","Costs","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy","Clustering methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","customer profiles","pattern recognition","power consumption","power distribution economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","load curve","electricity customers","Kohonen adaptive vector quantization","fuzzy k-means method","hierarchical clustering method","electricity supplier","competitive energy market","medium voltage customer","Greek power system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive vector quantization","chronological load patterns","clustering","customer classes","fuzzy k-means","hierarchical clustering","k-means","pattern recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282059.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Pattern Recognition of Load Curves for Classification of Electricity Customers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Pattern Recognition of Load Curves for Classification of Electricity Customers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282059/","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282059/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9608298","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Pattern Recognition of Load Curves for Classification of Electricity Customers","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-tsekouras.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068265S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":4282060,"authors":[{"name":"Hongye Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4282002/4282060/4282060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongye Wang (S'99) received the B.S. degree in physics from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 1998, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2001.

The operation principles of the proposed system are described, and new control strategies for normal and grid fault conditions are proposed. To obtain smooth operation, the wind farm side VSC (WFVSC) is controlled as an infinite voltage source that automatically absorbs power generated by the wind farm and maintains a stable local ac network. Fault ride through of the system during grid ac faults is achieved by ensuring automatic power balancing through frequency modulation using WFVSC and frequency control using DFIG. PSCAD/EMTDC simulations are presented to demonstrate robust performance during wind speed and power variations and to validate the fault ride through capability of the proposed system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4282002/04282062.pdf","startPage":"976","endPage":"984","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.901306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid Integration of Large DFIG-Based Wind Farms Using VSC Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind farms","Converters","Power conversion","Induction generators","Voltage","HVDC transmission","Joining processes","Automatic control","Control systems","Automatic generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid integration","DFIG-based wind farm","voltage source converter based HVDC transmission system","VSC transmission technology","doubly fed induction generator based wind farm","wind speed","power variation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter","doubly fed induction generator","fault ride through","frequency modulation","high voltage dc transmission (HVDC)","voltage source converter (VSC) transmission","wind farm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Grid Integration of Large DFIG-Based Wind Farms Using VSC Transmission","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4282062/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607866","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid Integration of Large DFIG-Based Wind Farms Using VSC Transmission","sourcePdf":"22tpwrs03-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060005S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4282002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"275","xplore-issue":"4282002","articleId":"4282062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4282073,"authors":[{"name":"Guido De Sandre","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Agrate, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4282065/4282073/4282073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guido De Sandre received the engineering degree (cum laude) in electronic engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 1995.","From 1997 he attended Ph.D. studies at the Department of Electronics and Information (DEI) of Politecnico di Milano.

The dynamics of FR-CNNs, which is described by a differential inclusion, is rigorously analyzed by means of theoretical tools from set-valued analysis and differential inclusions. The fundamental property proved in the paper is that FR-CNNs are equivalent to a special class of differential inclusions termed differential variational inequalities. A sound foundation to the dynamics of FR-CNNs is then given by establishing the existence and uniqueness of the solution starting at a given point, and the existence of equilibrium points. Moreover, a fundamental result on trajectory convergence towards equilibrium points (complete stability) for reciprocal standard CNNs is extended to reciprocal FR-CNNs by using a generalized Lyapunov approach. As a consequence, it is shown that the study of the ideal case with vertical straight segments in the neuron nonlinearities is able to give a clear picture and analytic characterization of the salient features of motion, such as the sliding modes along the boundary of the hypercube defined by the hard-comparator nonlinearities. Finally, it is proved that the solutions of the ideal FR model are the uniform limit as the slope tends to infinity of the solutions of a model where the vertical segments in the nonlinearities are approximated by segments with finite slope.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4282065/04282073.pdf","startPage":"1736","endPage":"1749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.902607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.902607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical Analysis of Full-Range Cellular Neural Networks by Exploiting Differential Variational Inequalities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Very large scale integration","Stability","Motion analysis","Hypercubes","H infinity control","Linear matrix inequalities","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","comparators (circuits)","convergence","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear dynamical systems","set theory","stability","variational techniques","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamical analysis","full-range cellular neural networks model","differential variational inequalities","neuron nonlinearities","ideal hard-comparator functions","differential inclusion","set-valued analysis","trajectory convergence","generalized Lyapunov approach","sliding modes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular neural networks (CNNs)","differential inclusions","full-range (FR) model","sliding modes","trajectory convergence","variational inequalities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical Analysis of Full-Range Cellular Neural Networks by Exploiting Differential Variational Inequalities","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4282073/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9609986","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical Analysis of Full-Range Cellular Neural Networks by Exploiting Differential Variational Inequalities","sourcePdf":"54tcsi08-desandre.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10224S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4282065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4282065","articleId":"4282073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4282078,"authors":[{"name":"Honghao Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4282065/4282078/4282078-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Honghao Ji (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, the M.S. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from the Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, in 1995, 1998, and 2006, respectively.","He joined Cadence Design Systems, Columbia, MD, in 2006, where he is a Senior Member of Technical Staff in the Analog/Mixed-signal Design Group and has been focused on analog/mixed-signal ASIC design."]},"firstName":"Honghao","lastName":"Ji","id":"37331470400"},{"name":"David Sander","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4282065/4282078/4282078-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["David Sander (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 2004.

We studied how this distance affects image quality using a commercial optical simulator. Simulation results show that the image quality degrades as objects move away from the sensor surface. To experimentally validate these results, an image sensor was designed and fabricated in a commercially available three metal, two poly, 0.5 mum CMOS technology.

Although schemes were in existence for performing the encoding operation in parallel, the data dependencies involved in the decoding phase prevented its parallel execution. This paper presents a scheme for the parallel-pipelined implementation of both the phases of the arithmetic-coding algorithm for multisymbol alphabets in high-speed programmable hardware. The compression performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated and compared with an existing sequential implementation in terms of average compression ratio as well as the estimated execution time for the Canterbury Corpus test set of files. The proposed scheme facilitates hardware realization of both coder and decoder modules by reducing the storage capacity necessary for maintaining the modeling information. The design has been synthesized for Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays and the synthesis results obtained are encouraging, paving the way for further research in this direction.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4282065/04282082.pdf","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.902527","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.902527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Implementation of Multi-Alphabet Arithmetic Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Implementation of Multi-Alphabet Arithmetic Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282082/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282082/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608234","volume":"54","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Implementation of Multi-Alphabet Arithmetic Coding","sourcePdf":"54tcsi08-mahapatra.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151621S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4282065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4282065","articleId":"4282082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282090,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyi L.

The adaptation mechanism stores a reference image, which may be uniform for FPN cancellation or nonuniform for various imaging applications. The design has been fabricated in a commercially available 3-metal, 2-poly 0.5-mum standard CMOS technology. Experimental results confirm the ability to reduce the FPN variance by a factor of 178x at the intensity at which adaptation was performed, and by a factor of 34x over five orders of magnitude of intensity. Adaptation takes as little as 4 s and the 144 times 144 image can be acquired at 0.9 frames/s.

Most of these tools require a properly selected matching network topology with good initial element values. Therefore, in this paper, a practical method is presented to generate matching networks with initial element values. In the implementation process of the proposed method first, the driving point immitance data for the matching network is obtained in a straight forward manner without optimization. Then, it is modeled as a realizable bounded-real input reflection coefficient which in turn yields the desired matching network with reasonable element values. Eventually, the initial design is improved by optimizing the performance of the matched system employing the commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) packages. An example is given to illustrate the utilization of the proposed method. It is shown that new method provides excellent results as a front-end when utilized together with CAD tools.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.902411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4282065/04282091.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.902411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Practical Matching Networks With Lumped Elements Via Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Practical Matching Networks With Lumped Elements Via Modeling","volume":"54","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606396","htmlLink":"/document/4282091/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Practical Matching Networks With Lumped Elements Via Modeling","sourcePdf":"54tcsi08-yarman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102878S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4282065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4282065","articleId":"4282091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4282093,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Zarei","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Austin, TX, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4282065/4282093/4282093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Zarei was born in Fasa, Iran, in 1975.

The basic idea is to adjust the flux reference on the basis of the torque error, thus determining a spontaneous flux weakening. To exploit the maximum torque capability, it is necessary to estimate the maximum torque that the induction machine is able to generate at any speed. Initially, a basic version of the algorithm, requiring a simple off-line parameter tuning, is presented. Then, the algorithm is improved and completed with the online estimation of the maximum torque, hence avoiding the initial tuning process. The main features of the proposed methods are a little dependence on machine parameters and a smooth transition into and out of the flux-weakening operation mode.

The proposed solutions represent effective ways to reach this goal. The described algorithms are grouped into three categories: i) we first introduce algorithms for adaptive iterative detection, where the unknown channel parameters are explicitly estimated; ii) then, we consider finite-memory iterative detection algorithms, based on ad hoc truncation of the channel memory and often interpretable as based on an implicit estimation of the channel parameters; and iii) finally, we present a general detection-theoretic approach to derive optimal detection algorithms with polynomial complexity.

But since the introduction of turbo codes in 1993, much more powerful codes referred to collectively as turbo and turbo-like codes have eclipsed classical methods. These powerful error-correcting techniques achieve excellent error-rate performance that can closely approach Shannon's channel capacity limit. The lure of these large coding gains has resulted in their incorporation into a widening array of telecommunications standards and systems. This paper will briefly characterize turbo and turbo-like codes, examine their implications for physical layer system design, and discuss standards and systems where they are being used. The emphasis will be on telecommunications applications, particularly wireless, though others are mentioned. Some thoughts on the use of turbo and turbo-like codes in the future will also be given.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.895197","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4282113/04282124.pdf","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.895197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo and Turbo-Like Codes: Principles and Applications in Telecommunications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Turbo and Turbo-Like Codes: Principles and Applications in Telecommunications","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282124/","accessionNumber":"9629855","volume":"95","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo and Turbo-Like Codes: Principles and Applications in Telecommunications","sourcePdf":"95jproc06-gracie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1916S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4282113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4282113","articleId":"4282124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4282125,"authors":[{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4282113/4282125/4282125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lajos Hanzo received the five-year Dipl.Ing. degree in electronics in 1976 and the doctorate degree in 1983.

On the other hand, it shows the application of such techniques in a few simple cases, and evaluates improvement that can be obtained from them, especially in the low-SNR regime.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.896518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.896518","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4282113/04282126.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-Aided Turbo Synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Code-Aided Turbo Synchronization","volume":"95","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9629857","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Aided Turbo Synchronization","sourcePdf":"95jproc06-herzet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058416S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4282113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"82","articleId":"4282126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4282127,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Jaspar","affiliation":["Communication and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Jaspar","id":"37266457600"},{"name":"Christine Guillemot","affiliation":["IRISA/INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Guillemot","id":"37274492200"},{"name":"Luc Vandendorpe","affiliation":["Communication and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Vandendorpe","id":"37269898400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"4282127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Communication systems","Channel coding","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Cross layer design","Error probability","Delay","Turbo codes","Codecs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossy source codec","normal factor graphs","joint source-channel turbo coding","channel coders","channel coding separation","communication systems designing","discrete-valued sources","joint source-channel turbo techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel code","cross-layer design","iterative decoding","joint source\u2013channel code","source code","turbo principle"]}],"abstract":"The principles which have been prevailing so far for designing communication systems rely on Shannon's source and channel coding separation theorem. This theorem states that source and channel optimum performance bounds can be approached as close as desired by designing independently the source and channel coding strategies. However, this theorem holds only under asymptotic conditions, where both codes are allowed infinite length and complexity. If the design of the system is constrained in terms of delay and complexity, if the sources are not stationary, or if the channels are nonergodic, separate design and optimization of the source and channel coders can be largely suboptimal. For practical systems, joint source-channel (de)coding may reduce the end-to-end distortion. It is one of the aspects covered by the term cross-layer design, meaning a rethinking of the layer separation principle. This article focuses on recent developments of joint source-channel turbo coding and decoding techniques, which are described in the framework of normal factor graphs.

Though from a theoretical viewpoint the aliasing phenomenon is automatically handled by direct sampled-data control, such an approach cannot be used in conjunction with models derived through system identification. From a practical viewpoint, aliasing is often considered as an undesirable phenomenon and a typical remedy is the increase of the sampling frequency. However, the sampling frequency is upper bounded due to physical and economical constraints and aliasing may be inevitable. Control design for plants with aliased dynamics has not received explicit attention in the literature and it is not clear how to handle this situation. In this paper, it is shown that aliased resonance phenomena can effectively be suppressed in sampled-data feedback control design without the need for increasing the sampling frequency. Furthermore, it is shown experimentally on an industrial wafer stage that ignoring aliasing during control design can have a disastrous effect on closed-loop performance. Additionally, a novel, practically feasible procedure for identification of (possibly aliased) resonance phenomena based on multirate system theory is proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282145","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282145.pdf","startPage":"2881","endPage":"2886","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aliasing of Resonance Phenomena in Sampled-Data Feedback Control Design: Hazards, Modeling, and a Solution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Aliasing of Resonance Phenomena in Sampled-Data Feedback Control Design: Hazards, Modeling, and a Solution","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886159","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282145/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aliasing of Resonance Phenomena in Sampled-Data Feedback Control Design: Hazards, Modeling, and a Solution","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075469S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282153,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Seyr","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Mechatronics, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Seyr","id":"37830405100"},{"name":"Stefan Jakubek","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanics and Mechatronics, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Jakubek","id":"37333006200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4282153","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Path planning","Vehicle dynamics","Vehicles","Mechatronics","Space technology","Motion planning","Acceleration","Cities and towns","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","optimisation","path planning","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic trajectory generation","numerical multiobjective optimisation","boundary conditions","inequality constraints","map-building scheme","path planning","autonomous mobile robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic trajectory planning","multi-objective optimisation","nonlinear optimisation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282153","abstract":"An algorithm for dynamic trajectory generation employing numerical multi-objective optimisation is presented.

These graphs are obtained from finite number of degree balancing operations on Watts-Strogatz small-word networks that are irregular graphs. We show that quasi Ramanujan graphs share similar combinatorial optimality spectral properties as Ramanujan graphs and are not restricted to especial choices of degree and scale. A byproduct of this fact is that the algebraic connectivity ratio of quasi Ramanujan graphs grows exponentially in \ud835\udcc3 as well. Numerical experiments are performed to verify our analytical predictions.

It is shown that improvement of the quality of tracking by mobile sensors (or agents) leads to the emergence of flocking behavior. We discuss the benefits of a flocking-based mobility model for distributed Kalman filtering over mobile networks. This mobility model uses author's flocking algorithm with a natural choice of a moving rendezvous point that is the target itself. As the agents \"flock\" towards the target, the information value of their sensor measurements improves in time. During this process, smaller flocks merge and form larger flocks and eventually a single flock with a connected topology emerges. This allows the agents to perform cooperative filtering using the DKF algorithm which considerably improves their tracking performance. We show that this flocking algorithm is in fact an information-driven mobility that acts as a cooperative control strategy that enhances the aggregate information value of all sensor measurements. A metric for information value is given that has close connections to Fisher information. Simulation results are provided for a group of UAVs with embedded sensors tracking a mobile target using cooperative filtering.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282261","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282261.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282261","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","startPage":"4606","endPage":"4612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Tracking for Mobile Sensor Networks with Information-Driven Mobility","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Tracking for Mobile Sensor Networks with Information-Driven Mobility","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282261/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282261/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886273","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Tracking for Mobile Sensor Networks with Information-Driven Mobility","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055493S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4282265,"authors":[{"name":"Atalla F.

A dynamic mathematical modeling study was done to address the tasks of design, control and optimization of such facilities. The focus of this paper is on the three-phase separator, where each phase's dynamics are modeled. The hydrodynamics of liquid-liquid separation are modeled based on the American Petroleum Institute design criteria. Given some simplifying assumptions, the oil and gas phases' dynamic behaviors are modeled assuming vapor-liquid phase equilibrium at the oil surface. In order to validate the developed mathematical model, an oil production facility simulation was designed and implemented based on such models. The simulation model consists of a two-phase separator followed by a three-phase separator. An upset in the oil component of the incoming oil-well stream is introduced to analyze its effect of the different process variables and produced oil quality. The simulation results demonstrate the sophistication of the model in spite of its simplicity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282265/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9886277","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282265/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of Three-Phase Gravilty Separators in Oil Production Facilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of Three-Phase Gravilty Separators in Oil Production Facilities","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108547S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4282300,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Y.

Missions are constructed in real time from tasks such as patrolling an area or searching for an intruder, and may include constraints such as a restricted airspace.

First, a robust adaptive controller is proposed and proven to yield semi-global asymptotic tracking in the presence of additive disturbances and parametric uncertainty. In addition to guaranteeing an asymptotic output tracking result, it is also proven that the parameter estimate vector is driven to a constant vector. In the second part of the paper, a learning controller is designed and proven to yield a semi-global asymptotic tracking result in the presence of additive disturbances where the desired trajectory is periodic. A continuous nonlinear integral feedback component is utilized in the design of both controllers and Lyapunov-based techniques are used to guarantee that the tracking error is asymptotically driven to zero. Numerical simulation results are presented for both controllers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282419.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1202","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Control of Flat MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Additive Disturbance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Robust control","Programmable control","Uncertainty","Parameter estimation","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","continuous systems","control system synthesis","feedback","learning systems","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","robust control","tracking","uncertain systems","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flat MIMO nonlinear systems","robust adaptive controller","semi-global asymptotic tracking","additive disturbances","parametric uncertainty","asymptotic output tracking","parameter estimate vector","learning controller design","continuous nonlinear integral feedback component","Lyapunov-based techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control of Flat MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Additive Disturbance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282419/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886429","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control of Flat MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Additive Disturbance","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05022S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4282421,"authors":[{"name":"Lenaick Besnard","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Alabama Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Lenaick","lastName":"Besnard","id":"37942468900"},{"name":"Yuri B.

In this paper, we present an online identification method for such systems based on a generalized ADAptive LINear Element (ADALINE) neural network. It is well known ADALINE is slow in convergence which is not appropriate for online application and identification of time varying system. Two techniques are proposed to speed up convergence of learning, thus increase the capability of tracking time varying system parameters. One idea is to introduce a momentum term to the weight adjustment during convergence period. The other technique is to train the generalized ADALINE network multiple epochs with data from a sliding window of the system's input output data. Simulation results show that the proposed method provides a much faster convergence speed and better tracking of time varying parameters. The low computational complexity makes this method suitable for online system identification and real time adaptive control applications.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282423","startPage":"4792","endPage":"4797","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Identification Based on a Generalized ADALINE Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282423/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System Identification Based on a Generalized ADALINE Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282423/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9886433","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Identification Based on a Generalized ADALINE Neural Network","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041086S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4282443,"authors":[{"name":"Roel Merry","affiliation":["Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Merry","id":"37399871800"},{"name":"Rene van de Molengraft","affiliation":["Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Rene","lastName":"van de Molengraft","id":"37399869300"},{"name":"Maarten Steinbuch","affiliation":["Control Systems Technology group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maarten","lastName":"Steinbuch","id":"37272757200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4282443","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":657},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position measurement","Counting circuits","Sampling methods","Optical signal processing","Quantization","Polynomials","Signal processing","Velocity control","Switches","Motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","encoding","motion control","polynomials","position control","position measurement","quantisation (signal)","velocity control","velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error modeling","optical incremental encoders","time stamping","motion control systems","encoder position measurements","quantization errors","manufacturing tolerances","velocity estimations","low order polynomial fitting","active compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282443","abstract":"Optical incremental encoders are extensively used for position measurements in motion systems. The number of slits on the encoder disk defines the resolution of the encoder and bounds the accuracy of the position measurement. The encoder position measurements suffer from quantization errors. Moreover, encoder imperfections occur due to manufacturing tolerances. In this paper a method, which is based on time stamping, is proposed to obtain more accurate position and velocity estimations. Time stamping makes use of stored events, consisting of the encoder counts and their time instants, which are captured at a high resolution clock. Low order polynomial fitting through these encoder events is combined with active compensation of the encoder errors. The proposed method is applied in real-time experiments to a motion system. The results show an improvement in the position accuracy of up to 87% in terms of the maximum error. The estimated velocity is also much more accurate than the differentiated quantized encoder output signal.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282443","startPage":"3570","endPage":"3575","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282443.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error modeling and improved position estimation for optical incremental encoders by means of time stamping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Error modeling and improved position estimation for optical incremental encoders by means of time stamping","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282443/","accessionNumber":"9886453","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282443/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error modeling and improved position estimation for optical incremental encoders by means of time stamping","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07134S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4282447,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Simandl","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Simandl","id":"37072938900"},{"name":"Ondrej Straka","affiliation":["Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Straka","id":"37072895700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4282447","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Particle filters","State estimation","Proposals","Filtering","Time measurement","Cybernetics","Parameter estimation","Stochastic systems","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","nonlinear systems","particle filtering (numerical methods)","sampling methods","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filter","discrete-time nonlinear nonGaussian system state estimation","sampling density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear filtering","state estimation","particle filter","sampling density"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282447","abstract":"The paper deals with the particle filter in discrete-time nonlinear non-Gaussian system state estimation.

In this algorithm, the notion of species was introduced into population diversity measure. The species technique is based on the concept of dividing the population into several species according to their similarity. The inertia weight was nonlinearly adjusted by using population diversity information at each iteration step. Velocity mutation operator and position crossover operator were both introduced and the global performance was clearly improved. The algorithm had been applied to reactive power optimization. The simulation results of the standard IEEE-30-bus power system had indicated that APSO was able to undertake global search with a fast convergence rate and a feature of robust computation. It was proved to be validity, fast convergence and computation efficiency during the reactive power optimization.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282511","startPage":"4733","endPage":"4737","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282511.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Power System Reactive Power Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power systems","Reactive power","Convergence","Power system modeling","Control systems","Reactive power control","Fuzzy systems","Genetic mutations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","particle swarm optimisation","power systems","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive particle swarm optimization","power system reactive power optimization","population diversity measure","population diversity information","velocity mutation operator","position crossover operator","IEEE-30-bus power system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Power System Reactive Power Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282511/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886521","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Power System Reactive Power Optimization","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070479S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282520,"authors":[{"name":"Bernardo A.

The sliding mode observer works as an observer of the quadrotor velocities and estimator of the external disturbances such as wind and parameter uncertainties. The controller objective is to achieve good tracking of desired (x,y,z) absolute positions and yaw angle while keeping the stability of the pitch and roll angles, in spite of the presence of bounded external disturbances. For this reason, the observer-controller is proposed to estimate the effect of external perturbations in order to compensate them. The design methodology is based on Lyapunov stability. Simulation results show the good performances and the robustness of the proposed observer-controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Sliding mode control","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Helicopters","Pollution measurement","Rotors","Stability","Linear feedback control systems","Noise measurement","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","compensation","control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","mobile robots","observers","position control","remotely operated vehicles","robust control","tracking","uncertain systems","variable structure systems","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode observer","backstepping control","quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles","quadrotor velocities","external disturbances","wind","parameter uncertainties","absolute position tracking","yaw angle tracking","pitch stability","roll angles stability","external perturbation compensation","design methodology","Lyapunov stability","observer-controller robustness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282548","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282548","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282548","startPage":"5887","endPage":"5892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Mode Observer and Backstepping Control for a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sliding Mode Observer and Backstepping Control for a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282548/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282548/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886557","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding Mode Observer and Backstepping Control for a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074964S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4282556,"authors":[{"name":"DongBin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"DongBin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292971600"},{"name":"Timothy C.

An important observation is that, in contemporary communication networks, such as those employing Ethernet, data is sent in large packets. This motivates the development of networked control schemes where signal predictions are sent as packets. In the present work we present such a strategy. We focus on a configuration where the controller output is connected to the plant input via a network which we assume is prone to transmission errors. By using methods from predictive control theory, we show how closed loop stability can be ensured directly in the design.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282630.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1008","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packetized Predictive Control over Erasure Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Communication system control","Control systems","Delay effects","Communication networks","Ethernet networks","Stability","Protocols","Networked control systems","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control engineering computing","delays","distributed control","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packetized predictive control","erasure channels","digital networked control systems","time-delays","data-dropouts","quantization","closed loop stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Packetized Predictive Control over Erasure Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886638","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packetized Predictive Control over Erasure Channels","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073923S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282632,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

The control value is updated at each moment that an encoder pulse is detected, yielding zero measurement error. However, as the time between two control updates is varying now, conventional controller design methods do not apply as they normally assume a constant sample time. To deal with this problem, the controller design is performed by transforming the system equations from the time domain to the position (spatial) domain, in which the encoder pulses, and therefore the controller triggering, are equidistant. In this way, the control problem is rewritten as a synchronous problem for a non-linear plant. A gain scheduled controller is designed and analyzed in the spatial domain. This event-driven controller is experimentally validated on a prototype printer where a 1 pulse per revolution encoder is used to accurately control the motion of images through the printer.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282632","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282632.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282632","startPage":"2867","endPage":"2874","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and experimental validation of a sensor-based event-driven controller","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886640","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and experimental validation of a sensor-based event-driven controller","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055808S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4282649,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Li Liu","id":"37087170026"},{"name":"David A.

As an intelligent computational method based on stochastic search, PSO is shown to be a versatile and efficient tool for this complicated engineering problem. Through both simulation and experiment, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in identification of PMSM model parameters.

Currently, UAVs require human operators to control and direct their flights and sensors. To expand their effectiveness and exploit their inherent capabilities, we seek to develop robust techniques for multiple UAVs to cooperatively operate without direct human control. Our current research interest is to develop algorithms and simulate techniques to enable UAVs to search for, detect, and locate mobile ground targets emitting radio frequency signals. This paper investigates the task of combining sensor data from multiple UAVs to obtain accurate and reliable target locations. The sensors collect only coarse angle-of-arrival information and we apply Kalman filtering techniques to estimate the angle to the target. The estimated angles from multiple UAVs are sufficient to develop control laws for the UAVs to converge on an orbit about the target and collect additional measurements to further improve the estimation of the target's position. We explore a sensor fusion process embedded in a simple control law that allows multiple UAVs to cooperate in the target localization task and coordinate their motion using a leader-follower approach. We demonstrate the cooperative sensing techniques using simulation results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282657.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282657","startPage":"5928","endPage":"5933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localizing RF Targets with Cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282657/","displayDocTitle":"Localizing RF Targets with Cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/4282657/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9886665","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localizing RF Targets with Cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063255S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282659,"authors":[{"name":"Buzhou Wu","affiliation":["Control Systems Centre, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Buzhou","lastName":"Wu","id":"37652788200"},{"name":"Zhengtao Ding","affiliation":["Control Systems Centre, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Zhengtao","lastName":"Ding","id":"37291539100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4282659","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Nonlinear systems","Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Backstepping","Programmable control","Feedback","Stability","Adaptive systems","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled-data control scheme","adaptive control","nonlinear systems","parametric strict-feedback form","continuous-time adaptive controller design","sampling-hold device","forward Euler method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282659","abstract":"The paper considers sampled-data control for a class of nonlinear systems in parametric strict-feedback form.

Adaptive critic designs consist of two entities, an action network that produces optimal solution and a critic that evaluates the performance of the action network. The critic is termed adaptive as it adapts itself to output the optimal cost-to-go function and the action network is adapted simultaneously based on the information from the critic. In our online learning method, one NN is designated as the critic NN, which approximates the Bellman equation. An action NN is employed to derive the control signal to track a desired system trajectory while minimizing the cost function. Online updating weight tuning schemes for these two NNs are also derived and uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is shown. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated on a two-link robotic arm system.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282709","startPage":"4774","endPage":"4779","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282709.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Network Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-time Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Learning systems","Equations","Trajectory","Cost function","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","discrete time systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online reinforcement learning based neural network controller design","affine nonlinear discrete time systems","multiinput and multioutput systems","adaptive critic designs","optimal cost-to-go function","Bellman equation","system trajectory","online updating weight tuning schemes","uniformly ultimate boundedness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Online Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Network Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-time Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282709/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886715","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Network Controller Design for Affine Nonlinear Discrete-time Systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072447S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282751,"authors":[{"name":"Srdjan S.

A number of examples illustrate efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282751","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","startPage":"2744","endPage":"2749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Based Overlapping Decentralized Estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Based Overlapping Decentralized Estimator","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282751/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9902098","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282751/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Based Overlapping Decentralized Estimator","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080223S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282753,"authors":[{"name":"Afshin Izadian","affiliation":["Department of CSEE, West Virginia University, USA"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Izadian","id":"38505545300"},{"name":"Lawrence A.

However, manufacturing imperfections and sometimes faulty conditions make the device operate asymmetrically which cause the rotational movement, orthogonal to the conventional direction of movement and put the device in unstable region of operation. In this case, the rotated lateral moving plate experiences an extra force generated which pulls the device into the region of instability. This paper illustrates the application of variable structure controllers to correct such behavior and to compensate the uncertainties exist in the microsystem parameters. The controller is composed of a self-tuning parameter estimation block and is designed to control Lateral Comb Resonators under healthy and faulty conditions. The controller utilizes through wafer optical monitoring techniques to provide position feedback signal. The controller is implemented in the real-time control board and is experimentally tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control under different operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282753/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886757","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory Control of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Under Faulty Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory Control of MEMS Lateral Comb Resonators Under Faulty Conditions","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076109S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282760,"authors":[{"name":"Sathyendra Ghantasala","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sathyendra","lastName":"Ghantasala","id":"38272201000"},{"name":"Nael H.

Using a finite-dimensional system that captures the PDE's dominant dynamic modes, a family of nonlinear feedback controllers with well-characterized constrained stability regions are initially designed. Then, following a coordinate transformation that diagonalizes the input operator of the finite-dimensional system, a set of dedicated FDI filters - each replicating the fault-free behavior of a given state of the transformed system - are constructed. The choice of actuator locations ensures that each filter's residual is sensitive to faults in only one actuator and decoupled from the rest. Following FDI, a set of actuator reconfiguration laws are derived to preserve closed-loop stability and minimize performance deterioration. Finally, the FDI-FTC architecture is implemented on the infinite-dimensional system, and appropriate FDI thresholds and actuator reconfiguration criteria are established to provide the necessary robustness against model reduction errors. Using singular perturbation techniques, these criteria are tied to the two time-scale separation between the slow and fast eigenvalues of the differential operator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Fault Isolation and Reconfigurable Control of Transport-Reaction Processes with Actuator Faults","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282760","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282760.pdf","startPage":"2066","endPage":"2071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Fault Isolation and Reconfigurable Control of Transport-Reaction Processes with Actuator Faults","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282760/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886764","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Fault Isolation and Reconfigurable Control of Transport-Reaction Processes with Actuator Faults","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112339S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282777,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenzhen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenzhen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37691264800"},{"name":"Itamar Elhanany","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Itamar","lastName":"Elhanany","id":"37323766700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4282777","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282777","abstract":"This paper presents an efficient and scalable online learning algorithm for recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

This result is useful for implementing vehicle formation control because it provides a guideline for the proper intervehicle spacing. In the heterogeneous case, the differing dynamics of the vehicles means the spacing errors do not attenuate or amplify uniformly down the vehicle chain, regardless of whether the formation is string stable or not. Questions arise regarding how heterogeneous string stability should be defined, and what should the proper intervehicle spacing be in order to guarantee nominal safety. In this paper, heterogeneous vehicle strings under simple decentralized control laws with the constant spacing control policy are analyzed. A definition for heterogeneous string stability is proposed. The necessary and sufficient conditions for heterogeneous string stability are given for the constant spacing leader-predecessor following control strategy. The scalability of the control scheme is verified by analyzing the worst case disturbance to error gain. It is shown that string stability can be achieved for heterogeneous vehicle strings of arbitrary length and arbitrary vehicle type ordering.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4282789","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04282789.pdf","startPage":"3118","endPage":"3125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4282789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"String Stability Analysis for Heterogeneous Vehicle Strings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4282789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282789/","displayDocTitle":"String Stability Analysis for Heterogeneous Vehicle Strings","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886793","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4282789/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"String Stability Analysis for Heterogeneous Vehicle Strings","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054661S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4282813,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano A.

In a dynamic environment, path planning for UAVs is often based on predicted obstacle and target motion. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is first used to estimate the states of a moving object detected by a UAV from its measured position in space. The optimal object trajectory is then predicted from the estimated object states and using the motion model defined for Kalman filtering. Finally, the quality of the predicted trajectory is evaluated by computing the variance of the prediction error.

A model-based adaptive loop is added to a LTI stabilizing controller to minimize the position control error of the HDD head. This adaptive loop may be used in either of two modes: control tuning (CT) or real-time fully adaptive control (RTFAC). The former (CT) consists of adapting a FIR filter to compensate for unknown disturbance dynamics using the inverse QR-RLS algorithm. Once the filter has converged it is wrapped into the LTI controller and a new tuning process is performed, iteratively improving the control performance. The second method (RTFAC) consists of adapting indefinitely a FIR filter to compensate for unknown disturbances. This method is implemented using an unwindowed lattice RLS filter, which makes the scheme converge substantially faster than when using other adaptive algorithms. This pertains to the HDD data seek time. Another innovation in this paper is the introduction of a frequency-weighting filter in the RTFAC scheme, which accounts for robust stability. Experimental results are presented for both adaptive tuning and control methods, programmed on a commercial hard disk drive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282928/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886929","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Tuning and Control of a Hard Disk Drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Tuning and Control of a Hard Disk Drive","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050929S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4282941,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Ma","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Ma","id":"37536694100"},{"name":"Chengyu Cao","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Chengyu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37287632200"},{"name":"Naira Hovakimyan","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Naira","lastName":"Hovakimyan","id":"37299175600"},{"name":"Warren E.

Output oscillations need to be minimized in scanning operations of systems such as the piezo actuator and the flexible structure, while modeling errors widely exists in practical applications. The proposed approach extends the developed optimal scan trajectory design and control method, by introducing the design of a prefilter into the framework to reduce the output oscillations. Furthermore, a novel inversion-based iterative control algorithm is proposed and integrated with the optimal scan method to compensate for the modeling error effect on the scanning. The convergence of the iterative control law is discussed, and the convergence range is quantified. The proposed approach is illustrated by implementing it on the high-speed adhesion force measurement using AFM. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4282976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4282976/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9886976","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Iteration-based Scan-Trajectory Design and Control with Output-Oscillation Minimization: Atomic Force Microscope Example","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iteration-based Scan-Trajectory Design and Control with Output-Oscillation Minimization: Atomic Force Microscope Example","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046424S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4282976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4282978,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37574765000"},{"name":"J.

This can be avoided if sufficiently strong coupling with the leader is employed. If instead each vehicle tracks the average distance form its neighbours, the interconnection can still be ill-conditioned in the sense that the response to disturbances is not uniformly bounded with the size of the platoon. We show in the paper that in a symmetric bidirectional scheme, arbitrarily weak coupling with the leader can make the platoon scalable. In addition, we show that despite the additional feedback in a bidirectional control law, the symmetry of the information flow enables the derivation of local conditions which, if satisfied, guarantee that an arbitrarily long heterogeneous interconnection is robustly stable.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4283022","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04283022.pdf","startPage":"4678","endPage":"4683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4283022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability in heterogeneous vehicle platoons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4283022/","displayDocTitle":"Scalability in heterogeneous vehicle platoons","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9887013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4283022/","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability in heterogeneous vehicle platoons","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06587S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4283022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4283055,"authors":[{"name":"Xuemei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37271421800"},{"name":"A B Rad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"A B","lastName":"Rad","id":"37267309800"},{"name":"Frank L Lewis","affiliation":["Automation and Robotics Research Institute, University of Texas, Arlington, Fort Worth, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Frank L","lastName":"Lewis","id":"37284885700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0988-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0989-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-5861"}],"articleNumber":"4283055","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283055","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Neural networks","Robot control","Adaptive control","Trajectory","PD control","Error correction","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Torque control","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","compensation","feedback","manipulator dynamics","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","PD control","robust control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based compensation control","robot manipulators","unknown dynamics","trajectory tracking","PD feedback controller","nonlinear feedback controller","input modification","feedforward compensation","slide mode control","asymptotic stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4283055","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04283055.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4283055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network-Based Compensation Control of Robot Manipulators with Unknown Dynamics","abstract":"A neural network (NN)-based compensation control is proposed for the trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators with unknown dynamics. This compensation controller includes a PD feedback controller, a nonlinear feedback controller and a neural network compensator with input modification. The PD controller and the nonlinear feedback controller are used to ensure the stability of the robot system, while the neural network is employed to provide the required feedforward compensation input torque for the trajectory tracking. The inputs of the neural network are modified by the reference tracking error and the network derivatives in order to further improve the control performance. The theoretical result concerning the tracking error asymptotically convergent to a neighborhood of zero is given. In addition, a NN-based robust compensation controller is proposed, using a slide mode control in the control law, which leads to asymptotic stability of the tracking errors.

Due to their mechanical construction, they have a relatively low-frequency first resonant mode. This mode gets excited due to environmental noise and introduces errors in the scan obtained. In precision scanning applications, this limits the upper bound of a triangular scan rate to around 1/100th the first mechanical resonance frequency. Feedback control techniques and shunt damping methods have shown promising results in damping this resonant mode and improving scan performance. Most of these techniques need a sensor, which in turn adds complexity to the overall system. With this motivation, passive sensorless shunt damping has been investigated and documented. In this work, we design active sensorless shunts, optimized using H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n and Hinfin techniques.

A multi-vehicle test is also presented to demonstrate non-communicating de-confliction trajectory planning using MILP.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4282134/4282135/04283101.pdf","startPage":"5322","endPage":"5327","publicationTitle":"2007 American Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/ACC.2007.4283101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2007.4283101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Flight Experiments Using On-Line Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Trajectory Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Testing","Trajectory","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Computational complexity","Aerospace simulation","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Cities and towns","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft testing","integer programming","interpolation","linear programming","path planning","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional flight testing","online mixed-integer linear programming trajectory optimization","online path planner formulation","receding horizon minimization problem","unmanned aerial vehicle","linear interpolation point","multivehicle test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4283101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Flight Experiments Using On-Line Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Trajectory Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4283101/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9946411","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"9-13 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Flight Experiments Using On-Line Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Trajectory Optimization","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"ACC-00-966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062809S","chronDate":"9-13 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4282134","isNumber":"4282135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4282134","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4282135","articleId":"4283101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4283234,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Wong Choi","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gil Wong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37532124300"},{"name":"Jin Joo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Joo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280084700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0633-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4283234","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Voltage control","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Solid state circuits","Microwave amplifiers","Reliability engineering","Power engineering and energy","Multichip modules","High power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","intermodulation distortion","travelling wave tubes","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid state amplifier","bias voltage control","bias control linearized traveling wave tube","intermodulation distortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283234","abstract":"In this paper, the authors proposed a bias control linearized traveling wave tube (BCLTWT) to improve the linearity of the MPM.

For batteries in cycling duty, Li-ion and Ni-MH cells are coming into wide use to displace VRLA batteries. For float duty, VRLA and NiCd batteries predominate. Flywheel-generator units are being offered to replace batteries in UPS. Fuel cells require a warm-up time and, hence, are suitable for long-term operation. Ultracapacitors are proposed to replace batteries for short-term discharge.

It is based on a novel concept that employs four transistors as current switch to select different differential pairs as input pairs for different common-mode voltage. The operation of the two differential pairs is separated, so they can be regulated for constant Gm for the whole input common-mode voltage range. An OTA stage is used at the output for better frequency response and precisely controlling of output current. There is no requirement for any precise analytic relationship between drain current and transconductance, this is particularly important as it makes the circuit useful for deep submicron CMOS technologies. And it can work for supply power of 2.5V~5.5V. With GSMC 0.18um CMOS process, the simulation results show that the gain can achieve 80 dB.

Considering the relevance of the data used in the process of RunBefore's decoding, arithmetic operation is combined with FSM, which achieves higher decoding efficiency. The simulation result shows that the decoder can decode the coded stream of transform coefficients in each block. Moreover, it can decode every syntax element in one clock cycle. When the proposed design is synthesized at clock constraint of 100 MHz, the synthesis result shows that the design costs 9600 cells under a 0.25 mum CMOS technology, which meets the demand of real time decoding in H.264/AVC standard.","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Density packaging and Microsystem Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Density packaging and Microsystem Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/4283545/4283546/04283628.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HDP.2007.4283628","doi":"10.1109/HDP.2007.4283628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of CAVLC Decoder for H.264/AVC Video Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of CAVLC Decoder for H.264/AVC Video Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4283628/","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4283628/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300600","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of CAVLC Decoder for H.264/AVC Video Decoding","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"HDP-00-82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039012S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4283545","isNumber":"4283546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4283545","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4283546","articleId":"4283628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4283630,"authors":[{"name":"Zhai Haihua","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education & Microelectronic Research and Development Center, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhai","lastName":"Haihua","id":"37937807100"},{"name":"Xi Zhiqi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education & Microelectronic Research and Development Center, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Zhiqi","id":"37937806700"},{"name":"Chen Guanghua","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education & Microelectronic Research and Development Center, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guanghua","id":"37299228400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1252-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1253-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4283630","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"abstract":"The design of H.264/AVC interpolation unit is very challenging for the high memory bandwidth and large calculation complexity caused by the new coding features of variable block size (VBS) and 6-tap filter. In this paper, a novel one-step interpolation implementation algorithm is proposed which can effectively reduce processing cycle because of its less memory accessing. Moreover, a data reuse scheme is used to save processing cycle and memory bandwidth. A high performance hardware architecture is implemented according to the methods mentioned above. As a result, 26% memory bandwidth reduction and 45% processing cycle reduction are achieved, which shows that our architecture is an efficient hardware accelerating solution and can be used in real-time encoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Density packaging and Microsystem Integration","pdfPath":"/iel5/4283545/4283546/04283630.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on High Density packaging and Microsystem Integration","doi":"10.1109/HDP.2007.4283630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HDP.2007.4283630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4283546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Implementation of Sub-pixel Interpolator for H.264/AVC Encoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Automatic voltage control","Interpolation","Bandwidth","Filters","Hardware","High definition video","Computer architecture","Laboratories","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","integrated circuit design","interpolation","microprocessor chips","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","sub-pixel interpolator","H.264-AVC encoder","coding features","variable block size","one-step interpolation implementation algorithm","data reuse scheme","high performance hardware architecture","hardware accelerating solution","real-time encoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264/AVC","one-step interpolation","data reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4283630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Implementation of Sub-pixel Interpolator for H.264/AVC Encoder","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4283630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"10300602","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"26-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Implementation of Sub-pixel Interpolator for H.264/AVC Encoder","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"HDP-00-84.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047093S","chronDate":"26-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4283545","isNumber":"4283546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4283545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4283546","articleId":"4283630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4283635,"authors":[{"name":"Yueli Hu","affiliation":["Microelectronic Research & Development Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yueli","lastName":"Hu","id":"37535759300"},{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["Microelectronic Research & Development Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37933980100"},{"name":"Wenyi Jing","affiliation":["Microelectronic Research & Development Center, Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenyi","lastName":"Jing","id":"37870264700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1252-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1253-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4283635","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Hardware","Machine vision","Image processing","Computer architecture","Process control","Costs","Registers","Microelectronics","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","computer vision","integrated circuit design","integrated memory circuits","logic design","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric single-chip multiprocessor architecture design","subprocessors","shared data memory interrupt","command transfer","data exchange","arbiter judgment scheme","effective interrupt access mechanism","machine vision system","image processing arithmetic computation","instruction-level-parallel scheme","single-threading architecture","on-chip arbiter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4283635","abstract":"In the machine vision system, a common and effective way to solve high complexity and huge throughput of image processing arithmetic computation is to adopt instruction-level-parallel scheme through multiple MCUs with the single-threading architecture.

First, correlation between reflectance, derivative reflectance against soybean LAI were conducted; secondly, five vegetation indices with reflectance at band 801nm and 670nm were applied to regresses against soybean LAI; finally, ANN-BP established for soybean LAI estimation with changeable nodes in hidden layers. It were found that soybean canopy reflectance show a negative correlation with soybean LAI, while it show a positive correlation with soybean LAI in near infrared region. Reflectance derivative have an intimate relation with soybean LAI in blue, green and red edge spectral region, and got maximum correlation coefficient in red edge region.

Low population rate and short generation cycle are the main benefits of vibrational genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284058/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9809785","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284058/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"14-16 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vibrational Genetic Algorithm Based Path Planner for Autonomous UAV in Spatial Data Based Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vibrational Genetic Algorithm Based Path Planner for Autonomous UAV in Spatial Data Based Environments","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"RAST-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046045S","chronDate":"14-16 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4283955","isNumber":"4283956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4283955","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4283956","articleId":"4284058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4284088,"authors":[{"name":"Can Kurtulus","affiliation":["Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Kurtulus","id":"37891568800"},{"name":"Taskin Baltaci","affiliation":["Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taskin","lastName":"Baltaci","id":"37937624600"},{"name":"Murat Ulusoy","affiliation":["Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Ulusoy","id":"37088819239"},{"name":"B.

We consider the problem of estimating the arrival times of overlapping ocean-acoustic signals from a noisy received waveform that consists of attenuated and delayed replicas of a known transient signal. We assume that the transmitted signal and the number of paths in the multipath environment are known. Many existing time-delay estimation algorithms perform poorly due to converging to local optimum points. In this paper, an efficient genetic-algorithm (GA) is applied to deal with the above problem. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to solve time delay estimation (TDE) using an evolutionary technique, genetic-algorithms. The performance of generic-algorithm is examined for different signal-noise scenarios. Our simulation results show that the time delays are estimated well based on the genetic-algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284127","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284127.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Multi-path Time Delay Estimation Problem in the Presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise Using a Genetic-Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Delay estimation","Additive white noise","Signal processing algorithms","Sonar","Genetics","Propagation delay","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","delays","genetic algorithms","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-path time delay estimation problem","additive white Gaussian noise","genetic-algorithm","ocean-acoustic signals","transient signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multipath","least-squares","Genetic-Algorithm","time delay estimation","maximum-likelihood estimator Introduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Solving Multi-path Time Delay Estimation Problem in the Presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise Using a Genetic-Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9793855","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Multi-path Time Delay Estimation Problem in the Presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise Using a Genetic-Algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038901S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284119","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","xplore-issue":"4284120","articleId":"4284127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4284128,"authors":[{"name":"Preetam Kumar","affiliation":["GSSST, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37382692600"},{"name":"M.

However, the spectrum continues to be scarce and expensive, which creates new challenges in the developments of telecommunications systems. Wireless cellular systems are known to suffer from fading and intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation, which may degrade the system performance significantly. Therefore, the effective and efficient interference mitigation is required for a high quality signal reception. The air interface of the third generation mobile radio systems UMTS (Universal Mobile telecommunications system) is based on wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA). Third generation wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) has employed transmit diversity. In the paper, we have considered a WCDMA downlink channel in which transmitted signal is spread by orthogonal codes. Orthogonality in WCDMA is destroyed because of frequency selective fading. This causes multiple access interference (MAI). A RAKE receiver does not restore the orthogonality. As a powerful receiver algorithms, we investigate a MMSE DFE with Alamouti transmit diversity scheme to suppress the MAI and restore the orthogonality condition. Simulation results show significant performance improvement over an adaptive linear equalizer (LE) and a RAKE receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of Multiple Access Interference (MAI) in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284174","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284174.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of Multiple Access Interference (MAI) in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284174/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9801416","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of Multiple Access Interference (MAI) in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04278S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284119","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","xplore-issue":"4284120","articleId":"4284174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4284176,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Optimum detection for CDMA based systems, including STBC MC-CDMA, using conventional MUD has a high computational complexity. For K number of users for instance, the computational complexity grows exponentially with K. Although suboptimum detection methods with less complexity are available, they are less powerful than MUD. To achieve the optimality of MUD while avoiding the computational complexity, we propose the use of binary genetic algorithm in the detector. For the evaluation, we simulated STBC MC-CDMA system over a frequency selective rayleigh fading channel. The receiver employs the binary genetic algorithm assisted MUD. For the purpose of comparison, STBC MC-CDMA receiver using equal gain combining (EGC) was simulated as well. The simulation result shows that the system under investigation performed better than STBC MC-CDMA using EGC.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284176","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284176.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Genetic Algorithm Assisted Multiuser Detector for STBC MC-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Binary Genetic Algorithm Assisted Multiuser Detector for STBC MC-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284176/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9793884","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4284176/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Genetic Algorithm Assisted Multiuser Detector for STBC MC-CDMA","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068038S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284119","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4284120","articleId":"4284176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4284177,"authors":[{"name":"Sofia N.

Having bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, lxEV-DO could support data rate of up to 2.4576 Mbps in forward link. Multimedia data transmission through CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO network is prone to errors. Therefore, rate control system is necessary in order to manage data rate according to channel condition in multimedia data transmission. One of the methods used to achieve maximum data rate in forward link is scheduling mechanism. Scheduler is utilized to optimize and increase efficiency in system resource sharing process, where bandwidth is varying constantly in accordance to wireless channel fluctuation. In this research, to gain maximum data rate, a wireless system with proportional fair scheduler scenario is employed. PF scheduler algorithm is a scheduling mechanism that endeavors to raise system throughput performance by scheduling data transmission to users when their channels are optimized. On the other hand, open loop rate control is used to adaptively adjust the data rate to channel condition. Simulation results show that in vehicular type, scheduling mechanism using PF scheduler could improve system throughput. Throughput acquired by PF scheduler is 2.11 Mbps, while FIFO scheduler is merely 830 kbps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PF Scheduler Algorithm and Open Loop Rate Control For Performance Improvement of CDMA 2000 1xEV-DO Network","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284177","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284177.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"PF Scheduler Algorithm and Open Loop Rate Control For Performance Improvement of CDMA 2000 1xEV-DO Network","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284177/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9801418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PF Scheduler Algorithm and Open Loop Rate Control For Performance Improvement of CDMA 2000 1xEV-DO Network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055884S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284119","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","xplore-issue":"4284120","articleId":"4284177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4284180,"authors":[{"name":"Ghafour Amouzad Mahdiraji","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ghafour Amouzad","lastName":"Mahdiraji","id":"37395393400"},{"name":"Mohamad Khazani Abdullah","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamad Khazani","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"37272078000"},{"name":"Mohamed Faisal Elhag","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamed Faisal","lastName":"Elhag","id":"37939472400"},{"name":"Ahmed Fauzi Abas","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Fauzi","lastName":"Abas","id":"37268696200"},{"name":"Edmond Zahedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic & System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Edmond","lastName":"Zahedi","id":"37284017000"},{"name":"Makhfudzah Mokhtar","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Systems Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Makhfudzah","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"37605853300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1004-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1005-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"4284180","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"A new multiplexing technique which is called duty cycle division multiplexing (DCDM) is presented in this paper.

Presently, modification of loading algorithm is reported with observed decrease in computational complexity without any loss of performance as compared to the known algorithm. The study was carried out for mobile communication systems considering the channel to be frequency selective and fast fading.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284197","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284197.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive OFDM over Frequency Selective and Fast Fading Channel using Blockwise Bit Loading Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284197/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive OFDM over Frequency Selective and Fast Fading Channel using Blockwise Bit Loading Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9801363","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284197/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive OFDM over Frequency Selective and Fast Fading Channel using Blockwise Bit Loading Algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025978S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4284197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4284199,"authors":[{"name":"Zaheer Khan","affiliation":["University College of Boras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zaheer","lastName":"Khan","id":"37942489000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1004-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1005-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"4284199","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Delay","Multiple access interference","AWGN","Performance analysis","Fading","Quadrature phase shift keying","Educational institutions","Autocorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","code division multiple access","correlation methods","error statistics","Hadamard transforms","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink quasi-synchronous CDMA system","CDMA","code division multiple access","orthogonal polyphase sequences","bit error rate","AWGN","additive white Gussian channel","flat Rayleigh fading channels","correlation functions","LS-UCHT","loosely synchronized-UCHT","unified complex Hadamard transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","interference free window (IFW)","loosely synchronized codes (LS-codes)","loosely synchronized-UCHT (LS-UCHT)","modified UCHT","multiple access interference (MAI)","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)","unified complex Hadamard transform (UCHT)","zero correlation zone (ZCZ)"]}],"abstract":"The bit error rate (BER) performance for uplink quasi-synchronous code division multiple access system using different sets of orthogonal polyphase sequences is analyzed in this paper.

Therefore, a modified constant modulus algorithm was developed for blind channel equalization.

To work around potentially computational intractability, the proposed scheme exploits heuristics in consideration of both global and local exploration CMA.

This is due to the fact that a MIMO channel can offer a capacity gain over a traditional single-input single-output (SISO) channel. These spectral efficiency gains often require accurate knowledge of the channel at the receiver, and some times at the transmitter as well. In this paper, we present the concept and discuss some ongoing research directions on the channel capacity of a MIMO wireless system. Preliminary simulations show linear increasing results in spectral efficiency of MIMO with an arbitrary number of transmit or receive antennas.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284212","publicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IFIP International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284119/4284120/04284212.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on the Channel Capacity of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Wireless System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284212/","displayDocTitle":"A Study on the Channel Capacity of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Wireless System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9793864","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284212/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on the Channel Capacity of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Wireless System","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"WOCN-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053711S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284119","isNumber":"4284120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284119","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4284120","articleId":"4284212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4284213,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Luo","id":"37690976700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1004-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1005-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"}],"articleNumber":"4284213","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Viterbi algorithm","Iterative decoding","Energy consumption","Modems","Digital communication","AWGN channels","Computational modeling","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo code decoding","soft-output Viterbi algorithm","survivor memory unit","trace back unit"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an improved Viterbi algorithm (VA) and its application in soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) for turbo code decoding.

The basic idea is to keep the operations of VNA/mixers linear, diverting to them only a small portion of the signal present at the device under test (DUT) ports, therefore keeping unaltered the VNA capabilities already exhibited for small signal measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave Measurements Part II Non-linear Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MIM.2007.4284255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289/4284239/04284255.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIM.2007.4284255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Microwave Measurements Part II Non-linear Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4284255/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9612648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave Measurements Part II Non-linear Measurements","sourcePdf":"34-39-iamm-10-03-02.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068673S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5289","isNumber":"4284239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5289","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4284239","articleId":"4284255","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4284574,"authors":[{"name":"Shuiming Ye","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuiming","lastName":"Ye","id":"37416268000"},{"name":"Qibin Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qibin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37272159600"},{"name":"Ee-Chien Chang","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ee-Chien","lastName":"Chang","id":"37274693600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284574","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital images","Forgery","Image processing","Transform coding","Image coding","Authentication","Power measurement","Quantization","Discrete cosine transforms","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital image forgeries detection","blocking artifact","JPEG compression","natural authentication code","quantization table estimation","power spectrum","DCT coefficient histogram"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284574","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284574","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","abstract":"Digital images can be forged easily with today's widely available image processing software.

To improve the applicability of the method as a forensic tool, we propose an enhancement over it by also verifying that class properties of the image in question are in agreement with those of the camera. For this purpose, we identify and compare characteristics due to demosaicing operation.

The proposed framework significantly improves the video transmission quality with little extra computational complexity and system overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Video Transmission for OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284748","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284748.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Video Transmission for OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284748/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804386","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Video Transmission for OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043518S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4284753,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Yang Lin","affiliation":["Department of CSIE, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Yang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37420979700"},{"name":"Kin-Chung Wong","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Kin-Chung","lastName":"Wong","id":"38253839600"},{"name":"Nigel Boston","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Nigel","lastName":"Boston","id":"37371000700"},{"name":"Yu Hen Hu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Yu Hen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277445900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284753","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Nose","Technological innovation","Lighting","Deformable models","Linear discriminant analysis","Feature extraction","Facial features","Councils","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","facial expression variation","similarity metrics fusion","feature extraction","fusion-based face recognition algorithm","summation invariant features"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel 3D face recognition method that incorporates summation invariant features extracted from multiple sub-regions of a facial range images, and optimal fusion of similarity scores between corresponding sub-regions.

In this paper, a texture based selective boundary matching algorithm (TSBMA) is proposed to conceal erroneous macro-blocks (EMBs). Different from the conventional boundary matching algorithms which are carried out progressively in the raster scan mode, the processing order of the TSBMA for an EMB in a connected EMBs region is determined by the texture intensity information of its neighboring blocks, which are correct or recovered. The EMB with maximum texture intensity in its neighbors are firstly recovered. It is likely that the EMB which has more corrected MBs in its neighbors with stronger texture intensity has higher possibility to be recovered accurately, which will provide valuable information to recover the left EMBs in its neighbors. Thus, the proposed TSBMA can avoid the dependent recovery problem in the conventional BMAs. Moreover, the influence of boundary width and confidences of boundaries on the recovery results are discussed. Comparison results with different error concealment methods on several video sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed TSBMA.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284756","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","startPage":"739","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture Based Selective Block Matching Algorithm for Error Concealment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Texture Based Selective Block Matching Algorithm for Error Concealment","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284756/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804393","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4284756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture Based Selective Block Matching Algorithm for Error Concealment","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054233S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4284760,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Ta Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ta","lastName":"Lee","id":"37278521700"},{"name":"Hsin-Jung Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Jung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37935587300"},{"name":"Yuh-Shyan Hwang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Shyan","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37275285800"},{"name":"Jiann-Jong Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jiann-Jong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284760","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"The latest video compression standard H.264 is an efficient coding technique for video applications. However, H.264 video streams are sensitive to errors which occur in the transmission of data over noisy channels. In this paper, a new error concealment technique is proposed to provide error resilience based on the source decoder of H.264 and the channel decoder of LDPC. The proposed method employs the fuzzy adaptive scheme to improve the error correction capability which utilizes the extrinsic information from the channel decoder to update the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) after each iteration.

It is of great interest for the multimedia research community to find methods and solutions that could help bridge the semantic gap that exists between the low-level features extracted from the audio or video data and the actual semantics of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that works towards reducing this semantic gap. The proposed framework uses the a priori algorithm and association rule mining to find frequent itemsets in the feature data set and generate classification rules to classify video shots to different concepts (semantics). We also introduce a novel pre-filtering architecture which reduces the high positive to negative instances ratio in the classifier training step. This helps reduce the amount of misclassification errors. Our proposed framework shows promising results in classifying multiple concepts.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284786","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284786.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Semantic Concept Discovery using Multimodal-Based Association Classification","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284786/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804418","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284786/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Semantic Concept Discovery using Multimodal-Based Association Classification","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035605S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4284818,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kuei Hsieh","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Kuei","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37556438500"},{"name":"Yung-Chang Chen","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Chang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281028000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face detection","Image reconstruction","Linear discriminant analysis","Kernel","Linear regression","Principal component analysis","Space technology","Vectors","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image reconstruction","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel-based pose invariant face recognition","virtual frontal view","virtual face","3D model reconstruction","virtual image","nonlinear pose normalization problem","kernel function nonlinearity","local linear regression method","CMU PIE database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pose normalization","kernel nonlinear mapping","linear regression"]}],"abstract":"The performance of a face recognition system degrades incredibly due to the variation of facial appearance with different pose, which is well known as one of the bottlenecks in face recognition.

Simulation results demonstrate that the DCPR protocol can effectively enhance the reliability of wireless broadcast services with a repair latency comparable to that of optimal scheduling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284840.pdf","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1078","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Peer-to-Peer Repair for Wireless Multimedia Broadcast","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia communication","Optimal scheduling","Delay","Forward error correction","Wireless LAN","Processor scheduling","Network topology","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadcasting","computer network reliability","multimedia communication","peer-to-peer computing","protocols","scheduling","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative peer-to-peer repair","wireless multimedia broadcast reliability","IEEE802.11-based CPR","global state information","CPR transmission optimal scheduling","distributed CPR protocol","DCPR protocol","WLAN","3G broadcasting losses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Peer-to-Peer Repair for Wireless Multimedia Broadcast","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804465","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Peer-to-Peer Repair for Wireless Multimedia Broadcast","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081641S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4284843,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhou","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37288677400"},{"name":"Shuicheng Yan","affiliation":["Beckman Institute, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shuicheng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37272225300"},{"name":"Thomas S.

In this paper, we study the problem of detecting anomalous events by analyzing the motion trajectories in videos. Different trajectories of the same category may have varying relative velocities, in addition to the variations and noises in location samples; hence the core of the problem is to provide a robust and accurate function for measuring the similarities of trajectory pairs. We propose a novel learning based algorithm for estimating the similarities of the multi-dimensional sequence pairs, and then an anomaly detection framework is presented to detect anomalous motion trajectories in surveillance videos. Our proposed algorithm offers several advantages over the traditional algorithms for dealing with the trajectories of moving objects. First, the similarity measurement is robust against data imperfections such as noise, algorithmic error and etc. Second, we introduce a learning algorithm which allows the similarity function to be adapted to the particular problems being solved. Third, the proposed anomaly detection framework is fully automatic and without parametric distribution assumption on the data. The experiments on both outdoor and indoor surveillance videos validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in detecting anomalous trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284843","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284843.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Anomaly in Videos from Trajectory Similarity Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284843/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Anomaly in Videos from Trajectory Similarity Analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284843/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Anomaly in Videos from Trajectory Similarity Analysis","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057917S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4284875,"authors":[{"name":"Daewon Song","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Daewon","lastName":"Song","id":"37289776100"},{"name":"Chang Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Chang Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284875","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Time-varying channels","Channel capacity","Video compression","Throughput","Bit error rate","Time varying systems","State estimation","Channel state information","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","mobile radio","quality of service","radio receivers","time-varying channels","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS","scalable video transmission","MIMO systems","time-varying channel capacity","multi-input multi-output wireless systems","BER","MIMO channel","channel state information","optimal power allocation","power allocation","water-filling","data rate maximizing power reallocation","scalable video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SVC","SVD-MIMO","QoS","adaptive modulation","channel selection","power reallocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel QoS guaranteed scalable video transmission scheme over multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless systems. The proposed scheme is able to not only guarantee the QoS (required BER for base and enhancement layer in compressed video) and but also maximize the system throughput over time-varying MIMO channel. We assume that the estimated channel state information (CSI) at the receiver is available at the transmitter through feedback. In this scenario, under a transmit power constraint, optimal power allocation can be designed to satisfy QoS-guaranteed maximum throughput by a combination of several adaptive operations. These operations include channel adaptive sub-channel selection, power allocation based on water-filling (WF), and data rate maximizing power reallocation. The proposed power reallocation scheme enables us to obtain surplus power after selecting proper adaptive mode and reallocate to other subchannels so as to maximize the data rate. We present in this paper some detailed analysis as well as simulation results to demonstrate that QoS guaranteed video transmission over MIMO wireless systems can indeed be achieved based on scalable video coding and a sequence of adaptive operations.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284875","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284875.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS Guaranteed Scalable Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems with Time-Varying Channel Capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS Guaranteed Scalable Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems with Time-Varying Channel Capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284875/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804494","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4284875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS Guaranteed Scalable Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems with Time-Varying Channel Capacity","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055171S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4284898,"authors":[{"name":"Demba E.

The original MVDR is excessively sensitive to source location and microphone gains. Previous research has made MVDR practical by successfully increasing the robustness of MVDR to source location, and MVDR-based microphone arrays are already commercially available. Nevertheless, MVDR performance is still weak in cases where microphone gain variations are too large, e.g., for circular arrays of directional microphones. In this paper we propose an improved MVDR beamformer which takes into account the effect of sensors (e.g. microphones) with arbitrary, potentially directional responses. Specifically, we form estimates of the relative magnitude responses of the sensors based on the data received at the array and include those in the original formulation of the MVDR beamforming problem. Experimental results on real-world audio data show an average 2.4 dB improvement over conventional MVDR beamforming, which does not account for the magnitude responses of the sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9804513","htmlLink":"/document/4284898/","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced MVDR Beamforming for Arrays of Directional Microphones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced MVDR Beamforming for Arrays of Directional Microphones","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090999S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4284914,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406106900"},{"name":"Beibei Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Beibei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37423124400"},{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281434600"},{"name":"Wenli Xu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278553200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284914","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Noise shaping","Video codecs","Frequency","Arithmetic","Code standards","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","transform coding","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","3D anisotropic dual-tree wavelet transform","discrete wavelet transform","image patterns","video codecs","motion compensation"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the use of the anisotropic 3-D dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) for video coding.

The ADDWT extends the superiority of the normal DDWT with more directional subbands without adding to the redundancy. The proposed codec applies SPIHT to each of the ADDWT trees.

Based on the modified lifting-based DWT algorithm, an efficient VLSI architecture for one-dimensional (1D) DWT is derived to reduce the hardware cost and shorten the critical path. The proposed 2D DWT architecture is composed of two 1D processors (row and column processors). Based on the line-based architecture, the column processor can start columnwise transform while only two rows have been processed. For an MxN image, only 5.5N internal memory is required for the 9/7 filter to perform the 2D DWT with the critical path of one multiplier. Finally, Verilog simulation results are presented to show that the proposed architecture in comparison with other existing architectures is fast and efficient for the 2D DWT computation.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4284965","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04284965.pdf","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4284965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4284965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4284965/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4284965/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804573","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061403S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4284965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4284972,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Yiu Lee","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Yiu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656614600"},{"name":"Yu-Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Cheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37695464000"},{"name":"Chi-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Ling","lastName":"Wu","id":"37931865100"},{"name":"Chin-Hsiang Chang","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Hsiang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37402704500"},{"name":"You-Ming Tsao","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"You-Ming","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37540398800"},{"name":"Shao-Yi Chien","affiliation":["Media IC and System Lab, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Yi","lastName":"Chien","id":"37279813300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4284972","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":447},"abstract":"In this paper, multi-pass and frame parallel algorithms are proposed to accelerate various motion estimation (ME) tools in H.264 with the graphics processing unit (GPU). By the multi-pass method to unroll and rearrange the multiple nested loops, the integer-pel ME can be implemented with two-pass process on GPU. Moreover, fractional ME needs six passes for frame interpolation with six-tap filter and motion vector refinement. Motion estimation with multiple reference frames can be implemented with two-pass process with frame-level parallel scheme by use of SIMD vector operations of GPU.

In this paper, a blind forensics approach based on DWT (discrete wavelet transform) and SVD (singular value decomposition) is proposed to detect the specific artifact. Firstly, DWT is applied to the image, and SVD is used on fixed-size blocks of low-frequency component in wavelet sub-band to yield a reduced dimension representation. Then the SV vectors are then lexicographically sorted and duplicated image blocks will be close in the sorted list, and therefore will be compared during the detection steps. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only decrease computational complexity, but also localize the duplicated regions accurately even when the image was highly compressed or edge processed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04285009.pdf","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1753","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4285009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4285009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sorted Neighborhood Approach for Detecting Duplicated Regions in Image Forgeries Based on DWT and SVD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forgery","Discrete wavelet transforms","Forensics","Image edge detection","Digital images","Watermarking","Image coding","Digital signatures","Discrete cosine transforms","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image processing","security of data","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorted neighborhood approach","image forgery","digital image forensics","blind forensics approach","discrete wavelet transform","singular value decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Sorted Neighborhood Approach for Detecting Duplicated Regions in Image Forgeries Based on DWT and SVD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9804615","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sorted Neighborhood Approach for Detecting Duplicated Regions in Image Forgeries Based on DWT and SVD","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065365S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4284552","isNumber":"4284553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4284552","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4284553","articleId":"4285009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285028,"authors":[{"name":"Brandyn White","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Brandyn","lastName":"White","id":"37531350900"},{"name":"Mubarak Shah","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Mubarak","lastName":"Shah","id":"37275509600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1016-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1017-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4285028","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":318},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Layout","Object detection","Gaussian processes","Surveillance","Cameras","Motion detection","Humans","Pixel","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image sequences","particle swarm optimisation","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian background subtraction algorithm","automatic tuning","particle swarm optimization","learning rates","fuse multiple methods","fitness function","ground-truth image sequence","Wallflower data-set"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2007.4285028","pdfPath":"/iel5/4284552/4284553/04285028.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4284553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2007.4285028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatically Tuning Background Subtraction Parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"A common trait of background subtraction algorithms is that they have learning rates, thresholds, and initial values that are hand-tuned for a scenario in order to produce the desired subtraction result; however, the need to tune these parameters makes it difficult to use state-of-the-art methods, fuse multiple methods, and choose an algorithm based on the current application as it requires the end-user to become proficient in tuning a new parameter set. The proposed solution is to automate this task by using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to maximize a fitness function compared to provided ground-truth images. The fitness function used is the F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.

There are three complicating factors. The first is that because of physical limitations (e.g., communication bandwidth) only a small subset of the available sensors can be utilized at any one time. The second complication is that the associations of measurements to targets/clutter are unknown. The third complication is that the total number of targets in the surveillance region is unknown and possibly time varying. It are these second and third factors that extend previous work [ Tharmarasa, R., Kirubarajan, T., and Hernandez, M. L. Large-scale optimal sensor array management for multitarget tracking. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, to be published.]. Hence sensors must be utilized in an efficient manner to alleviate association ambiguities and to allow accurate estimation of the states of a varying number of targets. We pose the problem as a bi-criterion optimization with the two objectives of (1) controlling the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound ((PCRLB) which provides a measure of the optimal achievable accuracy of target state estimation), and (2) maximizing the probability of detecting new targets. Only recently have expressions for multitarget PCRLBs been determined [Hue, C, Le Cadre, J.-P., and Perez, P]. Performance analysis of two sequential Monte Carlo methods and posterior Cramer-Rao bounds for multitarget tracking. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Fusion, vol. 1, Annapolis, MD, July 2002, 464-473.], and the necessary simulation techniques are computationally expensive. However, in this paper we show the existence of a multitarget information reduction matrix (IRM) which can be calculated off-line in most cases. Additionally, we propose some approximations that further reduce the computational load. We present solution methodologies that, in simulations, are shown to determine efficient utilization strategies for the available sensor resources, with some sensors selected to track existing targets and others given the primary task of surveillance in order to identify new threats.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.4285352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4285339/04285352.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.4285352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCRLB-based multisensor array management for multitarget tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285352/","displayDocTitle":"PCRLB-based multisensor array management for multitarget tracking","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9665262","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285352/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCRLB-based multisensor array management for multitarget tracking","sourcePdf":"43aes02-Tharmarasa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11338S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285354,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Castillo-Rubio","affiliation":["Polytechnical University of Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4285339/4285354/4285354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos Castillo-Rubio received the telecommunication engineering degree (equivalent to electrical engineering) from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain, in 2003.","From 2002 to 2004 he was a research engineer at the Microwave and Radar Group (GMR) in the UPM, where he developed signal processing algorithms for synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

New apodization methods, such as spatially variant apodization (SVA), apply nonlinear filtering to the signal in order to completely remove sidelobes without any loss of resolution. However, the results are strongly influenced by signal sampling rate. Some variations which improve results have been previously published, but sidelobe cancellation gets worse since sampling frequency is not settled at Nyquist (or a multiple). This paper presents a new and efficient technique based on SVA that drastically reduces sidelobe levels for every sampling rate condition. The algorithm is, essentially, a parameter optimization of a variant filter for each pixel of the image. A one-dimensional case and a two-dimensional generalization are presented, as well as some applications to target detection capability in a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","volume":"43","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9686026","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285354/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust SVA method for every sampling rate condition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust SVA method for every sampling rate condition","sourcePdf":"43aes02-Castillo-Rubio.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105235S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285357,"authors":[{"name":"Henk A.P.

If the possibility of unresolved measurements is not modelled then it is quite likely that either the two tracks coalesce or that one of the two tracks diverges on false measurements. In literature a robust measurement resolution model has been incorporated within an interacting multiple model/multiple hypothesis tracking (IMM/MHT) track maintenance setting. A straightforward incorporation of the same model within an IMM and probabilistic data association (PDA)-like hypothesis merging approach suffers from track coalescence. In order to improve this situation, the paper develops a track-coalescence avoiding hypotheses merging version for the two target problem considered. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the novel filters are compared with applying hypotheses merging approaches that ignore the possibility of unresolved measurements or track-coalescence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285357/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9633732","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian tracking of two possibly unresolved maneuvering targets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian tracking of two possibly unresolved maneuvering targets","sourcePdf":"43aes02-Blom.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082877S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":4285358,"authors":[{"name":"Sherman C.

The approach involves estimating and compensating aspects of the spatially varying bistatic clutter response in both angle and Doppler prior to adaptive clutter suppression. An important feature of the proposed method is its ability to extract requisite implementation information from the data itself, rather than rely on ancillary - and possibly erroneous or missing - system measurements. We justify the essence of the proposed method by showing its ability to align the dominant clutter subspaces of each range realization relative to a suitably chosen reference point as a means of homogenizing the space-time data set. Moreover, we numerically characterize performance using synthetic bistatic clutter data. For the examples considered herein, the proposed bistatic STAP method leads to maximum performance improvements between 17.25 dB and 20.75 dB relative to traditional STAP application, with average improvements of 6 dB to 10 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.4285360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4285339/04285360.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.4285360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"651","endPage":"672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive cancellation method for geometry-induced nonstationary bistatic clutter environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive cancellation method for geometry-induced nonstationary bistatic clutter environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285360/","volume":"43","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4285360/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9610211","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive cancellation method for geometry-induced nonstationary bistatic clutter environments","sourcePdf":"43aes02-Melvin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084215S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285362,"authors":[{"name":"Matti Vihola","affiliation":["Datactica Limited, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4285339/4285362/4285362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matti Vihola was born in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland in 1978.

To this end we resort to the modified generalized likelihood ratio test (MGLRT) and devise a robust detector, the orthogonal rejection MGLRT (OR-MGLRT), capable of deciding whether some observations contain a useful target or if they contain a signal belonging to the orthogonal complement of the useful subspace. Hence we investigate the possibility of exploiting the new algorithm as the second stage of a double threshold receiving structure, obtained cascading the MGLRT and the OR-MGLRT. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new double threshold decision rule, both in the matched and mismatched signal cases, also in comparison with previously proposed receivers. The results show that the new test allows for a wide range of compromises between the detection and the rejection performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9633733","htmlLink":"/document/4285365/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive detection of range spread targets with orthogonal rejection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive detection of range spread targets with orthogonal rejection","sourcePdf":"43aes02-DeMaio.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079108S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285370,"authors":[{"name":"Allessio Balleri","affiliation":["Departimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Allessio","lastName":"Balleri","id":"37086623237"},{"name":"Arye Nehorai","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Arye","lastName":"Nehorai","id":"37265777100"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292920600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"4285370","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":155,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1280},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Lakes","Sea measurements","Radar clutter","Speckle","Random processes","Reflection","Inverse problems","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","gamma distribution","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real lake-clutter data","Cramer-Rao bounds","fractional moments estimates","parameter estimation","compound-Gaussian clutter modeling","inverse gamma distributed texture","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"abstract":"The inverse gamma distributed texture is important for modeling compound-Gaussian clutter (e.g. for sea reflections), due to the simplicity of estimating its parameters.

Due to the geometric separation of the platforms, target statistics are modeled as independent from platform to platform but constant over the local data on a single platform. Clutter statistics are also assumed independent from platform to platform but have a local space-time correlation structure typical of monostatic space-time adaptive processing (STAP). Moreover, the target Doppler hypothesis varies from platform to platform due to multiple viewing perspectives. Previous published work has investigated the detection improvement obtained by multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) radar. This prior work, however, has only considered white noise. When clutter is considered, the diversity benefit of a MIMO or multistatic radar system is strongly dependent on geometry. We investigate the relationship between geometry and diversity gain for multistatic airborne space-time radar and the effects of this relationship on decentralized and centralized detection.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2007.4285374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4285339/04285374.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2007.4285374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285339","startPage":"806","endPage":"813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum and decentralized detection for multistatic airborne radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum and decentralized detection for multistatic airborne radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9692406","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285374/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum and decentralized detection for multistatic airborne radar","sourcePdf":"43aes02-Goodman-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052356S","chronDate":"April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4285339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4285339","articleId":"4285374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4285618,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Cena","affiliation":["IEIIT-CNR, Italian National Council of Research, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/4285614/4285618/4285618-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gianluca Cena received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Polytechnic of Turin, Turin, Italy, in 1991 and 1996, respectively.","In 1995, he became Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Engineering of the Polytechnic of Turin, and since 2001, he has been a Senior Researcher with the Italian National Research Council (CNR).

The resulting electrodes feature an organized array of high-aspect-ratio microscale posts fabricated on the current collector to increase their surface area and volume for a given footprint area of the device. The diameter of the posts ranges from a few micrometers to a few hundred micrometers, with aspect ratios as high as 50. The fabrication approach is based on micromolding of the electrode materials and subsequent etching of the mold to release the electrode structures. Deep reactive-ion-etching or photo-assisted anodic etching has been used to form an array of deep holes in the silicon mold. Electroplating or colloidal-processing method has been used to fill the mold with battery-electrode materials. Measurements on electrochemical half-cells indicated that the 3-D electrode arrays, which are composed of vanadium oxide nanorolls or carbon, exhibited much greater energy densities (per-footprint area) than that of the traditional 2-D electrode geometries. The use of electroplating enabled us to fabricate 3-D interdigitated arrays of nickel and zinc; and battery operation was demonstrated.

Three specific features - the large aspect ratio of the micronozzle, the structure of the sudden- expansion inlet, and the asymmetric feedback channels - are developed to induce stable oscillation. The large aspect ratio of the micronozzle diminishes the influence of viscous force, and the inlet structure triggers flow instability. The conjunction of both factors promotes the occurrence of the Coanda effect, and initiates oscillation. The asymmetric feedback channels produce an unbalanced impingement of the inlet flow, thus reinforcing the initial oscillation to become stably periodic. Beyond the function of a microflowmeter, the oscillatory characteristics are applicable to accelerate the biochemical reaction between two fluorescent proteins, B-phycoerythrin and an allophycocyanin alpha subunit. With fluorescence induced with a laser, we detected the proteins at a specific wavelength to define the region of interaction caused by the oscillatory motions, which clearly enhances the rate of reaction of these fluids. To focus on the reaction phenomenon of twin fluids, we demonstrated biotin-streptavidin binding that was detected via a fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET) pair of fluorescent proteins. The FRET signal demonstrated conclusively that the biochemical reaction was promoted through the oscillatory function.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2007.899338","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4285629/04285640.pdf","startPage":"826","endPage":"835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2007.899338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Self-Flapping Microfluidic Oscillator and Diagnosis With Fluorescence Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285640/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Self-Flapping Microfluidic Oscillator and Diagnosis With Fluorescence Methods","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9607878","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285640/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Self-Flapping Microfluidic Oscillator and Diagnosis With Fluorescence Methods","sourcePdf":"16jmems04-jyang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08997S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4285629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4285629","articleId":"4285640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4285643,"authors":[{"name":"Regina Luttge","affiliation":["MESA+Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4285629/4285643/4285643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Regina Luttge received the B.Sc. degree in applied science from Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1993.","She worked on LIGA developments at the Institute f\u00fcr Mikrotechnik Mainz (IMM), Germany, for four-and-a-half years.

The process methodology was demonstrated fabricating out-of-plane polymeric hollow microneedles. First, the fabrication of needle tips was demonstrated for polymeric microneedles with an outer diameter of 250 mum, through-hole capillaries of 75-mum diameter and a needle shaft length of 430 mum by lithographic processing of SU-8 onto simple v-grooves. Second, the technique was extended to gain more freedom in tip shape design, needle shaft length and use of filling materials. A novel combination of silicon dry and wet etching is introduced that allows highly accurate and repetitive lithographic molding of a complex shape. Both techniques consent to the lithographic integration of microfluidic back plates forming a patch-type device. These microneedle-integrated patches offer a feasible solution for medical applications that demand an easy to use point-of-care sample collector, for example, in blood diagnostics for lithium therapy. Although microchip capillary electrophoresis glass devices were addressed earlier, here, we show for the first time the complete diagnostic method based on microneedles made from SU-8.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2007.899339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285629","startPage":"872","endPage":"884","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4285629/04285643.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Lithographic Molding for Microneedle-Based Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285643/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integrated Lithographic Molding for Microneedle-Based Devices","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608309","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Lithographic Molding for Microneedle-Based Devices","sourcePdf":"16jmems04-luttge.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145999S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4285629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4285629","articleId":"4285643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285644,"authors":[{"name":"Lynda Metref","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics and Microsystems, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4285629/4285644/4285644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lynda Metref received the Master's degree in microtechnology from the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2005, with a thesis on fabrication of a microdosing and sampling system for lab-on-chip applications.

The array consists of multiple planar complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor stimulating probes and 3-D assembly components. Parylene-encapsulated gold beams supported by etch-stopped silicon braces allow the backends of the probes to be folded over to reduce the height of the array above the cortical surface. A process permitting parylene to be used at wafer level with bulk-silicon wet release has been reported. Spacers are used to fix the microassembled probes in position and are equipped with interlocking structures to facilitate the assembly process and increase yield. Four-probe 256-site 3-D arrays operate from plusmn5 V with an average per-channel power dissipation of 97 muW at full range stimulation with pulse widths of 100 mus at 500-Hz frequency. Thirty-two sites can be stimulated simultaneously with maximum currents of plusmn127 muA and a current resolution of plusmn1 muA. The microassembly techniques allow a variety of 3-D microstructures to be created from planar components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","volume":"16","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"9616023","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285655/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Microassembled Low-Profile Three-Dimensional Microelectrode Array for Neural Prosthesis Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Microassembled Low-Profile Three-Dimensional Microelectrode Array for Neural Prosthesis Applications","sourcePdf":"16jmems04-yao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078047S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4285629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4285629","articleId":"4285655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285658,"authors":[{"name":"Atallah Balalem","affiliation":["Chair of Microwave and Communication Engineering, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Atallah","lastName":"Balalem","id":"37550287800"},{"name":"Ali R.

Therefore, the drive topology and control strategy used in HEC cannot be applied to HES directly. This paper presents a single-stage bidirectional dc/ac converter based on a general full-bridge inverter. The converter is designed for a low-voltage brushless dc motor/alternator (BLDCM/A) used in HESs, in which the additional bulky inductor and power switches are eliminated in the proposed design. In order to increase the reliability of the commutation process, a cost-effective sensorless control scheme for the motor and alternator commutation is developed. The commutation signals are extracted directly from the average terminal voltages, in which the motor neutral voltage, multistage analog Alters, analog-to-digital converters, and the complex digital phase-shift (delay) circuits are eliminated. In addition, instead of using the complex flux- weakening control technique, the winding-changeover technique is exploited to extend the range of the operating speed. With attractive features, such as low cost and ease of implementation, the proposed approach is particularly suitable for electric bikes, electric scooters, HESs, etc. Theoretical analysis and several experiments are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285704/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610185","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a Highly Reliable Hybrid Electric Scooter Drive","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a Highly Reliable Hybrid Electric Scooter Drive","sourcePdf":"54tie05-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046044S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4285705,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Coleman","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4282101/4285705/4285705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Coleman received the B.Eng. degree (with first-class honors) in electronic engineering from the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland, in 2002.

In addition to the immediate display of the remaining battery capacity to the user, precise knowledge of SOC exerts additional control over the charging/discharging process, which can be employed to increase battery life. This reduces the risk of overvoltage and gassing, which degrade the chemical composition of the electrolyte and plates. The proposed model in this paper determines the SOC by incorporating the changes occurring due to terminal voltage, current load, and internal resistance, which mitigate the disadvantages of using impedance only. Electromotive force (EMF) voltage is predicted while the battery is under load conditions; from the estimated EMF voltage, the SOC is then determined. The method divides the battery voltage curve into two regions: 1) the linear region for full to partial SOC and 2) the hyperbolic region from partial to low SOC. Algorithms are developed to correspond to the different characteristic changes occurring within each region. In the hyperbolic region, the rate of change in impedance and terminal voltage is greater than that in the linear region. The magnitude of current discharge causes varying rates of change to the terminal voltage and impedance. Experimental tests and results are presented to validate the new models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285705/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9617854","volume":"54","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"State-of-Charge Determination From EMF Voltage Estimation: Using Impedance, Terminal Voltage, and Current for Lead-Acid and Lithium-Ion Batteries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-of-Charge Determination From EMF Voltage Estimation: Using Impedance, Terminal Voltage, and Current for Lead-Acid and Lithium-Ion Batteries","sourcePdf":"54tie05-coleman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059546S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"284","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4285707,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4282101/4285707/4285707-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Gao received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

The observation gains and uncertainties prediction rules are derived in the sense of Lyapunov theory so that the stability of the proposed estimation scheme is fulfilled. Second, to ensure perfect tracking of the output torque and providing means in eliminating torque ripples, the frequency modes of the disturbances to be eliminated should be included in the stable closed-loop system. To achieve this objective, a hybrid-type variable-structure controller with internal model, for the flux harmonics and system uncertainties, is adopted. The hybrid controller shows better disturbance rejection without control chattering.

In particular, active power control will play an important role both during grid faults (low-voltage ride-through capability and controlled current injection) and in normal conditions (reserve function and frequency regulation). The aim of this paper is to propose a flexible active power control based on a fast current controller and a reconfigurable reference current selector. Several strategies to select the current reference are studied and compared using experimental results that are obtained during an unsymmetrical voltage fault. The results of the analysis allow selection of the best reference current in every condition. The proposed methods facilitate multiple choices for fault ride through by simply changing the reference selection criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.899914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.899914","startPage":"2583","endPage":"2592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4282101/04285709.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Active Power Control of Distributed Power Generation Systems During Grid Faults","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Active Power Control of Distributed Power Generation Systems During Grid Faults","volume":"54","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9608436","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285709/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Active Power Control of Distributed Power Generation Systems During Grid Faults","sourcePdf":"54tie05-rodriguez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12605S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"515","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4285712,"authors":[{"name":"Kinattingal Sundareswaran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4282101/4285712/4285712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kinattingal Sundareswaran (S'96\u2013M'07) was born in Pallassana, India, in 1966.

In this control scheme, a GA control system via backstepping design technique is utilized to be the major controller, and adaptation laws derived from Lyapunov stability analyses are manipulated to adjust appropriate evolutionary steps. As a result, the system stability can be guaranteed directly without strict constraint conditions and detailed system knowledge. The effectiveness of the proposed drive and control system is verified by experimental results in the presence of uncertainties. From the measured results, the LGAC system performs superior high-precision motion control under wide operation range than conventional backstepping control system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.899934","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.899934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4282101/04285714.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Lyapunov-Based Genetic Algorithm Control for Linear Piezoelectric Ceramic Motor Drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285714/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Development of Lyapunov-Based Genetic Algorithm Control for Linear Piezoelectric Ceramic Motor Drive","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4285714/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9608437","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Lyapunov-Based Genetic Algorithm Control for Linear Piezoelectric Ceramic Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"54tie05-wai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114792S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4285715,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Xiao","affiliation":["University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4282101/4285715/4285715-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weidong Xiao (S'03) received the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2003, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include power electronics and applications of renewable energy sources."]},"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37279924700"},{"name":"William G.

Comprehensive experimental evaluations have successfully illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.899922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4282101/04285715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.899922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282101","startPage":"2539","endPage":"2549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Centered Differentiation and Steepest Descent to Maximum Power Point Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of Centered Differentiation and Steepest Descent to Maximum Power Point Tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618911","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Centered Differentiation and Steepest Descent to Maximum Power Point Tracking","sourcePdf":"54tie05-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063304S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4285737,"authors":[{"name":"Antonino Tumeo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonino","lastName":"Tumeo","id":"37391915300"},{"name":"Marco Branca","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Branca","id":"37936642900"},{"name":"Lorenzo Camerini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Camerini","id":"37936643100"},{"name":"Matteo Monchiero","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Monchiero","id":"37424560000"},{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Fabrizio Ferrandi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Ferrandi","id":"37298982800"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1058-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4285737","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Multiprocessing systems","Hardware","Broadcasting","Software libraries","Prototypes","Process design","Embedded system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","interrupts","logic design","multiprocessing systems","peripheral interfaces","software libraries","software packages","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interrupt controller based programming","FPGA-based multiprocessors","software threads","standard off-of-the-shelf softcores","software library","peripheral interface","system-on-chip"]}],"abstract":"Interrupt-based programming is widely used for interfacing a processor with peripherals and allowing software threads to interact.

This paper presents the architecture of an interrupt controller for a FPGA-based multiprocessor composed of standard off-of-the-shelf softcores. The main feature of this device is to distribute multiple interrupts across the cores of a multiprocessor. In addition, our architecture supports several advanced features like booking, broadcasting and inter-processor interrupt. On the top of this hardware layer, we provide a software library to effectively exploit this mechanism. We realized a prototype of this system. Our experiments show that our interrupt controller efficiently distributes multiple interrupts on the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2007.4285737","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4285717/4285718/04285737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2007.4285737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285718","startPage":"82","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interrupt Controller for FPGA-based Multiprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Interrupt Controller for FPGA-based Multiprocessors","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285737/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9622352","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interrupt Controller for FPGA-based Multiprocessors","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"ICSAMOS-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054359S","chronDate":"16-19 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4285717","isNumber":"4285718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4285717","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4285718","articleId":"4285737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4285745,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Ferrandi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Ferrandi","id":"37298982800"},{"name":"Pier Luca Lanzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Pier Luca","lastName":"Lanzi","id":"37352642300"},{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Christian Pilato","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Pilato","id":"37392699300"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"},{"name":"Antonino Tumeo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonino","lastName":"Tumeo","id":"37391915300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1058-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4285745","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Space exploration","Optimization methods","High level languages","High level synthesis","Evolutionary computation","Sorting","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","hardware description languages","high level languages","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithm","NSGA-II","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","NP-complete problem","high-level synthesis","hardware description language","RTL design","register-transfer level","high-level language","programmable devices","multiple complex module synthesis","EMO","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","field programmable gate array","FPGA design"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new methodology based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) to synthesize multiple complex modules on programmable devices (FPGAs). It starts from a behavioral description written in a common high-level language (for instance C) to automatically produce the register-transfer level (RTL) design in a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog). Since all high-level synthesis problems (scheduling, allocation and binding) are notoriously NP-complete and interdependent, the three problems should be considered simultaneously. This drives to a wide design space, that needs to be thoroughly explored to obtain solutions able to satisfy the design constraints. Evolutionary algorithms are good candidates to tackle such complex explorations. In this paper we provide a solution based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to explore the design space in order obtain the best solutions in terms of performance given the area constraints of a target FPGA device. Moreover, it has been integrated a good cost estimation model to guarantee the quality of the solutions found without requiring a complete synthesis for the validation of each generation, an impractical and time consuming operation. We show on the JPEG case study that the proposed approach provides good results in terms of trade-off between total area occupied and execution time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Approach to Area-Time Optimization of FPGA designs","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2007.4285745","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4285717/4285718/04285745.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2007.4285745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Approach to Area-Time Optimization of FPGA designs","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285745/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9622360","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Approach to Area-Time Optimization of FPGA designs","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"ICSAMOS-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074276S","chronDate":"16-19 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4285717","isNumber":"4285718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4285717","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4285718","articleId":"4285745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4285751,"authors":[{"name":"Nele Mentens","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nele","lastName":"Mentens","id":"37272474100"},{"name":"Kazuo Sakiyama","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Sakiyama","id":"37281944700"},{"name":"Lejla Batina","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lejla","lastName":"Batina","id":"37272479700"},{"name":"Bart Preneel","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Preneel","id":"37272469600"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["ESAT, SCD/COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1058-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4285751","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Elliptic curve cryptography","Public key cryptography","Hardware","Logic devices","Silicon","Information security","Information systems","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded environment","public key cryptography","FPGA","side-channel analysis attacks","programmable coprocessor design","field programmable gate arrays","RSA standard"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design of a programmable coprocessor for public key cryptography (PKC) on an FPGA.

A completely dry process is another big advantage over other dicing methods. In SD, the laser beam power of transmissible wavelength is absorbed only around focal point in the wafer by utilizing the temperature dependence of the absorption coefficient of the wafer. The absorbed power forms a modified layer in the wafer, which functions as the origin of separation in the separation process. In this paper, we applied this method for an ultra-thin wafer. The reliability of devices that is diced by SD was confirmed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/66/4285815/04285830.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2007.901849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2007.901849","startPage":"259","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Dicing Technology for Semiconductor Wafer\u2014Stealth Dicing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285830/","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Dicing Technology for Semiconductor Wafer\u2014Stealth Dicing","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285830/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9617768","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Dicing Technology for Semiconductor Wafer\u2014Stealth Dicing","sourcePdf":"20tsm03-kumagai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064812S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"4285815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4285815","articleId":"4285830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285841,"authors":[{"name":"Nabhendra Bisnik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Nabhendra","lastName":"Bisnik","id":"37565476100"},{"name":"Alhussein A.

However, the quality of coverage (QoC) achieved by mobile sensors depends on the velocity, mobility pattern, number of mobile sensors deployed, and the dynamics of the phenomenon being sensed. The gains attained by mobile sensors over static sensors and the optimal motion strategies for mobile sensors are not well understood. In this paper, we consider the following event capture problem: the events of interest arrive at certain points in the sensor field and disappear according to known arrival and departure time distributions. An event is said to be captured if it is sensed by one of the mobile sensors before it fades away. We analyze how the QoC scales with velocity, path, and number of mobile sensors. We characterize cases where the deployment of mobile sensors has no advantage over static sensors, and find the optimal velocity pattern that a mobile sensor should adopt. We also present algorithms for two motion planning problems: 1) for a single sensor, what is the sensor trajectory and the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">minimum speed </i>\nrequired to satisfy a bound on the event loss probability and 2) for sensors with fixed speed, what is the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">minimum number of sensors </i>\nrequired to satisfy a bound on the event loss probability. When the robots are restricted to move along a line or a closed curve, our algorithms return the optimal velocity for the minimum velocity problem. For the minimum sensor problem, the number of sensors used is within a factor of 2 of the optimal solution. For the case where the events occur at arbitrary points on a plane, we present heuristic algorithms for the aforementioned motion planning problems and bound their performance with respect to the optimal.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.900628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4285839/04285841.pdf","endPage":"692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Event Capture Using Mobile Sensors Subject to a Quality Metric","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.900628","startPage":"676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Event Capture Using Mobile Sensors Subject to a Quality Metric","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285841/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9617758","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4285841/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Event Capture Using Mobile Sensors Subject to a Quality Metric","sourcePdf":"23tro04-bisnik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047215S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","isNumber":"4285839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"63","articleId":"4285841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4285848,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Ji","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37285861400"},{"name":"Magnus Egerstedt","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Egerstedt","id":"37269707500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"4285848","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":550,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285848","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Control systems","Multiagent systems","Protocols","Convergence","Mobile agents","Laplace equations","History","Autonomous agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","graph theory","mobile robots","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connected graphs","dynamic interaction graphs","formation control problems","mobile agents","multiagent coordination","multiagent systems","distributed coordination control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connected graphs","formation control","graph Laplacian","multiagent coordination"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.900638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4285839/04285848.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.900638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coordination Control of Multiagent Systems While Preserving Connectedness","abstract":"This paper addresses the connectedness issue in multiagent coordination, i.e., the problem of ensuring that a group of mobile agents stays connected while achieving some performance objective.

Humanoid robots are biped machines that usually possess multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The complexity of their structure and the difficulty in maintaining postural stability make the whole-body control of humanoid robots fundamentally different from fixed-base manipulators. Getting hints from human conscious and subconscious motion generations, the authors propose a method of generating whole-body motions that integrates the operator's command input and the robot's autonomous functions. Instead of giving commands to all the joints all the time, the operator selects only the necessary points of the humanoid robot's body for manipulation. This paper first explains the concept of the system and the framework for integrating operator's command and autonomous functions in whole-body motion generation. Using the framework, autonomous functions were constructed for maintaining postural stability constraint while satisfying the desired trajectory of operation points, including the feet, while interacting with the environment. Finally, this paper reports on the implementation of the proposed method to teleoperate two 30-DOF humanoid robots, HRP-1S and HRP-2, by using only two 3-DOF joysticks. Experiments teleoperating the two robots are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2007.903818","startPage":"763","endPage":"775","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4285839/04285856.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2007.903818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whole-Body Motion Generation Integrating Operator's Intention and Robot's Autonomy in Controlling Humanoid Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humanoid robots","Motion control","Robot control","Humans","Robotics and automation","Stability","Intelligent robots","Manipulators","Joints","Service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["humanoid robots","legged locomotion","motion control","stability","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["whole-body motion generation","robot autonomy","operator control","online control","biped machines","degrees of freedom","postural stability","whole-body control","fixed-base manipulators","teleoperation","30-DOF humanoid robots","HRP-1S","HRP-2","3-DOF joysticks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Humanoid robot","motion control","teleoperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Whole-Body Motion Generation Integrating Operator's Intention and Robot's Autonomy in Controlling Humanoid Robots","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4285856/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9608290","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whole-Body Motion Generation Integrating Operator's Intention and Robot's Autonomy in Controlling Humanoid Robots","sourcePdf":"23tro04-neo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117162S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4285839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4285839","articleId":"4285856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4285862,"authors":[{"name":"Renaud Ronsse","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Liege, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4285839/4285862/4285862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renaud Ronsse was born in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, in 1980.

A TDFA with a dual-pass configuration is superior to a TDFA with a single-pass configuration with regard to power-conversion efficiency, whereas it is inferior with regard to noise figure (NF). We propose a cascaded configuration consisting of a single- and double-pass configuration, which provides high efficiency and a low NF. The configuration generated no interference noise, which can result from multipass interference (MPI) with a double-pass configuration. We achieved gains exceeding 26 dB and NFs of less than 7 dB in the 1480-1510-nm wavelength region (30-nm bandwidth). Furthermore, an 8 times 10-Gb/s transmission experiment also confirmed that there was no MPI-induced excess noise.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.899793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.899793","startPage":"2108","endPage":"2114","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4285866/04285868.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient S-Band Thulium-Doped Fiber Amplifier Employing High-Thulium-Concentration Doping Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient S-Band Thulium-Doped Fiber Amplifier Employing High-Thulium-Concentration Doping Technique","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","volume":"25","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4285868/","accessionNumber":"9610046","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285868/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient S-Band Thulium-Doped Fiber Amplifier Employing High-Thulium-Concentration Doping Technique","sourcePdf":"25jlt08-aozasa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101181S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4285866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4285866","articleId":"4285868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4285869,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Tang Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4285866/4285869/4285869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Tang Chang was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in March 1958.

This study proposes an alternative to huge code-space size techniques such as wavelength hopping/time spreading or spectral-phase coding for network protection against eavesdropping by exploiting the cyclic properties of arrayed-waveguide-grating routers and maximal-length sequence code (M-sequence code). In addition, the network is protected using a dynamic reconfigurable coding/decoding scheme based on optical switches and a dynamic code matrix assignment scheme implemented using simple electrical shift registers. The signal-to-beat noise ratio is evaluated for various data bit rates to provide an indication of the confidentiality of the power level for a specified bit error rate (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub>\n<10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n). To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, this paper investigates a weighted load balance problem based on the power distribution of each transmitted wavelength under various eavesdropping abilities. A dynamic codeword modification is proposed which identifies the code matrix assignment that minimizes the degree of weighted load balance (DWLB). The evaluation results show that the reconfiguration policy outperforms one class of static policies in terms of two performance metrics, namely, the DWLB and the number of register shifts required to reconfigure the code matrix assignment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Design for Reconfigurable Coder/Decoders to Protect Against Eavesdropping in Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical CDMA Networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.901333","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4285866/04285869.pdf","startPage":"1931","endPage":"1948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.901333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Design for Reconfigurable Coder/Decoders to Protect Against Eavesdropping in Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical CDMA Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4285869/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608284","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Design for Reconfigurable Coder/Decoders to Protect Against Eavesdropping in Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"25jlt08-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091215S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4285866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4285866","articleId":"4285869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4285881,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Grobnic","affiliation":["Optical Communications and Electrophotonics Group, Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4285866/4285881/4285881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Grobnic received the M.Sc. degree in physics from Bucharest University, Bucharest, Romania, in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree in engineering physics from Politehica University Bucharest, in 1996.","From 1996 to 2003, he was with JDS Uniphase as a Scientist and was involved in the development of fiber Bragg grating and waveguide devices.

The new synchronous coding scheme supports larger cardinality and better performance than the asynchronous scheme because Walsh code has a larger cardinality than Barker sequences and has a zero cross-correlational property at the expense of system synchronization. One potential application is future CDMA-based passive optical networks, in which synchronous downstream traffic uses the Walsh-based bipolar-bipolar code and asynchronous upstream traffic uses the Barker-based counterpart.

The results provide a profile of how these nonlinear receivers perform with various system settings. It is found that, when an m-sequence is used as the spreading code, the encoded signal does not obey Gaussian statistics, and the system performs better than an equivalent system using a random code.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4285866/04285897.pdf","startPage":"2069","endPage":"2080","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.901338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.901338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Nonlinear Receivers in Asynchronous Spectral-Phase-Encoding Optical CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Nonlinear optics","Multiaccess communication","Optical harmonic generation","Photodetectors","Optical modulation","Decoding","Optical pulses","Multiple access interference","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","code division multiple access","m-sequences","optical harmonic generation","optical receivers","phase coding","random codes","self-phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear receivers","asynchronous spectral-phase-encoding optical CDMA systems","low-intensity interference","second harmonic generation","self-phase modulation effects","m-sequences","random binary codes","Gaussian statistics","spreading code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear receiver","optical code-division multiple access (OCDMA)","second harmonic generation (SHG)","self-phase modulation (SPM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Nonlinear Receivers in Asynchronous Spectral-Phase-Encoding Optical CDMA Systems","volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4285897/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9620463","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Nonlinear Receivers in Asynchronous Spectral-Phase-Encoding Optical CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"25jlt08-ni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077479S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4285866","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4285866","articleId":"4285897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285905,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Raad","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Laval University, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4285866/4285905/4285905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Raad was born in Rahb\u00e9, Lebanon, on August 24, 1978.

A joint transmission power and overlapping coefficient (transmission rate) allocation strategy is provided via the solution of a constrained convex quadratic optimization problem. The solution of this problem maximizes the aggregate throughput subject to peak laser transmission power constraints. The optimization problem is solved in a closed form, and the resource allocation strategy is simple to implement in an optical network. Simulation results are presented, showing a total agreement between the derived analytical solution and the one obtained using a numerical search method.

The silver paste was prepared by mixing nanoscale silver particles with carefully selected organic components which can burn out within the low-temperature firing range. SiC Schottky diodes were placed onto stencil-printed layers of the nanoscale silver paste on Au or Ag metallized direct bonded copper (DBC) substrates for the die-attachment. After heating up to 300degC and dwell for 40 min in air to burn out the organic components in the paste and to sinter the nanoscale silver, the paste consolidated into a strong and uniform die-attach bonding layer with purity >99% and density >80%. Then the die-attached SiC devices were cooled down to room temperature and their top terminals were wire-bonded to achieve the high-temperature power packages. Then the power packages were heated up from room temperature to 300degC for high-temperature operation and characterization. Results of the measurement demonstrate the low-temperature silver sintering as an effective die-attach method for high-temperature electronic packaging. An advanced packaging structure for future SiC transistors with several potential advantages was also proposed based on the low-temperature sintering technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285921/","volume":"30","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4285921/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9620457","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Temperature Operation of SiC Power Devices by Low-Temperature Sintered Silver Die-Attachment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Temperature Operation of SiC Power Devices by Low-Temperature Sintered Silver Die-Attachment","sourcePdf":"30tadvp03-bai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06509S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4285919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4285919","articleId":"4285921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285958,"authors":[{"name":"Winston Langeslag","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Nijmegen, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4282101/4285958/4285958-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Winston Langeslag was born in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, in 1970.

The PFC cell is used as a preregulator to comply with line-current harmonic standards, while the flyback converter operates in quasi-resonant (QR)/discontinuous conduction mode to deliver to the load a maximum output power of 120 W. The control functions of the PFC and flyback converters are combined in a unique system-on-chip-ASIC solution to reduce system complexity. The ASIC implements valley-switching control of both the PFC and flyback cells to achieve QR operation. The concept of ldquovalley skippingrdquo is also recalled by the proposed ASIC to determine the operating point in the power-frequency characteristic of the power converter. Depending on the output-power requirement, the ASIC drives the flyback stage into three different states, which result from the combination of the QR and valley-skipping modes. This allows the flyback converter to operate at a fixed on-time, while its off-time is changed according to the output power. The PFC stage is also driven in the QR mode with valley skipping to provide the DC-DC stage with a fixed input voltage of 400 V. To evaluate the performances of the presented ASIC device, a demoboard of a 120-W PFC-flyback system has been realized and tested. Several experimental results have been carried out to confer the validity of the approach that is discussed throughout this paper and to evaluate the performances of the AC-DC rectifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4282101/04285958.pdf","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.894735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.894735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4282101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI Design and Application of a High-Voltage-Compatible SoC\u2013ASIC in Bipolar CMOS/DMOS Technology for AC\u2013DC Rectifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Very large scale integration","Rectifiers","Application specific integrated circuits","Power generation","Performance evaluation","Integrated circuit technology","AC-DC power converters","Circuit topology","Power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","BiCMOS integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","rectifiers","system-on-chip","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","high-voltage-compatible SoC-ASIC","bipolar CMOS/DMOS technology","AC-DC rectifiers","application-specific integrated circuit controller","double-stage AC-DC power converters","power-factor correction","flyback topology","line-current harmonic standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)","flyback","power-factor correction (PFC)","system integration","valley-switching control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Design and Application of a High-Voltage-Compatible SoC\u2013ASIC in Bipolar CMOS/DMOS Technology for AC\u2013DC Rectifiers","volume":"54","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4285958/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606586","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Design and Application of a High-Voltage-Compatible SoC\u2013ASIC in Bipolar CMOS/DMOS Technology for AC\u2013DC Rectifiers","sourcePdf":"54tie05-langeslag.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104303S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4282101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4282101","articleId":"4285958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4285962,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Such inclusions, in fact, can be employed in the design of both mu-negative (MNG) materials and artificial magnetodielectrics (with negative and high-positive values of the real part of the permeability, respectively). The inclusions here considered are the multiple split-ring resonators (MSRRs), that represent a straightforward extension of the commonly used split-ring resonators (SRRs), and the spiral resonators (SRs), that enable a greater miniaturization rate. Some physical insights on the resonance mechanism and on the inherent saturation of the resonant frequency when increasing the number of the rings of the MSRRs and the number of the turns of the SRs are given in the paper. New and accurate analytical design formulas, based on a quasi-static model, for both MSRRs and SRs are derived and tested through a proper comparison with the existing formulas and full-wave numerical results. Both MSRRs and SRs are shown to be useful to reduce the electrical dimensions of the resonant inclusions when synthesizing artificial metamaterials.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4285964/04285968.pdf","startPage":"2258","endPage":"2267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.901950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.901950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4285968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Spiral and Multiple Split-Ring Resonators for the Realization of Miniaturized Metamaterial Samples","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Metamaterials","Magnetic materials","Permeability","Magnetic resonance","Geometry","Electromagnetic fields","Saturation magnetization","Resonant frequency","Dielectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metamaterials","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiral resonator","multiple split-ring resonator","miniaturized metamaterial sample","miniaturized resonant inclusion","mu-negative material","artificial magnetodielectrics","artificial metamaterial","resonant magnetic inclusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metamaterials","$\\mu$ -negative (MNG) metamaterials","resonant magnetic inclusions","split ring resonators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4285968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Spiral and Multiple Split-Ring Resonators for the Realization of Miniaturized Metamaterial Samples","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4285968/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9615990","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Spiral and Multiple Split-Ring Resonators for the Realization of Miniaturized Metamaterial Samples","sourcePdf":"55tap08-bilotti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078003S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4285964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"4285964","articleId":"4285968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4285989,"authors":[{"name":"Valent\u00cdn de la Rubia","affiliation":["Departamento de Electromagnetismo y Teor\u00eda de Circuitos, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4285964/4285989/4285989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Valent\u00edn de la Rubia was born in Ciudad Real, Spain, in 1980.

The method makes use of the property that for a planar array with periodic spacing of the elements, an inverse Fourier transform relationship exists between the array factor and the element excitations. This property is used in an iterative way to derive the array element excitations from the prescribed array factor. The same method is also able to partially compensate the degradation of the sidelobe and gain performance of array patterns due to element failures. Numerical examples of array-failure correction using this method are given for ultralow sidelobe sum and difference patterns of a 5800-element circular array where the failed elements are randomly dispersed across the aperture. The tapers in this array are created exclusively by active weighting in the transmit/receive (T/R) modules using variable gain control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4285964/04286013.pdf","startPage":"2211","endPage":"2218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.902008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.902008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Element Failure Correction for a Large Monopulse Phased Array Antenna With Active Amplitude Weighting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Antenna arrays","Planar arrays","Fourier transforms","Degradation","Array signal processing","Performance gain","Apertures","Gain control","Gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","Fourier transforms","iterative methods","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["element failure correction","large monopulse phased array antenna","amplitude weighting","low sidelobe pattern","planar array antenna","periodic element arrangement","Fourier transform","iterative method","element excitation","variable gain control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna pattern synthesis","element failure correction","phased arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Element Failure Correction for a Large Monopulse Phased Array Antenna With Active Amplitude Weighting","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4286013/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618741","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Element Failure Correction for a Large Monopulse Phased Array Antenna With Active Amplitude Weighting","sourcePdf":"55tap08-keizer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041313S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4285964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4285964","articleId":"4286013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4286014,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad H.

However, using different grid sizes increases the truncation error at the interface between domains having different grid sizes. The truncation error is manifested as a spurious reflection from the grid boundary, thus decreasing the simulation accuracy. In this paper, we apply the complementary derivatives method (CDM) to reduce the spurious reflections arising from the use of different grid size domains when using the ADI-FDTD method. It is shown that, the CDM guarantees uniform second-order accuracy throughout the computational domain. When the CDM is implemented in the ADI-FDTD method, the implicit updating equations cannot be written in a tri-diagonal matrix and the computational efficiency of the ADI-FDTD method is not preserved. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula, we retain the numerical efficiency of the conventional ADI-FDTD. A representative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the accuracy of CDM in the ADI-FDTD simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4285964/04286014.pdf","startPage":"2294","endPage":"2301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.902012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.902012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Complementary Derivatives Method in the ADI-FDTD Solution of Maxwell's Equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Maxwell equations","Computational modeling","Finite wordlength effects","Reflection","Circuit simulation","Microwave integrated circuits","MMICs","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave reflection","finite difference time-domain analysis","matrix algebra","Maxwell equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complementary derivatives method","ADI-FDTD","Maxwell equations","alternating-direction implicit finite-difference time-domain method","spurious reflection","tri-diagonal matrix","Sherman-Morrison formula"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating-direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD)","complementary derivatives method (CDM)","truncation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Complementary Derivatives Method in the ADI-FDTD Solution of Maxwell's Equations","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4286014/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608267","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Complementary Derivatives Method in the ADI-FDTD Solution of Maxwell's Equations","sourcePdf":"55tap08-kermani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047133S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4285964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","xplore-issue":"4285964","articleId":"4286014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4286015,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Kuang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4285964/4286015/4286015-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Kuang was born in Hefei, China, in 1980.

To create tomographic images from microwave measurements, it is necessary to solve a nonlinear inversion problem, for which an algorithm based on the iterative Gauss-Newton method has been developed at Dartmouth College. This algorithm determines the update values at each iteration by solving the set of normal equations of the problem using the Tikhonov algorithm. In this paper, a new algorithm for determining the iteration update values in the Gauss-Newton algorithm is presented which is based on the conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS) algorithm. The iterative CGLS algorithm is capable of solving the update problem by operating on just the Jacobian and the regularizing effects of the algorithm can easily be controlled by adjusting the number of iterations. The new algorithm is compared to the Gauss-Newton algorithm with Tikhonov regularization and is shown to reconstruct images of similar quality using fewer iterations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4285964/04286026.pdf","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.901993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.901993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Microwave Imaging for Breast-Cancer Screening Using Gauss\u2013Newton's Method and the CGLS Inversion Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave imaging","Breast cancer","Gaussian processes","Iterative algorithms","Least squares methods","Newton method","Recursive estimation","Optical imaging","X-ray imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical imaging","cancer","conjugate gradient methods","microwave imaging","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear microwave imaging","breast-cancer screening","Gauss-Newton method","CGLS inversion algorithm","conjugate gradient least squares algorithm","Tikhonov regularization","biomedical electromagnetic imaging","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical electromagnetic imaging","cancer","electromagnetic scattering inverse problems","image reconstruction","imaging","inverse problems","microwave imaging","nonlinear equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Microwave Imaging for Breast-Cancer Screening Using Gauss\u2013Newton's Method and the CGLS Inversion Algorithm","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4286026/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610028","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Microwave Imaging for Breast-Cancer Screening Using Gauss\u2013Newton's Method and the CGLS Inversion Algorithm","sourcePdf":"55tap08-rubaek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082637S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4285964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"4285964","articleId":"4286026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4286029,"authors":[{"name":"Kin-Fai Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kin-Fai","lastName":"Tong","id":"37077702300"},{"name":"Ting-Pong Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ting-Pong","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280236000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4286029","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4819},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Circularly polarized single-layer U-slot microstrip patch antenna has been proposed.

Although the parallel plate configuration should lead to a narrow band design due to the dispersion characteristics of the TE\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub>\n mode, the measurement results demonstrate broadband characteristics with radiation efficiencies varying between 43% and 72% over the tested frequency band of 26.5-37 GHz. The designed cylindrical Luneberg lens can be used to launch multiple beams by implementing an arc array of planar LTSA elements at the periphery of the lens, and can be easily extended to higher mm-wave frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.901843","startPage":"2147","endPage":"2156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4285964/04286033.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.901843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4285964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fan-Beam Millimeter-Wave Antenna Design Based on the Cylindrical Luneberg Lens","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical design","Lenses","Slot antennas","Antenna feeds","Antennas and propagation","Tellurium","Frequency","Millimeter wave propagation","Millimeter wave technology","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","millimetre wave antenna arrays","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arc array","dispersion characteristics","time domain numerical solver","radiation pattern","combined ray-optics/diffraction method","feed antenna","planar linear tapered slot antenna","Luneberg law","polymer material","parallel plates","TE10 mode propagation","2D cylindrical Luneberg lens","fan-beam millimeter-wave antenna","frequency 26.5 GHz to 37 GHz","size 10 cm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cylindrical lens","fan beam","Luneberg Lens","millimeter waves","multiple beams","tapered slot antenna","wideband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Fan-Beam Millimeter-Wave Antenna Design Based on the Cylindrical Luneberg Lens","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4286033/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9620449","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fan-Beam Millimeter-Wave Antenna Design Based on the Cylindrical Luneberg Lens","sourcePdf":"55tap08-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047898S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4285964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4285964","articleId":"4286033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4286034,"authors":[{"name":"Yuntao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281233300"},{"name":"H.

Compared with several existing algorithms, the loss of array aperture is effectively avoided. As a result, the proposed method can estimate DOAs and ranges of (N - 1) polarized near-field sources using N dual-polarization sensors.

The presence of epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) confirms the diagnosis of epilepsy. During the seizures, the scalp of patients with epilepsy is characterized by high amplitude synchronized periodic EEG waveforms, reflecting abnormal discharge of a large group of neurons. Between the seizures, the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the patients who suffer from epilepsy is normally characterized by occasional spikes or spike and wave complexes (inter-ictal activity). It is difficult to detect these and sometimes is missed by the clinicians who observe the paper records.

One of the most efficient methods of performing this transformation is fast Fourier transform (FFT). It has been showed that no algorithm for computing the DFT could have a smaller complexity than the FFT. Thus most FPGA implementations are based on this approach. With the introduction of specialized DSP blocks embedded into programmable architectures the efficiency of FFT is limited by the speed of hardware multipliers of DSP modules. However, programmable architectures provide possibility to increase the performance of digital system by exploitation of parallelisms of implemented algorithms. In this paper application of distributed arithmetic concept to DFT implementation is described. Results showing the performance improvement in comparison to FFT implementation is shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Arithmetic Based Implementation of Fourier Transform Targeted at FPGA Architectures","publicationTitle":"2007 14th International Conference on Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MIXDES.2007.4286139","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 14th International Conference on Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4286105/4286106/04286139.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2007.4286139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Arithmetic Based Implementation of Fourier Transform Targeted at FPGA Architectures","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286139/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9694328","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Arithmetic Based Implementation of Fourier Transform Targeted at FPGA Architectures","confLoc":"Ciechocinek, Poland","sourcePdf":"MIXDES-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055624S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4286105","isNumber":"4286106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286105","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4286106","articleId":"4286139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEETech Univ of Lodz Dept of Microelectronics & Computer Science","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4286149,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Design patterns, intended for simplifying the reuse process, are design experiences that worked well in the past and documented to be reused in the future. In this paper, a design pattern named NnEP (N\u0332eural-n\u0332etwork-based E\u0332mbedded systems design P\u0332attern) is introduced for employing neural networks, common bio-inspired solutions, in SoC-based embedded systems. This pattern is based on NnSP IP suite, a stream processing core and its tool chain, NnSP Builder and Stream Compiler. NnEP is introduced for enhancing and automating reuse in design of intelligent SoC's requiring high-speed parallel computations specially those based on neural networks. The NnEP pattern consists of the semi-automated steps, extracted from design experiences, a designer takes using the provided software suite to realize a NN application in an intelligent SoC. This includes the application analysis and pre-processing procedure, building the best-match IP core with the application, and finally compiling the intended NN application on the target IP core. On the other hand, ASIC \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.18\u03bcm</i>\n implementation results of NnSP soft core show that the core can achieve the speed of 51.2 GOPS, 25.6 GMAC/s. This throughput is comparable with the existing parallel solutions and higher in an order of magnitude from common general-purpose-processor-based solutions. This high throughput in conjunction with the inherent reusable architecture of NnSP, makes NnEP a powerful design pattern for cutting-edge neural-network-based embedded applications such as pattern recognition which is elaborated as a case study in the proposed design pattern.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286248/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9705831","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286248/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"NNEP, Design Pattern for Neural-Network-Based Embedded Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NNEP, Design Pattern for Neural-Network-Based Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Ciechocinek, Poland","sourcePdf":"MIXDES-00-142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068649S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4286105","isNumber":"4286106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286105","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4286106","articleId":"4286248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEETech Univ of Lodz Dept of Microelectronics & Computer Science","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4286321,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory D.

REM is envisioned to be an integrated database that consists of comprehensive multi-domain information for CR, such as geographical features, available services, spectral regulations, locations and activities of radio devices, policies, and past experiences. Disseminating and sharing REM information offers a proper vehicle of CR network support, which can be exploited by cognitive engine (CE) for most cognitive functionalities such as situation awareness, reasoning, learning, planning and decision support. Tradeoffs have to be made between the performance gain and the cost of overhead. This paper focuses on analyzing the overhead associated with REM dissemination under various scenarios. With analytical models and network simulations, it is shown that the overhead of REM dissemination can be significantly reduced by extending the optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR). Application-specific ad hoc methods have also been proposed and can be employed to further reduce the overhead. Simulations are presented, comparing the overhead of REM dissemination for different network size, topology, node density and mobility. Preliminary results show that the speed of wireless nodes has little impact to the load of overhead if the REM dissemination rate is fixed. The size of REM information element is estimated for the emerging cognitive wireless regional area networks (IEEE 802.22 WRAN).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286322/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286322/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Overhead Analysis for Radio Environment Mapenabled Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overhead Analysis for Radio Environment Mapenabled Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SDR-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087535S","chronDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4286310","isNumber":"4286311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286310","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4286311","articleId":"4286322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4286323,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis A.

We analyze the impact of stale channel feedback information on this rate and power allocation framework and demonstrate how matrix channel prediction using a Kalman-filter based, vector autoregressive model can alleviate this problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Defined Radio Demonstration of MIMO-OFDM Rate Adaptation","publicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/SDR.2006.4286326","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4286310/4286311/04286326.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDR.2006.4286326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Software Defined Radio Demonstration of MIMO-OFDM Rate Adaptation","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286326/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Defined Radio Demonstration of MIMO-OFDM Rate Adaptation","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SDR-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093534S","chronDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4286310","isNumber":"4286311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286310","xplore-issue":"4286311","articleId":"4286326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4286329,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Sharma","affiliation":["Departmennt of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085950918"},{"name":"Mohit Tiwari","affiliation":["Departmennt of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Mohit","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37410269700"},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","affiliation":["Departmennt of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, U.S.A"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37333494700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0733-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4286329","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"Essential to adaptive devices is the ability to reconfigure Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols to environment conditions and application requirements.

In spite of the great potential of such a radio platform, such \"public\" development threatens the success of these platforms: the proliferation of such wireless platforms, plus the open-source nature of their supporting software, is powerful but also dangerous. It is easily conceivable that inexpensive and widely available cognitive radios could become an ideal platform for abuse since the lowest layers of the wireless protocol stack are accessible to programmers. In order to regulate the future radio environment, this paper presents a framework, known as TRIESTE (Trusted Radio Infrastructure for Enforcing SpecTrum Etiquettes), which can ensure that radio devices are only able to access/use the spectrum in a manner that conforms to their privileges. In TRIESTE, two levels of etiquette enforcement mechanisms are employed. The first is an on-board mechanism that ensures trustworthy radio operation by restricting any potential violation operation from accessing the radio through a secure component located in each CR. External to individual cognitive radios, an infrastructure consisting of spectrum sensors monitors the radio environment, and reports measurements to spectrum police agents that punish CRs if violations are detected.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDR.2006.4286332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286311","publicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4286310/4286311/04286332.pdf","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRIESTE: A Trusted Radio Infrastructure for Enforcing SpecTrum Etiquettes","doi":"10.1109/SDR.2006.4286332","startPage":"101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"TRIESTE: A Trusted Radio Infrastructure for Enforcing SpecTrum Etiquettes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286332/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4286332/","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRIESTE: A Trusted Radio Infrastructure for Enforcing SpecTrum Etiquettes","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SDR-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045569S","chronDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4286310","isNumber":"4286311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286310","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4286311","articleId":"4286332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4286333,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiliang Chen","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ruiliang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290566300"},{"name":"Jung-Min Park","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jung-Min","lastName":"Park","id":"37293300400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0733-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4286333","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":174,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1118},"abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology that can alleviate the spectrum shortage problem by enabling unlicensed users equipped with CRs to coexist with incumbent users in licensed spectrum bands without inducing interference to incumbent communications. Spectrum sensing is one of the essential mechanisms of CRs that has attracted great attention from researhers recently. Although the operational aspects of spectrum sensing are being investigated actively, its security aspects have garnered little attention. In this paper, we describe an attack that poses a great threat to spectrum sensing. In this attack, which is called the primary user emulation (PUE) attack, an adversary's CR transmits signals whose characteristics emulate those of incumbent signals. The highly flexible, software-based air interface of CRs makes such an attack possible. Our investigation shows that a PUE attack can severely interfere with the spectrum sensing process and significantly reduce the channel resources available to legitimate unlicensed users. As a way of countering this threat, we propose a transmitter verification procedure that can be integrated into the spectrum sensing mechanism. The transmitter verification procedure employs a location verification scheme to distinguish incumbent signals from unlicensed signals masquerading as incumbent signals. Two alternative techniques are proposed to realize location verification: Distance Ratio Test and Distance Difference Test. We provide simulation results of the two techniques as well as analyses of their security in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4286310/4286311/04286333.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2006 1st IEEE Workshop on Networking Technologies for Software Defined Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/SDR.2006.4286333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDR.2006.4286333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring Trustworthy Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","FCC","White spaces","Security","Emulation","Radio transmitters","Testing","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Sensing","Primary User Emulation Attack","Location Verification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring Trustworthy Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2007","conferenceDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring Trustworthy Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SDR-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058865S","chronDate":"25-25 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4286310","isNumber":"4286311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286310","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"4286311","articleId":"4286333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4286362,"authors":[{"name":"Shahin Farshchi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Farshchi","id":"37424401800"},{"name":"Jack W.

In order to improve DRAM retention time characteristics, leakage current must be reduced and various solutions are proposed. The major leakage paths in a DRAM cell stem from reverse junction leakage from the storage node, and gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) current. Empirically it is known that the junction leakage is affected by the lateral electric field near the storage node, which is enhanced by an increase in substrate doping due to threshold adjustment. The DRAM cell becomes more susceptible to GIDL when the storage node stores a \"1\" and a negative bias is applied to the gate. The voltage drop across the gate oxide creates a vertical electric field that leads to a higher leakage current. In this paper, these leakage paths are investigated with device simulation. Tradeoffs between substrate doping, gate thickness and leakage are explored using Silvaco Atonable/Atlas. The DRAM cell was modeled using a 0.24 mum NMOS transistor. Substrate doping was varied to analyze its effect on depletion region, lateral electric field, and reverse current.

The simulations show that as the width of the gallium arsenide PCSS is reduced below 1.0 mum its dielectric breakdown field increases significantly, and at 0.1 mum the switch turn-off time is fast enough for 10.0 GHz amplifier operation. The Class AB OE amplifier based on a five-layer PCSS produced approximately 2.0 W of 10.0 GHz output power with approximately 50% efficiency. The Class E OE amplifier based on a single-layer PCSS produced approximately 86 mW output power with 56% efficiency.

The mode and standard selection is performed through a bias scheme (MOS switches) that allows alternating between the two involved standards. Good performances in terms of gain (S21 > 14.6dB), noise figure (NF ap 1.1dB) and input impedance matching (S11 < -26dB) were obtained.

In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous NoC as an alternative to match performance and energy requirements for dedicated applications. By employing an optimized mix of different routers, a heterogeneous network optimized for latency and energy consumption is achieved. A dedicated data structure, the application communication pattern (ACP), models the application, enabling the specification of the communication requirements among cores, together with their execution performance. ACP allows fast analysis, helping the system designer to evaluate the communication performance of a NoC-based system; this performance strongly depends on the placement of the cores, and it is computationally hard to find the optimal placement. An optimization algorithm mixes different router architectures $composing a heterogeneous NoC - and finds optimal placements for application cores. Therefore, a heterogeneous NoC can be achieved, which complies to the application requirements with minimum latency and energy, enabling one to obtain the Pareto curve relating latency and energy for a given application","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 18th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4286806/4286807/04286855.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"2005 18th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.2005.4286855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.2005.4286855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Space Exploration Comparing Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Network-on-Chip Architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Network-on-a-chip","Delay","Energy consumption","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Very large scale integration","Tiles","Scalability","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integrated circuit design","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration","network-on chip architecture","energy consumption","application communication pattern","optimization algorithm","application core","Pareto curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","Performance","Experimentation","Theory","Systems-on-Chip","Networks-on-Chip","Mapping and Optimization algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design Space Exploration Comparing Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Network-on-Chip Architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286855/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8690102","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Space Exploration Comparing Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Network-on-Chip Architectures","confLoc":"Florianopolis, Brazil","sourcePdf":"SBCCI-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050183S","chronDate":"4-7 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4286806","isNumber":"4286807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4286806","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4286807","articleId":"4286855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4286859,"authors":[{"name":"Alfredo Arnaud","affiliation":["Universidad de Cat\u00f3lica, Montevideo, Uruguay"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Arnaud","id":"37270155700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-174-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4286859","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"abstract":"In this paper, a chopper amplifier built with G\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n-C filters that are alternatively turned on and off will be introduced.

The proposed system does not perform explicit motion compensation but instead relies on the dual-tree transform to isolate moving features. Although the dual-tree transform is redundant, a noise-shaping process increases the sparsity of the transform coefficients, resulting in a high degree of spatiotemporally coherent regions of insignificant coefficients. The transform coefficients are coded with binary set-partitioning using k-d trees in an algorithm that exploits both within-subband spatiotemporal coherency as well as cross-subband correlation to achieve efficient coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other coders that also do not perform explicit motion estimation or compensation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Coding Using a Complex Wavelet Transform and Set Partitioning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4286934/04286935.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Coding Using a Complex Wavelet Transform and Set Partitioning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4286935/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608348","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Coding Using a Complex Wavelet Transform and Set Partitioning","sourcePdf":"14lsp09-boettcher.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050112S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4286934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4286934","articleId":"4286935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4286936,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Cao","affiliation":["BWC Laboratories, State Key Laboratories of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Cao","id":"37928727700"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["BWC Laboratories, State Key Laboratories of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Jiawei Yang","affiliation":["BWC Laboratories, State Key Laboratories of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280194100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4286936","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286936","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Filtering","Receiving antennas","Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Decorrelation","Multiaccess communication","Gaussian approximation","Signal analysis","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic data association","minimum-mean-square-error filtering","iterative soft decision interference cancellation","co-channel interference","V-BLAST systems","decorrelated signal model","MMSE-ISDIC detectors","uncoded systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative soft decision interference cancellation","MIMO","probabilistic data association","V-BLAST"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Relation Between PDA and MMSE-ISDIC","startPage":"597","endPage":"600","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4286934/04286936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896157","abstract":"The probabilistic data association (PDA) and the minimum-mean-square-error filtering based iterative soft decision interference cancellation (MMSE-ISDIC) are two popular detectors for systems with co-channel interference.

They have shown that the virtual receive antennas created by repeating the same transmit symbols several times can improve the outage rate of slow MIMO fading channels, especially if the number of transmit antennas is smaller than the number of receive antennas. Inspired by the RTM paper, we propose in this paper two channel-augmentation schemes having the same low complexity as the RTM scheme. In the first, the transmitted symbols are both repeated and complex conjugated leading to the conjugate virtual antenna (CVA) scheme. In the second, the transmitted symbols are constrained to be real-valued leading to the real virtual antenna (RVA) scheme. We show that the RTM, CVA, and RVA schemes can achieve a higher outage rate than the baseline scheme without augmentation for both V-BLAST and D-BLAST. The novel RVA and CVA schemes are seen to be more robust to channel correlation than the RTM scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4286934/04286939.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Novel Channel-Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286939/","displayDocTitle":"Two Novel Channel-Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","volume":"14","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9616047","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4286939/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Novel Channel-Augmentation Schemes for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"14lsp09-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075152S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4286934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"4286934","articleId":"4286939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4286940,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A possible solution is to select a subset of the available antennas at transmitter and/or receiver based on maximal capacity or minimal error rates. In this letter, we propose a receive antenna selection algorithm based on the minimization of the union bound on the vector error rate. By relaxing the antenna selection variables from discrete to continuous, we arrive at a convex optimization problem. Efficient numerical methods such as interior-point algorithms can be applied to solve this optimization problem with polynomial complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive Antenna Selection Based on Union-Bound Minimization Using Convex Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2007.896176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4286934/04286954.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2007.896176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4286954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286954/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Receive Antenna Selection Based on Union-Bound Minimization Using Convex Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4286954/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617803","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive Antenna Selection Based on Union-Bound Minimization Using Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"14lsp09-phan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057179S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4286934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4286934","articleId":"4286954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4286956,"authors":[{"name":"Zijian Tang","affiliation":["EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37289979400"},{"name":"Geert Leus","affiliation":["EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Leus","id":"38469519700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4286956","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Multiplexed Training for Time-Selective Channels","abstract":"Pilot-assisted channel estimation is considered in this letter, where the channel is assumed to be time-selective and can be accurately fit by a basis expansion model.

However, since the accuracy and the interpretability of the obtained model are contradictory properties, the necessity of improving the accuracy of the linguistic model arises when complex systems are modeled. To solve this problem, one of the research lines in recent years has led to the objective of giving more accuracy to linguistic fuzzy modeling without losing the interpretability to a high level. In this paper, a new postprocessing approach is proposed to perform an evolutionary lateral tuning of membership functions, with the main aim of obtaining linguistic models with higher levels of accuracy while maintaining good interpretability. To do so, we consider a new rule representation scheme base on the linguistic 2-tuples representation model which allows the lateral variation of the involved labels. Furthermore, the cooperation of the lateral tuning together with fuzzy rule reduction mechanisms is studied in this paper, presenting results on different real applications. The obtained results show the good performance of the proposed approach in high-dimensional problems and its ability to cooperate with methods to remove unnecessary rules.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889880","startPage":"616","endPage":"635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4286958/04286959.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proposal for the Genetic Lateral Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems and Its Interaction With Rule Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy logic","Humans","Knowledge based systems","Genetic algorithms","Modeling","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","fuzzy systems","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic lateral tuning","linguistic fuzzy system","rule selection","Linguistic fuzzy modeling","complex systems","evolutionary lateral tuning","membership function","rule representation","linguistic 2-tuples representation","fuzzy rule reduction","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy rule-based systems","genetic algorithms","interpretability","linguistic 2-tuples representation","rule selection","tuning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Proposal for the Genetic Lateral Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems and Its Interaction With Rule Selection","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4286959/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9618796","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposal for the Genetic Lateral Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems and Its Interaction With Rule Selection","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz04-alcala.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135753S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4286958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4286958","articleId":"4286959","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4286967,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["NCTU Branch, Brain Research Center, University System of Taiwan, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4286958/4286967/4286967-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng Lin (F'05) received the B.S. degree from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1992.","He is currently the Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dean of the Computer Science College, and Director of the Brain Research Center, NCTU.

Starting with a single linear control law, the controller structure is gradually refined during the evolution. Structural augmentation is intertwined with evolutionary adaptation of the additional parameters with the objective not only to improve the control performance but also to maximize the stability region of the nonlinear system. From the viewpoint of optimization the proposed method follows a divide-and-conquer approach. Additional rules and their parameters are introduced into the controller structure in a neutral fashion, such that the adaptations of the less complex controller in the previous stage are initially preserved. The proposed scheme is evaluated at the task of TSK fuzzy controller design for the upswing and stabilization of a rotational inverted pendulum. In the first case, the objective is a time optimal controller that upswings the pendulum in to the upper equilibrium point in shortest time. The stabilizing controller is designed as a state optimal controller. In a second application the optimization method is applied to the design of a fuzzy controller for vision-based mobile robot navigation. The results demonstrate that the incremental scheme generates solutions that are similar in control performance to pure parameter optimization of only the gains of a TSK system. Even more important, whereas direct optimization of control systems with more than 35 rules fails to identify a stabilizing control law, the incremental scheme optimizes fuzzy state-space partitions and gains for hundreds of rules.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.900905","startPage":"563","endPage":"577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.900905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4286958/04286970.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Evolutionary Design of TSK Fuzzy Controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286970/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incremental Evolutionary Design of TSK Fuzzy Controllers","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4286970/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9608347","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Evolutionary Design of TSK Fuzzy Controllers","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz04-hoffmann.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06947S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4286958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4286958","articleId":"4286970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4286974,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Mucientes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4286958/4286974/4286974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuel Mucientes received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Santiago de Compostela.

The proposed approach obtains a highly interpretable knowledge base in a very reduced time, and the designer only has to define the number of membership functions and the universe of discourse of each variable, together with a scoring function. In addition, the learned fuzzy controllers are general because the training set is composed of a number of automatically generated examples that cover the universe of discourse of each variable uniformly and with a predefined precision. The methodology has been applied to the design of a wall-following and moving object following behavior.

The proposed metric, the visual signal-to-noise ratio (VSNR), operates via a two-stage approach. In the first stage, contrast thresholds for detection of distortions in the presence of natural images are computed via wavelet-based models of visual masking and visual summation in order to determine whether the distortions in the distorted image are visible. If the distortions are below the threshold of detection, the distorted image is deemed to be of perfect visual fidelity (VSNR = infin)and no further analysis is required. If the distortions are suprathreshold, a second stage is applied which operates based on the low-level visual property of perceived contrast, and the mid-level visual property of global precedence. These two properties are modeled as Euclidean distances in distortion-contrast space of a multiscale wavelet decomposition, and VSNR is computed based on a simple linear sum of these distances. The proposed VSNR metric is generally competitive with current metrics of visual fidelity; it is efficient both in terms of its low computational complexity and in terms of its low memory requirements; and it operates based on physical luminances and visual angle (rather than on digital pixel values and pixel-based dimensions) to accommodate different viewing conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.901820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.901820","startPage":"2284","endPage":"2298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4286981/04286985.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VSNR: A Wavelet-Based Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Natural Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4286985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"VSNR: A Wavelet-Based Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Natural Images","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9607911","pubMedId":"17784602","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4286985/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VSNR: A Wavelet-Based Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Natural Images","sourcePdf":"16tip09-chandler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123551S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4286981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"790","xplore-issue":"4286981","articleId":"4286985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4286995,"authors":[{"name":"Thommen Korah","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Thommen Korah (S'05) received the B.Tech. degree in computer engineering from the Cochin University of Science and Technology, India, in 2001.

However, when such areas are occluded in the majority of camera views, appearance information from other visible portions of the facade provides a critical cue to correctly complete the mosaic. In this paper, we apply a robust measure of spread to infer whether a particular mosaic pixel is occluded in a majority of views, and introduce a novel spatiotemporal timeline-based inpainting algorithm that uses appearance and motion cues in order to fill the texture map in majority-occluded regions. We describe methods for automatically training appearance-based classifiers from a coarse motion-based segmentation to efficiently recognize foreground and background patches in static imagery.

As a consequence, humans are used to integrate at each instant perceptions from all their senses in order to enrich their understanding of the surrounding world. This paradigm can be also extremely useful in many signal processing and computer vision problems involving mutually related signals. The simultaneous processing of multimodal data can, in fact, reveal information that is otherwise hidden when considering the signals independently. However, in natural multimodal signals, the statistical dependencies between modalities are in general not obvious. Learning fundamental multimodal patterns could offer deep insight into the structure of such signals. In this paper, we present a novel model of multimodal signals based on their sparse decomposition over a dictionary of multimodal structures. An algorithm for iteratively learning multimodal generating functions that can be shifted at all positions in the signal is proposed, as well. The learning is defined in such a way that it can be accomplished by iteratively solving a generalized eigenvector problem, which makes the algorithm fast, flexible, and free of user-defined parameters. The proposed algorithm is applied to audiovisual sequences and it is able to discover underlying structures in the data. The detection of such audio-video patterns in audiovisual clips allows to effectively localize the sound source on the video in presence of substantial acoustic and visual distractors, outperforming state-of-the-art audiovisual localization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.901813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4286981/04287000.pdf","startPage":"2272","endPage":"2283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.901813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287000/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Multimodal Dictionaries","volume":"16","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610100","pubMedId":"17784601","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4287000/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Multimodal Dictionaries","sourcePdf":"16tip09-monaci.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119717S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4286981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4286981","articleId":"4287000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4287001,"authors":[{"name":"Robert L.

To help formalize the understanding of metric-based SAR autofocus methods, and to gain more insight into their performance, we present a theoretical analysis of these techniques using simple image models. Specifically, we consider the intensity-squared metric, and a dominant point-targets image model, and derive expressions for the resulting objective function. We examine the conditions under which the perfectly focused image models correspond to stationary points of the objective function. A key contribution is that we demonstrate formally, for the specific case of intensity-squared minimization autofocus, the mechanism by which metric-based methods utilize the multichannel defocusing model of SAR autofocus to enforce the stationary point property for multiple image columns. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the objective function has a special separble property through which it can be well approximated locally by a sum of 1-D functions of each phase error component. This allows fast performance through solving a sequence of 1-D optimization problems for each phase component simultaneously. Simulation results using the proposed models and actual SAR imagery confirm that the analysis extends well to realistic situations.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.903252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4286981/04287001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.903252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286981","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Image Autofocus By Sharpness Optimization: A Theoretical Study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAR Image Autofocus By Sharpness Optimization: A Theoretical Study","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9620495","pubMedId":"17784604","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Image Autofocus By Sharpness Optimization: A Theoretical Study","sourcePdf":"16tip09-morrison.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05414S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4286981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"84","articleId":"4287001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4287006,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Perreault","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Systems Laboratory, \u00e9Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Perreault","id":"37600283800"},{"name":"Patrick Hebert","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Systems Laboratory, \u00e9Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hebert","id":"37266194200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"4287006","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":194,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2106},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Kernel","Histograms","Image processing","Filtering algorithms","Runtime","Pressing","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","filtering theory","image processing","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["median filtering algorithm","image processing","algorithmic runtime complexity","filter kernel radius"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","complexity theory","image processing","median filters"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Graphics","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Time Factors","User-Computer Interface"]}],"abstract":"The median filter is one of the basic building blocks in many image processing situations.

A well-known color constancy method is based on the gray-world assumption which assumes that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy namely the gray-edge hypothesis, which assumes that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources. The experiments show that the proposed color constancy algorithms obtain comparable results as the state-of-the-art color constancy methods with the merit of being computationally more efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.901808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4286981/04287009.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4286981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.901808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"2207","endPage":"2214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge-Based Color Constancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Edge-Based Color Constancy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287009/","volume":"16","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4287009/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608345","pubMedId":"17784594","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge-Based Color Constancy","sourcePdf":"16tip09-vandeweijer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085257S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4286981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"482","xplore-issue":"4286981","articleId":"4287009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4287121,"authors":[{"name":"Barbara A.

Of the 6435 student respondents, 4349 (68%) reported working in teams. Relative to the students who only worked individually, the students who worked in teams were significantly more likely to agree that the course had achieved its stated learning objectives (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that roughly one-quarter of the variance in belief about whether the objectives were met could be explained by four factors: 1) student satisfaction with the team experience; 2) the presence of instructor guidance related to teamwork; 3) the presence of slackers on teams; and 4) team size. Pearson product-moment correlations revealed statistically significant associations between agreement that the course objectives had been fulfilled and the use of student teams and between satisfaction with teams and the occurrences of instructor guidance on teamwork skills. These and other results suggest that assigning work to student teams can lead to learning benefits and student satisfaction, provided that the instructor pays attention to how the teams and the assignments are set up.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4287121/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9617778","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Best Practices Involving Teamwork in the Classroom: Results From a Survey of 6435 Engineering Student Respondents","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best Practices Involving Teamwork in the Classroom: Results From a Survey of 6435 Engineering Student Respondents","sourcePdf":"50te03-oakley.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104699S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"4287102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4287102","articleId":"4287121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4287125,"authors":[{"name":"Trini Sansaloni","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Grau de Gandia, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Trini Sansaloni received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Grao de Gandia, Spain, in 1994 and 2001, respectively.","She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronics at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.

The structure and methodology used in the proposed course are oriented to the design and implementation of an fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analyzer. This application covers most topics included in a DSP course and gives better results that those obtained with typical courses performing independent multiple simple experiments. The project is divided into modules that show specific learning necessities and determine the course contents and organization. Each laboratory part is dedicated to design and implements the block of the analyzer related to the theoretical content presented in the class. At the end of the course the students have designed all the pieces in the DSP project and have completed and verified the system. The used methodology enables students and engineers to understand and develop complex fixed-point applications, looking for the best signal processing algorithms on hardware implementations, and also results in more motivated and active students.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","startPage":"229","endPage":"235","doi":"10.1109/TE.2007.900025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2007.900025","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/4287102/04287125.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FFT Spectrum Analyzer Project for Teaching Digital Signal Processing With FPGA Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287125/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"FFT Spectrum Analyzer Project for Teaching Digital Signal Processing With FPGA Devices","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618776","volume":"50","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4287125/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FFT Spectrum Analyzer Project for Teaching Digital Signal Processing With FPGA Devices","sourcePdf":"50te03-sansaloni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051561S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"4287102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4287102","articleId":"4287125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4287126,"authors":[{"name":"Richard H.

The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory-Tracking and Path-Following of Underactuated Autonomous Vehicles With Parametric Modeling Uncertainty","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.902731","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4287128/04287130.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.902731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory-Tracking and Path-Following of Underactuated Autonomous Vehicles With Parametric Modeling Uncertainty","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4287130/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608320","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory-Tracking and Path-Following of Underactuated Autonomous Vehicles With Parametric Modeling Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"52tac08-aguiar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115257S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4287128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"564","xplore-issue":"4287128","articleId":"4287130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4287133,"authors":[{"name":"Julio H.

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints are one way in which data-rate limits arise, and are the focus of this paper. In both continuous and discrete-time settings, we show that there are limitations on the ability to stabilize an unstable plant over a SNR constrained channel using finite-dimensional linear time invariant (LTI) feedback. In the case of state feedback, or output feedback with a delay-free, minimum phase plant, these limitations in fact match precisely those that might have been inferred by considering the associated ideal Shannon capacity data rate over the same channel. In the case of LTI output feedback, additional limitations are shown to apply if the plant is nonminimum phase. In this case, we show that for a continuous-time nonminimum phase plant, a periodic linear time varying feedback scheme with fast sampling may be used to recover the original SNR requirement at the cost of robustness properties. The proposed framework inherently captures channel noise effects in a simple formulation suited to conventional LTI control performance and robustness analysis, and has potential to handle time delays and bandwidth constraints in a variety of control over communication links problems.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.902739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4287128/04287133.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.902739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback Stabilization Over Signal-to-Noise Ratio Constrained Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287133/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback Stabilization Over Signal-to-Noise Ratio Constrained Channels","volume":"52","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9608321","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4287133/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback Stabilization Over Signal-to-Noise Ratio Constrained Channels","sourcePdf":"52tac08-braslavsky.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083339S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4287128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"304","xplore-issue":"4287128","articleId":"4287133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4287138,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsheng Du","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Physics, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Du","id":"37532504100"},{"name":"Bin Jiang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37334106700"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Shaosheng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Shaosheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37290516600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4287138","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":153,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1226},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"In this note, the problem of H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n filtering for a class of discrete-time switched systems with state delays is investigated.

In the worst-case setting, a function of state termed barrier certificate is used to certify that all trajectories of the system starting from a given initial set do not enter an unsafe region. No explicit computation of reachable sets is required in the construction of barrier certificates, which makes it possible to handle nonlinearity, uncertainty, and constraints directly within this framework. In the stochastic setting, our method computes an upper bound on the probability that a trajectory of the system reaches the unsafe set, a bound whose validity is proven by the existence of a barrier certificate. For polynomial systems, barrier certificates can be constructed using convex optimization, and hence the method is computationally tractable. Some examples are provided to illustrate the use of the method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4287128/04287147.pdf","startPage":"1415","endPage":"1428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2007.902736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2007.902736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Worst-Case and Stochastic Safety Verification Using Barrier Certificates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Piecewise linear approximation","Stochastic systems","Nonlinear systems","Air safety","Safety devices","Uncertainty","Upper bound","Polynomials","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous systems","control nonlinearities","convex programming","nonlinear control systems","probability","stochastic systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["safety verification","worst-case setting","stochastic setting","barrier certificates","continuous system","hybrid system","control nonlinearities","probability","polynomial system","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Barrier certificates","hybrid systems","nonlinear systems","safety verification","stochastic systems","sum of squares optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Worst-Case and Stochastic Safety Verification Using Barrier Certificates","volume":"52","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4287147/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9606487","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Worst-Case and Stochastic Safety Verification Using Barrier Certificates","sourcePdf":"52tac08-prajna.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115142S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4287128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"4287128","articleId":"4287147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4287154,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichun Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Operational Research and Systems Engineering, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhichun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406197100"},{"name":"Daoyi Xu","affiliation":["Yangtze Center of Mathematics, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Daoyi","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536622500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4287154","dbTime":"57 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":237,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2083},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Control systems","Delay effects","Communication system control","Delay systems","Medical control systems","Chaotic communication","Communication systems","Time varying systems","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","convergence","delay systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","impulsive control systems","time-varying delays","impulsive delay differential inequality","global exponential stability","exponential convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential stability","impulsive control","impulsive delay differential inequalities","time delay"]}],"abstract":"A class of impulsive control systems with time-varying delays is considered.

The amelioration of powerful multicarrier OFDM arrangements with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has numerous benefits, which are detailed in this treatise. We continue by highlighting the limitations of conventional detection and channel estimation techniques designed for multiuser MIMO OFDM systems in the so-called rank-deficient scenarios, where the number of users supported or the number of transmit antennas employed exceeds the number of receiver antennas. This is often encountered in practice, unless we limit the number of users granted access in the base station's or radio port's coverage area. Following a historical perspective on the associated design problems and their state-of-the-art solutions, the second half of this treatise details a range of classic multiuser detectors (MUDs) designed for MIMO-OFDM systems and characterizes their achievable performance. A further section aims for identifying novel cutting-edge genetic algorithm (GA)-aided detector solutions, which have found numerous applications in wireless communications in recent years. In an effort to stimulate the cross pollination of ideas across the machine learning, optimization, signal processing, and wireless communications research communities, we will review the broadly applicable principles of various GA-assisted optimization techniques, which were recently proposed also for employment in multiuser MIMO OFDM. In order to stimulate new research, we demonstrate that the family of GA-aided MUDs is capable of achieving a near-optimum performance at the cost of a significantly lower computational complexity than that imposed by their optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) MUD aided counterparts. The paper is concluded by outlining a range of future research options that may find their way into next-generation wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.898869","startPage":"1430","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4287191/04287201.pdf","endPage":"1469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2007.898869","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287201/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO-OFDM for Next-Generation Wireless Systems","volume":"95","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4287201/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9610078","publicationDate":"July 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO-OFDM for Next-Generation Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"95jproc07-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.384462S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4287191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"4287191","articleId":"4287201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4287203,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Morelli","id":"37273534500"},{"name":"C.-C.

Even though the OFDMA concept is simple in its basic principle, the design of a practical OFDMA system is far from being a trivial task. Synchronization represents one of the most challenging issues and plays a major role in the physical layer design. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the latest results in the field of synchronization for OFDMA systems, with tutorial objectives foremost. After quantifying the effects of synchronization errors on the system performance, we review some common methods to achieve timing and frequency alignment in a downlink transmission. We then consider the uplink case, where synchronization is made particularly difficult by the fact that each user's signal is characterized by different timing and frequency errors, and the base station has thus to estimate a relatively large number of unknown parameters. A second difficulty is related to how the estimated parameters must be employed to correct the uplink timing and frequency errors. The paper concludes with a comparison of the reviewed synchronization schemes in an OFDMA scenario inspired by the IEEE 802.16 standard for wireless metropolitan area networks.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2007.897979","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

In this paper, we consider channel estimation issue in a MIMO-OFDM system using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes at transmitter and iterative detection based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator and a soft LDPC decoder at receiver. We first consider a previously proposed solution based on least-square estimator (USE). Since matrix inversion is required in LSE algorithms, their computational cost for implementation is high. Then, we resort to the expectation-maximization (EM)-type algorithms, which significantly reduce the complexity of the channel estimation, and propose a modified turbo receiver for LDPC-coded MIMO-OFDM systems which performs the channel estimation by space alternating generalized EM (SAGE) algorithm. Based on simulation results, the performance of the proposed receiver is quite satisfying.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE.2007.4287296","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287279/4287280/04287296.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE.2007.4287296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for MIMO Turbo Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287296/","displayDocTitle":"EM-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for MIMO Turbo Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9781708","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4287296/","conferenceDate":"11-12 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-Based Channel Estimation Algorithms for MIMO Turbo Receivers","confLoc":"Lahore, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICEE-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056292S","chronDate":"11-12 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287279","isNumber":"4287280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287279","xplore-issue":"4287280","articleId":"4287296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4287307,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

LSE estimation is considered as a convenient method for parameter estimation, in comparison with this proposed method. Despite of LSE estimation that is based on the linearity of error function due to parameters, GA method can easily identify unknown parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors. GA is imported in comparison with conventional optimization methods because of its power in searching entire solution space with more probability of finding the global optimum. Also the model can be nonlinear with respect to parameters, and in this identification free noise system is assumed and transient excitation is considered instead of persistent excitation. Finally comparison between LSE and GA optimization is presented to indicate robustness and resolution of GA identification method in parameter estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ICEE.2007.4287313","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287279/4287280/04287313.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE.2007.4287313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Estimation Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm Applied to DC Motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Genetic algorithms","DC motors","Optimization methods","Parametric statistics","Least squares approximation","State estimation","Recursive estimation","System identification","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC motors","genetic algorithms","least mean squares methods","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation optimization","genetic algorithm","DC motor","LSE estimation","error function","sum of squared errors","transient excitation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Estimation Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm Applied to DC Motor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4287313/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"11-12 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9781724","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Estimation Optimization Based on Genetic Algorithm Applied to DC Motor","confLoc":"Lahore, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICEE-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068124S","chronDate":"11-12 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287279","isNumber":"4287280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287279","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4287280","articleId":"4287313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4287350,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A solution has been proposed in literature, which involves replacing DFT with wavelet packet transform (WPT) in communication systems. WPT does not require CP and has the attraction of having much lower side lobes. However, in wavelet based multicarrier systems, channel equalization remains an open research area. In this article, a time-domain zero-forcing equalizer (ZFE) for wavelet packet based OFDM (WOFDM) is proposed. The performance comparison of DFT-OFDM and WOFDM is given for an arbitrary FIR channel with different types of wavelet packets.

The less the transform length is, the more butterfly units are used, the more cycles the butterfly units cost, the more possibility of RAW dependency lurks. In this paper, taking radix-2 time decimation FFT processors for example, we define the minimum slack cycles for each stage, which provides a quantitative method to identify RAW dependencies in FFT processors of variable transform length, and put forward some proposals to reduce or erase RAW dependencies. The minimum slack cycles also indicates the numbers of waiting cycles should be inserted into each stage, which simplifies the design of control path in FFT processors. As to the situation of multiple butterfly units and high-radix structure, same ideas can be used.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2007.48","publicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287452/4287453/04287480.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2007.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287453","startPage":"88","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the RAW Dependency in Floating-point FFT Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on the RAW Dependency in Floating-point FFT Processors","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287480/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868201","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4287480/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the RAW Dependency in Floating-point FFT Processors","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"290910088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041444S","chronDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287452","isNumber":"4287453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287452","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4287453","articleId":"4287480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4287499,"authors":[{"name":"Fasheng Xu","affiliation":["School of Science, Jinan University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Fasheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37830715400"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["School of Information, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37558247200"},{"name":"Ling Yang","affiliation":["School of Information, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Yang","id":"37879357300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4287499","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Portfolios","Heuristic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Security","Cost function","Simulated annealing","Software engineering","Artificial intelligence","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["investment","nonlinear programming","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","realistic portfolio selection problem","standard Markowitz model","heuristic algorithm","nonlinear programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287499","abstract":"In this paper, the realistic portfolio selection problem is studied and an algorithm named improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is presented to solve this problem.

In addition, due to these complex constraints traditional optimization algorithms fail to work efficiently and heuristic algorithms can be the best method, so we present an improved particle swarm optimization to solve our problem.

A novel algorithm of attribute reduction based on parallel particle swarm optimization is proposed, which can significantly reduce execution time for complex large-scale data sets. This algorithm constructs heuristic information from the viewpoint of information theory, combines genetic idea and tabu operators with particle swarm optimization (PSO), redefines the updating process of particle swarm, and introduces the parallel strategy based on master-slave model with coarse grain in constructing the parallel PSO architecture. It maintains diversity of particles, which avoids the premature problem and restrains the degeneration phenomenon, and enhances the efficiency of attribute reduction.

It is the same for the distributed video coding (DVC), which can be thought to consist of a quantizer followed by a Slepian-Wolf encoder. The quantizer has dominant effect on the quality of the reconstructed video. In this context, this paper proposes quantization scheme for DVC based on a modified Lloyd-Max algorithm. The reconstruction values and partitions of quantizer are designed online for each Wyner-Ziv frame. The training set is extracted from the previous frame and a corresponding correlation model is computed respectively in the encoder and decoder. It is shown that at the cost of a slight higher error rate of the turbo code, the simple nonuniform quantization scheme will lower the quantization error in the reconstruction step, and on the whole improve the rate distortion performance.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2007.136","publicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287452/4287453/04287621.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2007.136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lloyd-Max-based Non-Uniform Quantization Scheme for Distributed Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287621/","displayDocTitle":"A Lloyd-Max-based Non-Uniform Quantization Scheme for Distributed Video Coding","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868342","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4287621/","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lloyd-Max-based Non-Uniform Quantization Scheme for Distributed Video Coding","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"290910848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057656S","chronDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287452","isNumber":"4287453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287452","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4287453","articleId":"4287621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4287647,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087208198"},{"name":"Zhen-wu Wang","affiliation":["China University of Petroleum, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-wu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087206910"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4287647","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Particle swarm optimization","Quality of service","Switches","Genetic algorithms","Software engineering","Availability","Artificial intelligence","Distributed computing","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web services composition","QoS","discrete particle swarm optimization","rapid convergence speed","quality of service","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DPSO","QoS","web services composition","GAs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287647","abstract":"The discrete particle swarm optimization (DTSO) has many merits, for example simple, rapid convergence speed.

resistance strain gauge force transducers used in vehicle traction force measurements. A data fusion method based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network is proposed to reduce the negative effects and compensate the measurement error. A multiquadrics kernel is utilized as the kernel function for the RBF neural networks. It fuses the environmental temperature in the force measurement while realizing an accurate compensation of errors.

One major feature of the prosody of Mandarin Chinese speech flow is prosodic phrase grouping. In this paper three methods are proposed to predict prosodic phrase. The first is a statistic probability model, which efficiently combines the local POS and word length information. Experiments show by choosing appropriate threshold the model can reach a high precision and high recall ratio. Secondly we use the decision tree learning algorithm combined with the pause rules of Chinese empty words to predict prosodic phrase boundary in unrestricted Chinese text.

Further syntactic analysis is based on the output of word segmentation result. Ambiguity and unregistered words are the most important problems in Chinese word segmentation. In this paper we analyzed the ambiguous reasons and presented a one-pass scan method for the detection and modification of ambiguous cases. To deal with the unregistered words and special words (such as names), we proposed a combination method that can recognize new words, hence the accuracy can be increased. In the realization, we used the bisection search method to look up words in a large dictionary (more than 40,000 items), and the average search cost for a word is less than 16 operations, so the speed is satisfactory if the system is embedded into Chinese understanding systems or Chinese speech processing systems.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2007.319","publicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287452/4287802/04287947.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2007.319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287802","startPage":"738","endPage":"743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combining Approach for Chinese Word Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Combining Approach for Chinese Word Segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287947/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868483","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4287947/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combining Approach for Chinese Word Segmentation","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"290930738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028027S","chronDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287452","isNumber":"4287802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287452","xplore-issue":"4287802","articleId":"4287947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4287997,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Ye","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Ye","id":"37566936800"},{"name":"Hongxu Cui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongxu","lastName":"Cui","id":"37555976100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2909-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4287997","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4287997","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference constraints","GSM","Ground penetrating radar","Cellular networks","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Electromagnetic interference","Electromagnetic compatibility and interference","Electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","code division multiple access","data mining","graph theory","matrix algebra","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reuse pattern mining","CDMA cellular mobile network optimization","electromagnetic interference minimization","channel separation constraints","geometric constraints","channel assignment","subgraph mining","RCAP scheme","reuse-pattern-oriented CAP model","separation matrix"]}],"abstract":"CAP, a classical problem in cellular mobile communication networks such as GSM/GPRS or CDMA cellular mobile networks, refers to assigning a limited number of available channels to many mobile voice or data users while minimizing electromagnetic interferences. Most existing researches on CAP focus mainly on channel separation constraints, but pay little attention to geometric constraints defined by reuse patterns that is of great value in engineering applications. An extended CAP model named RCAP (reuse-pattern-oriented CAP) is proposed, which takes account of both of these two constraints. A systematic solution to RCAP is elaborated, which includes two sequential steps, i.e., partition of reuse groups and channel assignment in the groups. Partition of reuse groups is reduced to subgraph isomorphism and can be tackled by subgraph mining while channel assignment in groups is solved in a heuristic manner. The effectiveness of RCAP and its solution was verified by three benchmarks. RCAP was applied to PN offsets assignment in the CDMA networks in several cities of Liaoning Province, and a case study is illustrated in the paper. These results indicate that the proposed RCAP scheme is a very promising solution to channel assignment problems in practical CDMA networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2007.448","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2007.448","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4287452/4287802/04287997.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1016","publicationTitle":"Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4287802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining of Reuse Patterns in CDMA Network Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mining of Reuse Patterns in CDMA Network Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4287997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9868533","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4287997/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining of Reuse Patterns in CDMA Network Optimization","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"290931011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135845S","chronDate":"July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4287452","isNumber":"4287802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4287452","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4287802","articleId":"4287997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4288038,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer English","affiliation":["University of Alabama, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jennifer English is an associate professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

Basecalling, the procedure that determines the sequence of bases from the given electropherogram can then be performed using the Viterbi algorithm. A training step is required prior to basecalling in order to estimate the HMM parameters. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach which employs the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to perform basecalling. Such an approach not only allows one to naturally encode the prior biological knowledge into the basecalling algorithm, it also exploits both the training data and the basecalling data in estimating the HMM parameters, leading to more accurate estimates. Using the recently sequenced genome of the organism Legionella pneumophila, we show that the MCMC basecaller outperforms the state-of-the-art basecalling algorithm in terms of total errors while requiring much less training than other proposed statistical basecallers.","doi":"10.1109/tcbb.2007.1027","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/4288057/04288068.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2007.1027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Basecalling for DNA Sequence Analysis Using Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288068/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Basecalling for DNA Sequence Analysis Using Hidden Markov Models","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9945768","pubMedId":"17666762","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288068/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Basecalling for DNA Sequence Analysis Using Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"n0430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060921S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"4288057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4288057","articleId":"4288068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288070,"authors":[{"name":"Gergely Korodi","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Gergely","lastName":"Korodi","id":"37297781000"},{"name":"Ioan Tabus","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Tabus","id":"37267482300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5963"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9964"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0043"}],"articleNumber":"4288070","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":213},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-nns.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sequences","Genomics","Bioinformatics","DNA","Humans","Organisms","Feature extraction","Biological cells","Decision making","Planets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","decision making","DNA","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annotated nucleotide sequences","DNA files","grammar parser","decision-making","Markovian dependencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["4 [Data]: Coding and Information Theory | Data compaction and compression","F.4 [Theory of Computation]: Mathematical Logic and Formal Languages | Formal languages","G.3 [Mathematics of Computing]: Probability and Statistics | Markov processes","J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciences | Biology and genetics","Annotation","Compression","Formal Grammars","Nucleotide sequences"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Base Sequence","DNA","DNA","DNA","Data Compression","Databases, Genetic","Documentation","Molecular Sequence Data","Natural Language Processing","Sequence Analysis, DNA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/tcbb.2007.1017","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8857/4288057/04288070.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2007.1017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression of Annotated Nucleotide Sequences","abstract":"This paper introduces an algorithm for the lossless compression of DNA files which contain annotation text besides the nucleotide sequence. First, a grammar is specifically designed to capture the regularities of the annotation text. A revertible transformation uses the grammar rules in order to equivalently represent the original file as a collection of parsed segments and a sequence of decisions made by the grammar parser. This decomposition enables the efficient use of state-of-the-art encoders for processing the parsed segments. The output size of the decision-making process of the grammar is optimized by extending the states to account for high-order Markovian dependencies. The practical implementation of the algorithm achieves a significant improvement when compared to the general-purpose methods currently used for DNA files.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9692393","pubMedId":"17666764","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288070/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compression of Annotated Nucleotide Sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of Annotated Nucleotide Sequences","sourcePdf":"n0447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044406S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2007","isNumber":"4288057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4288070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288072,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Also, as overfitting is likely to occur in microarray data because of their small sample set, a point injection technique is developed to address the problem of overfitting. The proposed strategies have been evaluated on three kinds of cancer diagnosis. Our results show that the proposed strategies can improve the performance of gene selection substantially.

Here, we present results that suggest that preclustering of small molecules prior to neural network optimization is useful for generating models of quantitative structure-activity relationships for a set of HIV inhibitors. Using these methods, it is possible to prescreen compounds to separate active from inactive compounds or even active and mildly active compounds from inactive compounds with high predictive accuracy while simultaneously reducing the feature space.

We investigate the susceptibility to TFs of all latch nodes and identify the most critical one(s). We show that, for standard latches using back-to-back inverters for their positive feedback, the internal nodes within their feedback path are the most critical. Such nodes will be hereafter referred to as internal feedback nodes. Based on this analysis, we first propose a low-cost hardened latch that, compared to alternative hardened solutions, is able to completely filter out TFs affecting its internal feedback nodes while presenting a lower susceptibility to TFs on the other internal nodes. This is achieved at the cost of a reduced robustness to TFs affecting the output node. To overcome this possible limitation (especially for systems for high-reliability applications), we propose another version of our latch that, at the cost of a small area and power consumption increase compared to our first solution, also improves the robustness of the output node, which can be higher than that of alternative hardened solutions. Additionally, both proposed latches present a comparable or higher robustness of the input node than alternative solutions and provide a lower or comparable power-delay product and area overhead than classical implementations and alternative hardened solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4288079/04288092.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latch Susceptibility to Transient Faults and New Hardening Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Latch Susceptibility to Transient Faults and New Hardening Approach","volume":"56","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9612665","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288092/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latch Susceptibility to Transient Faults and New Hardening Approach","sourcePdf":"t1255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114395S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4288079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4288079","articleId":"4288092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288093,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Sakiyama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ESAT/SCD-COSIC, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4288079/4288093/4288093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuo Sakiyama received the BEng and MEng degrees in electrical engineering from Osaka University, Japan, in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and the MS degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

The supported field size can be arbitrary up to a(n + 1) - 1. The superscaling feature is facilitated by defining a single instruction that can be used for all field operations and point/divisor operations. In addition, the cryptoprocessor is fully programmable and it can handle various curve parameters and arbitrary irreducible polynomials. The cost, performance, and security trade-offs are thoroughly discussed for different hardware configurations and software programs. The synthesis results with a 0.13-mum CMOS technology show that the proposed reconfigurable cryptoprocessor runs at 292 MHz, whereas the field sizes can be supported up to 587 bits. The compact and fastest configuration of our design is also synthesized with a fixed field size and irreducible polynomial. The results show that the scalar multiplication of ECC over GF(2163) and HECC over GF(283) can be performed in 29 and 63 mus, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.1071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4288079/04288093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.1071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288079","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicore Curve-Based Cryptoprocessor with Reconfigurable Modular Arithmetic Logic Units over GF(2^n)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multicore Curve-Based Cryptoprocessor with Reconfigurable Modular Arithmetic Logic Units over GF(2^n)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9616539","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288093/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicore Curve-Based Cryptoprocessor with Reconfigurable Modular Arithmetic Logic Units over GF(2^n)","sourcePdf":"t1269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089147S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4288079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4288079","articleId":"4288093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288102,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehyuk Huh","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4288098/4288102/4288102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaehyuk Huh received the BS degree from Seoul National University in 1996 and the PhD degree in computer sciences from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.

The L2 cache is organized as a nonuniform cache architecture (NUCA) array with a switched network embedded in it for high performance. We show that this organization can support a spectrum of degrees of sharing: unshared, in which each processor owns a private portion of the cache, thus reducing hit latency, and completely shared, in which every processor shares the entire cache, thus minimizing misses, and every point in between. We measure the optimal degree of sharing for different cache bank mapping policies and also evaluate a per-application cache partitioning strategy. We conclude that a static NUCA organization with sharing degrees of 2 or 4 works best across a suite of commercial and scientific parallel workloads. We demonstrate that migratory dynamic NUCA approaches improve performance significantly for a subset of the workloads at the cost of increased complexity, especially as per-application cache partitioning strategies are applied. We also evaluate the energy efficiency of each design point in terms of network traffic, bank accesses, and external memory accesses.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4288098/04288102.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288098","startPage":"1028","endPage":"1040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A NUCA Substrate for Flexible CMP Cache Sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A NUCA Substrate for Flexible CMP Cache Sharing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9612599","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288102/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A NUCA Substrate for Flexible CMP Cache Sharing","sourcePdf":"l1028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128482S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4288098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"4288098","articleId":"4288102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288104,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Chaparro","affiliation":["Intel Barcelona Research Center, Intel Laboratories, UPC, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4288098/4288104/4288104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedro Chaparro received the MS degree in computer science and computer engineering in January 2003 from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona.

The main reason is that multicore designs provide an effective way of overcoming instruction-level parallelism (ILP) limitations by exploiting thread-level parallelism (TLP). In addition, it is a power and complexity-effective way of taking advantage of the huge number of transistors that can be integrated on a chip. On the other hand, today's higher than ever power densities have made temperature one of the main limitations of microprocessor evolution. Thermal management in multicore architectures is a fairly new area. Some works have addressed dynamic thermal management in bi/quad-core architectures. This work provides insight and explores different alternatives for thermal management in multicore architectures with 16 cores. Schemes employing both energy reduction and activity migration are explored and improvements for thread migration schemes are proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the Thermal Implications of Multi-Core Architectures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1092","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4288098/04288104.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the Thermal Implications of Multi-Core Architectures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4288104/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9621329","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the Thermal Implications of Multi-Core Architectures","sourcePdf":"l1055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150912S","chronDate":"Aug.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4288098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4288098","articleId":"4288104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288126,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4288116/4288126/4288126-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiguo Liu received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from Xi\u2019an JiaoTong University, China, in 1998 and 2002 and the PhD degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2006.

Typical alignment operations consist of finding similarities between a pair of sequences (pairwise sequence alignment) or a family of sequences (multiple sequence alignment). The need for speeding up this treatment comes from the rapid growth rate of biological sequence databases: every year their size increases by a factor of 1.5 to 2. In this paper, we present a new approach to high-performance biological sequence alignment based on commodity PC graphics hardware. Using modern graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-performance computing is facilitated by their enhanced programmability and motivated by their attractive price/performance ratio and incredible growth in speed. To derive an efficient mapping onto this type of architecture, we have reformulated dynamic-programming-based alignment algorithms as streaming algorithms in terms of computer graphics primitives. Our experimental results show that the GPU-based approach allows speedups of more than one order of magnitude with respect to optimized CPU implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9676840","htmlLink":"/document/4288126/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Streaming Algorithms for Biological Sequence Alignment on GPUs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streaming Algorithms for Biological Sequence Alignment on GPUs","sourcePdf":"l1270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083286S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4288116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4288116","articleId":"4288126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288144,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4288134/4288144/4288144-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Yuan received the BE degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 1998 and the MSc and PhD degrees from the University of Queensland, Queensland, Austra-lia, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.

The goal is to find the optimal segmentation that minimizes the overall coding length of the segmented data, subject to a given distortion. By analyzing the coding length/rate of mixed data, we formally establish some strong connections of data segmentation to many fundamental concepts in lossy data compression and rate-distortion theory. We show that a deterministic segmentation is approximately the (asymptotically) optimal solution for compressing mixed data. We propose a very simple and effective algorithm that depends on a single parameter, the allowable distortion. At any given distortion, the algorithm automatically determines the corresponding number and dimension of the groups and does not involve any parameter estimation. Simulation results reveal intriguing phase-transition-like behaviors of the number of segments when changing the level of distortion or the amount of outliers.

Our work attempts to elucidate (1) whether a textlike bag-of-visterms (BOV) representation (histogram of quantized local visual features) is suitable for scene (rather than object) classification, (2) whether some analogies between discrete scene representations and text documents exist, and 3) whether unsupervised, latent space models can be used both as feature extractors for the classification task and to discover patterns of visual co-occurrence. Using several data sets, we validate our approach, presenting and discussing experiments on each of these issues. We first show, with extensive experiments on binary and multiclass scene classification tasks using a 9,500-image data set, that the BOV representation consistently outperforms classical scene classification approaches. In other data sets, we show that our approach competes with or outperforms other recent more complex methods. We also show that probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, is discriminative for accurate classification, and is more robust than the BOV representation when less labeled training data is available. Finally, through aspect-based image ranking experiments, we show the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful scene patterns, making such representation useful for browsing image collections.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4288150/04288159.pdf","startPage":"1575","endPage":"1589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Thousand Words in a Scene","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288159/","displayDocTitle":"A Thousand Words in a Scene","volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9692361","pubMedId":"17627045","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288159/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Thousand Words in a Scene","sourcePdf":"i1575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100866S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4288150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4288150","articleId":"4288159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288163,"authors":[{"name":"Alice J.

Although algorithms have been tested and compared extensively with each other, there has been remarkably little work comparing the accuracy of computer-based face recognition systems with humans. We compared seven state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms with humans on a face-matching task. Humans and algorithms determined whether pairs of face images, taken under different illumination conditions, were pictures of the same person or of different people. Three algorithms surpassed human performance matching face pairs prescreened to be \"difficult\" and six algorithms surpassed humans on \"easy\" face pairs. Although illumination variation continues to challenge face recognition algorithms, current algorithms compete favorably with humans. The superior performance of the best algorithms over humans, in light of the absolute performance levels of the algorithms, underscores the need to compare algorithms with the best current control-humans.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4288150/04288163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288150","startPage":"1642","endPage":"1646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Algorithms Surpass Humans Matching Faces Over Changes in Illumination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Algorithms Surpass Humans Matching Faces Over Changes in Illumination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9618881","pubMedId":"17627050","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288163/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Algorithms Surpass Humans Matching Faces Over Changes in Illumination","sourcePdf":"i1642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078949S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4288150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4288150","articleId":"4288163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288165,"authors":[{"name":"Anat Levin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Anat","lastName":"Levin","id":"37282624200"},{"name":"Yair Weiss","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37282991700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"4288165","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":197,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2085},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflection","Glass","Statistics","Painting","Polarization","Lenses","Layout","Reflectivity","Protection","Stereo vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","image processing","interactive systems","least squares approximations","reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user assisted separation","reflections","sparsity prior","linear superposition","natural image statistics","iterative reweighted least squares approach","Gaussian prior"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Refractometry","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"When we take a picture through transparent glass, the image we obtain is often a linear superposition of two images: The image of the scene beyond the glass plus the image of the scene reflected by the glass. Decomposing the single input image into two images is a massively ill-posed problem: In the absence of additional knowledge about the scene being viewed, there are an infinite number of valid decompositions. In this paper, we focus on an easier problem: user assisted separation in which the user interactively labels a small number of gradients as belonging to one of the layers. Even given labels on part of the gradients, the problem is still ill-posed and additional prior knowledge is needed. Following recent results on the statistics of natural images, we use a sparsity prior over derivative filters. This sparsity prior is optimized using the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. Our results show that using a prior derived from the statistics of natural images gives a far superior performance compared to a Gaussian prior and it enables good separations from a modest number of labeled gradients.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4288150/04288165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288150","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Assisted Separation of Reflections from a Single Image Using a Sparsity Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"User Assisted Separation of Reflections from a Single Image Using a Sparsity Prior","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9628139","pubMedId":"17627051","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288165/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Assisted Separation of Reflections from a Single Image Using a Sparsity Prior","sourcePdf":"i1647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070056S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4288150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"4288150","articleId":"4288165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288166,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav Y.

Visibility can be significantly restored by computer vision methods that account for physical processes occurring during image formation. Nevertheless, such recovery is prone to noise amplification in pixels corresponding to distant objects, where the medium transmittance is low. We present an adaptive filtering approach that counters the above problems: While significantly improving visibility relative to raw images, it inhibits noise amplification. Essentially, the recovery formulation is regularized, where the regularization adapts to the spatially varying medium transmittance. Thus, this regularization does not blur close objects. We demonstrate the approach in atmospheric and underwater experiments, based on an automatic method for determining the medium transmittance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4288150/04288166.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Image Recovery in Scattering Media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light scattering","Layout","Image restoration","Degradation","Lighting","Colored noise","Adaptive filters","Machine vision","Polarization","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computer vision","image colour analysis","image restoration","noise","optical images","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized image recovery","scattering media","computer vision methods","visibility restoration","image formation","adaptive filtering approach","noise amplification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color","Polarization","Vision in bad weather","Inverse problems","Dehazing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Light","Nephelometry and Turbidimetry","Reproducibility of Results","Scattering, Radiation","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Image Recovery in Scattering Media","volume":"29","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4288166/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9628140","pubMedId":"17627052","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Image Recovery in Scattering Media","sourcePdf":"i1655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066719S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4288150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4288150","articleId":"4288166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4288214,"authors":[{"name":"Melike Erol","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Melike","lastName":"Erol","id":"37303769200"},{"name":"Luiz Filipe M.

An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aids in localizing the sensor nodes while roaming across the underwater sensor field. The objectives of this paper are to describe how to localize nodes using AUV and to describe the tradeoffs involved, i.e. ratio of localized nodes and localization accuracy. We show that localization success improves as the duration of the AUV localization process increases. In addition, we investigated localization using two methods, bounding-box and triangulation. The former achieves a higher localization ratio but with a higher error. In certain scenarios, we achieved 100% nodes localized with 3% error.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASA.2007.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288201","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288200/4288201/04288214.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AUV-Aided Localization for Underwater Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288214/","displayDocTitle":"AUV-Aided Localization for Underwater Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9869512","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AUV-Aided Localization for Underwater Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"29810044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05619S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288200","isNumber":"4288201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288200","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4288201","articleId":"4288214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4288216,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406928600"},{"name":"Qilian Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qilian","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2981-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2981-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4288216","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Radio transmitters","Costs","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Radio frequency","Error analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","cost reduction","error statistics","fuzzy set theory","MIMO communication","multiplexing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO channel selection","wireless sensor networks","WSN","cost reduction","computational complexity","transmitters","fuzzy c-mean","bit error rate","BER","multiplexing gain","equal transmission power allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present singular-value decomposition- QR with threshold (SVD-QR-T) algorithm to select a subset of channels in virtual MIMO wireless sensor networks (WSN) in order to reduce its complexity and cost. SVD- QR-T selects best subset of transmitters while keeping all receivers active. The threshold is adaptive by means of fuzzy c-mean (FCM). Under the constraint of the same total transmission power, this approach is compared against the case without channel selection in terms of capacity, bit error rate (BER) and multiplexing gain in the presence of water-filling as well without. It is shown that in spite of less multiplexing gain, when water-filling is applied, SVD- QR-T FCM provides lower BER at moderate to high SNR; in case of equal transmission power allocation, SVD-QR-T FCM achieves higher capacity at low SNR and lower BER. In general, it provides satisfying performances compared to the case without channel selection but reduced cost and resource.","doi":"10.1109/WASA.2007.14","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288200/4288201/04288216.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASA.2007.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVD-QR-T FCM Approach for Virtual MIMO Channel Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288216/","displayDocTitle":"SVD-QR-T FCM Approach for Virtual MIMO Channel Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9869514","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288216/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVD-QR-T FCM Approach for Virtual MIMO Channel Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"29810063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078735S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288200","isNumber":"4288201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288200","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288201","articleId":"4288216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288225,"authors":[{"name":"Qingchun Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Qingchun","lastName":"Ren","id":"37265727100"},{"name":"Qilian Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Qilian","lastName":"Liang","id":"37272705100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2981-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2981-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4288225","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288225","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Radio transmitters","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Wireless networks","Analytical models","Upper bound","Signal detection","Electronic mail","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio wireless networks","exposed node problems","energy detection methods","transmitter-independent method","transmitter-receiver-cooperated method","detection probability","system traffic intensity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WASA.2007.17","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288200/4288201/04288225.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASA.2007.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Energy Detection for Cognitive RadioWireless Networks","abstract":"In this paper, considering hidden terminal and exposed node problems, we make a theoretical analysis on the performance of commonly used energy detection methods, such as ideal method, transmitter-independent method and transmitter/receiver-cooperated method, in terms of detection probability.

The long propagation delay and limited bandwidth of acoustic channels make the existing MAC protocols designed for radio networks either unpractical or not energy efficient for underwater sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a reservation-based MAC protocol, called R-MAC. The major design goals of R-MAC are energy efficiency and fairness. R-MAC schedules the transmissions of control packets and data packets to avoid data packet collision completely. The scheduling algorithms not only save energy but also solve the exposed terminal problem inherited in RTS/CTS-based protocols. Furthermore, the scheduling algorithms allow nodes in the network to select their own schedules, thus loosening the synchronization requirement the protocol. Additionally, R-MAC supports fairness. By simulations, we show that R-MAC is an energy efficient and fair MAC solution for underwater sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288230/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9869528","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288230/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"R-MAC: An Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R-MAC: An Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"29810187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05933S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288200","isNumber":"4288201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288200","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4288201","articleId":"4288230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4288236,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Note that the traditional scheduling algorithm making use of the channel status information(CSI) feedback needs broad control channel to transfer the frequent CSI in multipath Rayleigh fast fading channel, which is often impractical or inefficient, we propose a resource allocation algorithm based on tap correlation information(TCOI), which is characterized by channel statistical information. The algorithm is designed to utilize the TCOI to reduce the channel feedback. Because the optimal resolution is high nonlinear, we convert the proposed algorithm into discrete method to achieve lower algorithm complexity. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm has tiny reduction in overall system capacity, but much lower complexity of algorithm and small channel feedback comparing to the traditional scheduling algorithm based on CSI, what's more it outperforms greatly channel independent scheduling basing on pathless in fast Rayleigh fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288200/4288201/04288237.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems and Applications (WASA 2007)","doi":"10.1109/WASA.2007.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASA.2007.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Subcarrier and Power Allocation Algorithm Based on Statistical Information in Multiuser OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Optical feedback","Rayleigh channels","Frequency conversion","Optimization methods","Gallium nitride","Power engineering and energy","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier-power allocation algorithm","statistical information","multiuser OFDM system","multiuser waterfilling theory","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel status information","multipath Rayleigh fast fading channel","tap correlation information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Subcarrier and Power Allocation Algorithm Based on Statistical Information in Multiuser OFDM System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9869535","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Subcarrier and Power Allocation Algorithm Based on Statistical Information in Multiuser OFDM System","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"29810239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043055S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288200","isNumber":"4288201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288200","xplore-issue":"4288201","articleId":"4288237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288263,"authors":[{"name":"Zahi Abuhamdeh","affiliation":["Tran Switch"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4288255/4288263/4288263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zahi Abuhamdeh is director of DFT at TranSwitch in Bedford, Massachusetts.

The lack of predictability is complicating timing closure, physical design, production test, and speed grading of SoCs. This article describes and validates two metrics that quantify the impact of power supply noise. The IC industry is moving quickly to adopt new deep-submicron (DSM) technologies that offer unprecedented integration levels and cost benefits. These advanced technologies pose unexpected challenges to the semiconductor industry. The DSM problems have led the development of SOC design methodologies to deal with the problem of complexity and productivity. To reduce power dissipation, manufacturers have scaled down supply voltage in each successive technology. Designers analyzed power supply noise with static voltage drop (SVD) analysis, which might not reflect the true nature of power supply fluctuations. Dynamic voltage drop (DVD) analysis is emerging as a replacement of SVD analysis for capturing the impact of power supply noise on the timing behavior of logic and memory cells.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Supply Noise in SoCs: Metrics, Management, and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2007.79","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4288255/04288267.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2007.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Supply Noise in SoCs: Metrics, Management, and Measurement","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4288267/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"9621341","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Supply Noise in SoCs: Metrics, Management, and Measurement","sourcePdf":"d3236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048168S","chronDate":"May-June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"4288255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4288255","articleId":"4288267","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288301,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Randel","affiliation":["Corporate Technology, Information and Communications, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Randel","id":"37270938600"},{"name":"Matthias Schuster","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequenztechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Schuster","id":"37318121400"},{"name":"Jeffrey Lee","affiliation":["COBRA Research Institute, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Lee","id":"37934782400"},{"name":"Florian Breyer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Breyer","id":"37318580300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0926-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0927-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1099-4742"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8614"}],"articleNumber":"4288301","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Optical fiber communication","OFDM modulation","Optical signal processing","Optical fiber polarization","Optical filters","Wavelength division multiplexing","Polarization mode dispersion","Optical modulation","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre polarisation","optical links","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","optical communication links","modal dispersion","chromatic dispersion","polarization mode dispersion","wavelength-division multiplexing transmission systems","single-mode fiber"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is currently discussed as an attractive format to overcome physical impairments in spectrally efficient optical communication links such as modal dispersion, chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion.

A variety of methods have been used to compensate chromatic dispersion at 10 Gb/s with subsequent improvements in dispersion tolerance ranging from 800 ps/nm to 80,000 ps/nm, and also a range of circuit costs. At 40 and 100 Gb/s not only is the impact of dispersion more stringent, but the circuit challenges are also severe. In this presentation we will discuss the scaling of electronic dispersion compensation methods to 40 and 100 Gb/s, and show full dispersion compensation in a 40 Gb/s product.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Digest of the IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical Meetings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288288/4288289/04288305.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2007 Digest of the IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical Meetings","doi":"10.1109/LEOSST.2007.4288305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LEOSST.2007.4288305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288289","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Dispersion Compensation Beyond 10 Gb/s","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Optical receivers","Optical signal processing","Nonlinear filters","Optical transmitters","Optical mixing","Signal processing","Finite impulse response filter","Bandwidth","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","BiCMOS integrated circuits","compensation","optical distortion","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical filters","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic dispersion compensation","optical compensation","optical E-Field modulator","BiCMOS","coherent optical receiver","low-power A/D samplers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Dispersion Compensation Beyond 10 Gb/s","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288305/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9792519","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Dispersion Compensation Beyond 10 Gb/s","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"LEOSST-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026315S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288288","isNumber":"4288289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288288","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4288289","articleId":"4288305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288307,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Moreover, with many actual data, there is a lack of reliable knowledge on the sources to be extracted, and the interpretation of the independent components (IC) must be done very carefully, using partial prior information and with interactive discussions with experts.

It has been known that the normalized multichannel frequency domain least-mean-square (NMCFLMS) algorithm misconverges under low signal-to- noise ratio. The coefficients of NMCFLMS converge initially toward the true impulse response after which they then misconverge. The extended NMCFLMS (ext-NMCFLMS) algorithm which has been proposed to mitigate this misconvergence problem assumes the knowledge of magnitude and time-differences-of-arrival (TDOA) of the direct paths for the acoustic impulse responses. In this work, we show how the TDOA can be obtained. More importantly, we present a novel approach to estimate the magnitude of the direct path component under practical conditions. We then show how these estimates can be incorporated to the proposed ext-NMCFLMS with direct path estimation algorithm. We analyze how errors in these estimates affect the performance of the proposed algorithm.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288511.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288511","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288511","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288511","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic applications","Signal processing algorithms","Acoustic noise","Noise robustness","Frequency domain analysis","Adaptive signal processing","Iterative algorithms","Microphone arrays","Filters","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive signal processing","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation algorithm","blind multichannel estimation algorithm","acoustic impulse responses","multichannel identification algorithm","normalized multichannel frequency domain least-mean-square algorithm","signal-to-noise ratio","time-differences-of-arrival","direct path estimation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind channel identification","adaptive signal processing","time-delay estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288511/","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Adaptive Blind Multichannel Estimation Algorithm with Application to Acoustic Impulse Responses","accessionNumber":"9855563","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288511/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Adaptive Blind Multichannel Estimation Algorithm with Application to Acoustic Impulse Responses","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072677S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288514,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"},{"name":"Raimundo Sampaio-Neto","affiliation":["CETUC, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Raimundo","lastName":"Sampaio-Neto","id":"38272134100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288514","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Filtering","Multiaccess communication","Interference suppression","Filter bank","Algorithm design and analysis","Least squares approximation","Adaptive algorithm","Computational modeling","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","code division multiple access","interference suppression","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-rank filtering","projection operator","joint iterative optimization","CDMA","adaptive filters","projection matrix","minimum mean-squared error","least-mean squares algorithms","computational complexity","interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filters","iterative methods"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel adaptive reduced-rank filtering scheme based on the joint iterative optimization of adaptive filters.

Firstly, we find the specific points using Angle comparison Trace. Secondly, from this triangle we calculate weight point of triangle which is used for translation and compensate the rotation of 3D test facial image. Finally, Depth PCA is employed for 3D face recognition where it performs PCA on a 2D x-y axis and takes into account the depth information from 3D Vertices and Face entries. 2D texture information is mapped corresponding to each point at centre of vertices and segment 2-by-2 around this point. The proposed algorithm allows the use of fast iterative algorithm to compute the 3-D facial pose and 3D face recognition that best fits the data. The algorithm has been tested with 3D database and obtained results provide a high level of robustness and accurate recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288562","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288562.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel FNP-Pose Estimation for Three-Dimensional Face Recognition using DPCA Under Facial Expression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288562/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel FNP-Pose Estimation for Three-Dimensional Face Recognition using DPCA Under Facial Expression","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855612","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288562/","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel FNP-Pose Estimation for Three-Dimensional Face Recognition using DPCA Under Facial Expression","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064706S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288563,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Moayedi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Moayedi","id":"37706042100"},{"name":"Reza Boostani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Boostani","id":"37540714400"},{"name":"Zohreh Azimifar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Azimifar","id":"37325226400"},{"name":"Serajedin Katebi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Serajedin","lastName":"Katebi","id":"37696296600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288563","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Mammography","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Fuzzy reasoning","Uncertainty","Machine learning","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","feature extraction","fuzzy neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","image texture","mammography","medical image processing","support vector machines","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machine","fuzzy neural network","mass classification","mammography","digital mammograms","contourlet texture features","image segmentation","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mammography","Mass","Support Vector Based Fuzzy Neural Network (SVFNN)","contourlet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288563","abstract":"In this paper, a new approach for mass classification in digital mammograms based on contourlet texture features and support-vector-based fuzzy neural network (SVFNN) classifier is presented.

A FIR filter that extracts this signal has many taps due to the large ratio of sample rate to the filter's transition bandwidth. We significantly reduce the workload required to accomplish the filtering by operating the filter at a reduced sample rate. We use a polyphase filter as a preprocessor to reduce the sample rate and then as a post processor to return the sample rate to its original value. This method proves to require considerably less resources than the alternate scheme using an iterated FIR filter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288582","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288582.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"318","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forming Narrowband Filters at a Fixed Sample Rate with Polyphase Down and Up Sampling Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Forming Narrowband Filters at a Fixed Sample Rate with Polyphase Down and Up Sampling Filters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288582/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855633","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288582/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forming Narrowband Filters at a Fixed Sample Rate with Polyphase Down and Up Sampling Filters","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03622S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4288583,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Quan","id":"37401122300"},{"name":"Jie Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598336200"},{"name":"Yuriy Zakharov","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Zakharov","id":"37271562300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288583","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Maximum likelihood detection","Bit error rate","Covariance matrix","Sensor arrays","Equations","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA multiuser detector","FPGA","DCD","field-programmable gate array","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","CDMA","multiuser detection","DCD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288583","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288583.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of DCD Based CDMA Multiuser Detector","abstract":"A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a new algorithm for multiuser detection (MUD) is presented in this paper.

The DCD algorithm allows multiplication-free solution of the normal equations. The computational load of the algorithm is mainly due to \"successful\" iterations, when an iV-length auxiliary vector is updated, N being the problem size. The parallel design exploits the fact that elements of the auxiliary vector can be updated simultaneously. As such an update involves additions and bit-shifts only, the increase in complexity compared with the serial implementation is not significant, while the throughput can be enhanced. Two parallel designs are proposed; the first uses registers for the system matrix, while the second uses random access memory (RAM). The use of RAM significantly reduces the chip area (number of FPGA slices) without decreasing the throughput. The RAM design exploits the fact that, for the update of the auxiliary vector, only one row of the system matrix is used. The proposed parallel design is verified by applying to an MVDR antenna array beamformer. It is also compared with a QRD-based MVDR beamformer exploiting CORDIC processors. Antenna beampattern obtained from weights calculated in the fixed-point FPGA implementation is compared with a floating-point simulation. The comparison shows good match for a 9-element linear array. The proposed design can provide weight update rate as high as 27 kHz for a 9-element MVDR beamformer.","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288586.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel FPGA Implementation of DCD Algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Parallel FPGA Implementation of DCD Algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855638","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288586/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel FPGA Implementation of DCD Algorithm","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051074S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288588,"authors":[{"name":"Fotios Talantzis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Fotios","lastName":"Talantzis","id":"37063322000"},{"name":"Anthony G.

We first utilize a recently proposed type of full code rate space- time block code, which is quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (QO-STBC) scheme to exploit temporal and spatial diversity within a multiuser environment with k co- channel users. We adopt four transmit antennas for each user and two antennas in the receiver. Our scheme has a combined interference suppression scheme based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and maximum likelihood (ML) detector, followed by an interference cancellation step. The frame error rate (FER) performance for the proposed algorithm is compared with orthogonal space-time block codes (O-STBC) for two transmitter antennas and extended orthogonal space-time block codes (EO-STBC) in quasi-static and slow fading frequency selective channels. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields a significant improvement in FER performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288591.pdf","startPage":"351","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Step Interference Cancellation Technique for a MIMO-OFDM System with Four Transmit Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Block codes","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Frequency","Maximum likelihood detection","OFDM","Interference suppression","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-step interference cancellation technique","MIMO-OFDM system","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","frequency selective channel","quasiorthogonal space-time block code","k co-channel","minimum mean-square error method","maximum likelihood detector","frame error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","QO-STBC","full-rate","interference cancellation","two-step"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Step Interference Cancellation Technique for a MIMO-OFDM System with Four Transmit Antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855643","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Step Interference Cancellation Technique for a MIMO-OFDM System with Four Transmit Antennas","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047329S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288593,"authors":[{"name":"Michael McGuire","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"McGuire","id":"37433706100"},{"name":"Mihai Sima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Sima","id":"37294937000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288593","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Delay","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Degradation","Signal processing","Computational efficiency","Interference","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","embedded systems","fading channels","fixed point arithmetic","iterative decoding","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","parallel algorithms","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-wise parallel detection","fast fading","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM signal decoding","parallel algorithm","iterative decoding algorithm","fixed-point arithmetic","fixed-point parallel embedded processors","multipath propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","fast fading","parallel computation"]}],"abstract":"The bit-error rate of the standard decoding algorithms for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) degrades when the channel is not stationary. Existing algorithms that decode OFDM signals in fast fading have significant computational cost and are inherently sequential which creates a large decoding latency even on systems with large processing capabilities. To reduce the decoding latency, and maintain high data rates, we introduce a new algorithm where blocks of the received OFDM symbol are detected in parallel. A number of iterations are performed to estimate and remove the interference between the blocks of the OFDM symbol. This algorithm gives error performance nearly as good as the best detection algorithms under fast fading, but it is also parallel in nature. We also show that the algorithm can be implemented in fixed-point arithmetic. This means that the algorithm we propose can be implemented on fixed-point parallel embedded processors, and thus a significant reduction of the decoding latency is indeed possible at a low implementation cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288593","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288593.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Wise Parallel Detection for OFDM with Fast Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288593/","displayDocTitle":"Block-Wise Parallel Detection for OFDM with Fast Fading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855645","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288593/","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Wise Parallel Detection for OFDM with Fast Fading","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042748S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288599,"authors":[{"name":"Shahin Gheitanchi","firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Gheitanchi","id":"37540915200"},{"name":"Falah Ali","firstName":"Falah","lastName":"Ali","id":"37277226200"},{"name":"Elias Stipidis","firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Stipidis","id":"37277219300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288599","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Resource management","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","resource allocation","OFDMA","artificial intelligence","centralized iterative optimization techniques","sub-carrier allocation","computation complexity","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Swarm Intelligence","OFDMA","Subcarrier Allocation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288599","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288599.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Resource Allocation in OFDMA","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well- known technique in artificial intelligence (AI) for n- dimensional optimization problems.

Several numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed block CS compares favorably with existing schemes at a much lower implementation cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Compressed Sensing of Natural Images","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288604","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288604.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Block Compressed Sensing of Natural Images","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288604/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855656","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Compressed Sensing of Natural Images","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0602S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4288609,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cafer Gurbuz","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali Cafer","lastName":"Gurbuz","id":"37266698900"},{"name":"James H.

The values of the derivative function are shown to correspond to a set of inner product calculations, giving rise to a minimax solution for an h approximation problem.

The mixed signals are characterized by a nonlinear state space model which models both the statistical properties of the source signals and the overall nonlinear mixing process. A novel algorithm based on maximum likelihood framework has been rigorously developed for estimating the parameters in the model as well as inferring the source signals. In the proposed model, the nonlinear distortion function is modeled by using high order polynomials which enable the model to be formulated and optimized in a tractable manner. The strength of the proposed approach lies in the closed estimation of the source signals and the adaptive optimization procedure of the model parameters. This has resulted in high performance accuracy, fast convergence and efficient implementation of the estimation algorithm. Simulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the obtained results have shown 50% better accuracy than conventional nonlinear algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288640","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","startPage":"547","endPage":"550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonlinear State Space Approach to Nonlinear Blind Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear State Space Approach to Nonlinear Blind Source Separation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288640/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855692","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288640/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear State Space Approach to Nonlinear Blind Source Separation","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048635S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4288641,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Among the different options for the efficient use of the available UWB spectrum, the Multi band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) approach has received strong support from several industrial organizations. However, the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) limits its capacity due to distortion caused by nonlinear component such as high power amplifier. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the PAPR of MB-OFDM UWB signals. In this paper, the effects of clipping for PAPR reduction and filtering to suppress out of band clipping noise on the performance of MB-OFDM UWB signals are analyzed through computer simulations. In the analysis, power spectral density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) are used as performance measures. Our results demonstrated that clipping and filtering after clipping is a promising technique for the transmission of MB-OFDM UWB signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288643.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"562","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Effects of Clipping and Filtering on the Performance of MB-OFDM UWB Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Filtering","Peak to average power ratio","Bit error rate","Channel capacity","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication","OFDM","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clipping effects analysis","filtering effects analysis","MB-OFDM UWB signals","ultrawideband system","short-range wireless communication","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high power amplifier","power spectral density","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB-OFDM UWB","clipping","filtering","peak-to-average power ratio(PAPR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Effects of Clipping and Filtering on the Performance of MB-OFDM UWB Signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288643/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855695","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Effects of Clipping and Filtering on the Performance of MB-OFDM UWB Signals","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049446S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288647,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288647","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288647","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Delay","Circuits","Signal processing","Sensor systems","Bandwidth","Statistics","Adaptive arrays","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","array signal processing","delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive broadband beamforming","analogue tapped delay-lines","digital sampling circuit","analogue circuit","received sensor signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive broadband beamforming","sensor delay-lines","tapped delay-lines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288647","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288647.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Broadband Beamforming with Spatial-Only Information","abstract":"A novel adaptive broadband beamforming structure is proposed, where the tapped delay-lines in the traditional broadband beamforming structure are replaced by sensor delay-lines and only one coefficient is required for each of the received sensor signals.

This work is then extended to a broadband MIMO scenario where SBR2, a novel algorithm for calculating the EVD of a polynomial matrix is applied. The algorithm's operation, based on Jacobi rotations is discussed and a multi-channel beamformer is designed. This is evaluated against a transmitter antenna selection (TAS) and a transmitter-receiver antenna selection scheme (TRAS) in terms of channel gain. By using the dominant SBR2 mode for transmission and a matched filter to coherently combine the received the signals, a single very high gain wireless channel can be designed. Alternatively SBR2 may be applied at both the transmitter and receiver to design multiple orthogonal high gain wireless channels. The proposed SBR2 technique therefore has the potential to enhance spectral efficiency by exploiting spatial and temporal diversity in a wireless system.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288648","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288648.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband MIMO Beamforming using Spatial-Temporal Filters and Polynomial Matrix Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288648/","displayDocTitle":"Broadband MIMO Beamforming using Spatial-Temporal Filters and Polynomial Matrix Decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855700","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288648/","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband MIMO Beamforming using Spatial-Temporal Filters and Polynomial Matrix Decomposition","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052158S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288649,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Lin","affiliation":["Communications Research Group Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37702119400"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Richard Langley","affiliation":["Communications Research Group Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Langley","id":"37266755400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0882-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1546-1874"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-3577"}],"articleNumber":"4288649","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Delay lines","Bandwidth","Adaptive arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Propagation delay","Finite impulse response filter","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","bandwidth allocation","correlation methods","delays","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband beamforming structure","tapped delay-lines","bandwidth performance","adaptive two-element array","sensor delay lines","SDL structure","correlation matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broadband beamforming","sensor delay-lines","tapped delay-lines","bandwidth performance"]}],"abstract":"The bandwidth performance of an adaptive two- element array with sensor delay lines (SDLs) attached is studied in terms of the inter-spacing between delay line sensors and the number of delay line sensors added.

It stems from the use of the matrix-based multifilters and the extra pre and postfiltering stages, which are popularly adopted for initializing the input data. Recently, we proposed a generalized structure for the discrete multiwavelet transform (GDMWT). The new structure allows the prefilters to embed into the transform such mat the related complexity of implementing the prefilters can be reduced. In this paper, we further consider the efficient realization method of GDMWT. We show that the matrix-based multifilters can be simplified by applying different Givens rotations to the factorized matrices. A new lattice structure is then proposed for their efficient realizations. As compared with the scalar wavelet transform for example using biorthogonal 9/7 wavelet, the proposed approach has a similar complexity while enjoying a better energy compaction performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288490/4288491/04288662.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"638","publicationTitle":"2007 15th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.2007.4288662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Realization of Generalized Discrete Multiwavelet Transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","filtering theory","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized discrete multiwavelet transforms","computational complexity","matrix-based multifilters","factorized matrices","lattice structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiwavelets","orthogonality","prefilter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Realization of Generalized Discrete Multiwavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9855712","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Realization of Generalized Discrete Multiwavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"ICDSP-00-171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068061S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288490","isNumber":"4288491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288490","xplore-issue":"4288491","articleId":"4288662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288688,"authors":[{"name":"T. de Cola","affiliation":["CNIT-Italian National Consortium for Telecommunications, University of Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"T.","lastName":"de Cola","id":"37296678900"},{"name":"H.

Since the overall QoS of a single flow is determined by the minimum received QoS among all of its subflows, the global network utility is defined only based on these bottleneck QoS's for each user.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.25","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"96","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power Control in Multihop Ad Hoc CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power Control in Multihop Ad Hoc CDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288696/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874719","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288696/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Power Control in Multihop Ad Hoc CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S03P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099071S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4288710,"authors":[{"name":"H.

LCMV beamforming is able to perfectly cancel a number of dominant interferers while other interferers remain. A simplified beamforming model is used to derive closed-form outage probability expressions considering the impact of LCMV beam patterns on various interferers. Fading statistics of Rayleigh, and Nakagami are used to characterize the desired signal, whereas interferers are assumed to be subject to Rayleigh fading. One important aspect of this paper is the consideration of the directions of arrivals (DOA) of the dominant interferers and the exact beam patterns in the outage performance evaluations of LCMV beamforming systems. Numerical results of the outage probability are presented to illustrate the impact of DOA's of the dominant interferers and the impact of different fading scenarios. The paper also presents performance comparison between LCMV beamforming and conventional beamforming considering different interference scenarios (DOA's of dominant interferers).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288710/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9874733","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288710/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Outage Performance of Wireless Systems with LCMV Beamforming for Dominant Interferers Cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Performance of Wireless Systems with LCMV Beamforming for Dominant Interferers Cancellation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S05P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058542S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288718,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We present a general analytical procedure, and derive the achievable delay-bound violation probability, the packet loss rate, and the average throughput of AM in MIMO wireless links employing orthogonal space time block coding (STBC) over Nakagami fading channels. In the proposed analytical procedure, we use statistical delay-bound for deadline constrained traffic based on the effective bandwidth theory. Based on our performance analysis, we propose a cross-layer design, which selects the optimal target packet error rate of AM at the physical layer, to minimize the packet loss rate and maximize the average throughput, when combined with packet queuing at the data link layer. Numerical results demonstrate that the system performance depends on various parameters, and show the performance gain due to cross-layer design. We also discuss briefly possible applications of our proposed modeling to quality of service guarantee in multiuser scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288718.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queuing with Adaptive Modulation over MIMO Wireless Links for Deadline Constrained Traffic: Cross-Layer Analysis and Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Queueing analysis","MIMO","Traffic control","Delay effects","Throughput","Cross layer design","Probability","Block codes","Fading","Constraint theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","block codes","MIMO communication","queueing theory","space-time codes","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","MIMO wireless links","deadline constrained traffic","cross-layer analysis","packet transmission","delay-bound violation probability","orthogonal space time block coding","Nakagami fading channels","packet queuing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Queuing with Adaptive Modulation over MIMO Wireless Links for Deadline Constrained Traffic: Cross-Layer Analysis and Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874740","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queuing with Adaptive Modulation over MIMO Wireless Links for Deadline Constrained Traffic: Cross-Layer Analysis and Design","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S05P14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0509S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288725,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As an application of the fixed-period sampling, we also focus on the flow-rate estimation from fixed-period sampled packet streams. In particular, we propose a simple estimator based solely on the sampling frequency overestimates flow rates of detected flows.

A core node, the packet control function (PCF) is processing power limited. Whereas a feeding node, the packet data serving node (PDSN), has superior processing metrics. A close-loop backpressure solution was proposed at the literature to efficiently control the PCF queue by utilizing PDSN free buffer space during PCF congestion events. Differentiated services (DiffServ) have been designed for Internet to provide multiple levels of network services. We propose a model for providing service differentiation at the CDMA2000 data networks. The model aims to provide service differentiations comparable to the traditional DiffServ model. The proposed improvement is in providing those services under the CDMA2000 structure of tandem nodes with large rate mismatch and a constraint of maintaining the complexity level of the processing limited core node (the PCF). The model uses a combination of backpressure and DiffServ techniques. The backpressure mechanism is used to push congestion from the PCF to the PDSN edge node where superior treatment of differentiated services can be provided to the traffic. The model differentiates services in terms of the relative access to the output link bandwidth and provides distinct handling to traffic at the multiple RED physical queues. It enables differentiation in terms of the achieved relative throughput, packet loss rate, delay, and jitter. We demonstrate the solution's robustness with various traffic scenarios and system topologies. We show that our architecture is effective in providing bandwidth differentiation, as well as throughput, packet drop rate, and average delay preferences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DiffServ Model with Backpressure for CDMA2000","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.58","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288729.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"DiffServ Model with Backpressure for CDMA2000","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288729/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874751","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DiffServ Model with Backpressure for CDMA2000","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045472S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288730,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This optimization problem is solved subject to a set of constraints. Previous research has suggested a minimum guaranteed quality of service plus bounds on individual transmission powers and the aggregate transmitted power as the constraints. Solving this problem, it is found out that the solution is very prone to including one station which transmits at a rate a hundred times as much as the others. Thus, it is concluded that the above constraints are not enough to produce a solution which can be realized in an actual system. It is suggested that lack of any constraint which explicitly controls either the maximum capacity of each station or the unfairness of the whole system is responsible for this shortcoming. In this paper, we include a maximum capacity constraint into the formulation and propose an algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem. Then, empirical evidence are analyzed to show that the system actually becomes more balanced and practical after the new constraint is added to it.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.59","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288730.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A More Realistic Approach to Information-Theoretic Sum Capacity of Reverse Link CDMA Systems in a Single Cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A More Realistic Approach to Information-Theoretic Sum Capacity of Reverse Link CDMA Systems in a Single Cell","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288730/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874752","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288730/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A More Realistic Approach to Information-Theoretic Sum Capacity of Reverse Link CDMA Systems in a Single Cell","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S07P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078699S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288733,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, for traffic engineering of cellular networks, channel occupancy times need to be modeled instead to facilitate analytical modeling or to feed network simulations. In this paper, we classify channel occupancy times and present an empirical study based on data obtained from a real cellular network to determine which probability distribution functions can approximate them better. The results are environment dependent, but no assumptions that can be influential are made, as opposed to previous analytical and simulation studies which results are highly dependent on the assumptions made by the authors. We show that all types of channel occupancy times can be approximated by lognormal distribution. For stationary users, channel occupancy times are commonly approximated by exponential distribution due to its tractability, assuming that cell residence times are also exponentially distributed. However, we show that lognormal distribution fits much better to both channel occupancy and call holding times regardless of whether users are stationary or mobile.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.62","startPage":"332","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288733.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Channel Occupancy Times for Voice Traffic in Cellular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Exponential distribution","Statistical distributions","Analytical models","Circuits","Telephony","Probability distribution","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","exponential distribution","log normal distribution","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel occupancy times","voice traffic","cellular networks","telephony networks","probability distribution functions","lognormal distribution","exponential distribution","cell residence times","call holding times"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Channel Occupancy Times for Voice Traffic in Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874755","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Channel Occupancy Times for Voice Traffic in Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S07P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042308S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4288738,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The anomaly can be observable, at some scale, in different ways: an increase in the number of packets, an increase in the number of bytes, a concentration of packets around a port number, etc. In this paper we propose an anomaly independent methodology for detecting such traffic anomalies and to classify them. To accomplish that, we integrate previous work in a multi-criteria tomographic analysis process, criteria being bytes, packets or flow rate, port number or address distribution, etc. As a demarcation from this inspiring work, this new methodology is based on a multi-scale analysis, which always permits the exhibition of anomalies on at least one parameter at one time scale. The motivation for using simple parameters deals with making the interpretation of anomalies simpler, and mitigation mechanisms obvious. In addition, this methodology associates to each anomaly a set of parameters that is able to characterize the anomaly and will serve as a signature for it. This paper presents this methodology, the related algorithm for anomaly detection, and its application on several real traffic traces captured on several networks: Auckland university, GEANT and Renater.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288738.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Scale Tomographic Algorithm for Detecting and Classifying Traffic Anomalies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Telecommunication traffic","Computer science","Computer crime","Communications Society","Degradation","Change detection algorithms","IP networks","Statistics","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication computing","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale tomographic algorithm","traffic anomaly detection","traffic anomaly classification","anomaly independent methodology","traffic anomalies","multicriteria tomographic analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Scale Tomographic Algorithm for Detecting and Classifying Traffic Anomalies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874760","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Scale Tomographic Algorithm for Detecting and Classifying Traffic Anomalies","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042713S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288744,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This standard provides quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in the medium access control (MAC) layer of 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). In other words, the 802.11e standard updates the MAC layer of the former 802.11 standard for QoS. In particular, the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) function of 802.11e is an enhancement of the distributed coordination function (DCF) of 802.11. In this paper, we present an analytical model for EDCA in saturation mode. Our model incorporates an accurate contention window (CW) and arbitration interframe space (AIFS) differentiation. In addition, it provides virtual collision treatment for an access category (AC). Validating the theoretical results via simulations, we show that i) the proposed model accurately captures EDCA saturation throughput, and ii) this model is substantially more accurate than the models previously proposed in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation Throughput Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.74","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288745.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Saturation Throughput Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288745/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874767","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation Throughput Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S09P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082192S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288754,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We evaluate and compare live HSDPA operational network performance from the end-user perspective, especially related to voice over IP and Web browsing applications. We compare goodput performance with user datagram protocol (UDP) and transmission control protocol (TCP) in both wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) and HSDPA. We also address one-way delay measurements to show how up- and downlink asymmetry affects delay and jitter. We found that HSDPA and WCDMA goodput correlate well with the advertised maximum performance values. However, with small payload sizes HSDPA does not bring a substantial improvement over TCP. With UDP the situation is clearly better except with payload sizes commonly used by VoIP. We verify that HSDPA delay is substantially smaller than with WCDMA, as well as the occurrence of delay spikes caused by link level retransmissions. We found that despite 2 ms time division in HSDPA, the main jitter level is at 10 ms. The results can be exploited by operators and equipment manufacturers for service optimisation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HSDPA Performance in Live Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.83","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288754.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"HSDPA Performance in Live Networks","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288754/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HSDPA Performance in Live Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S11P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051759S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4288757,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper proposes the use of the EVT (extreme value theory) for the analysis of wireless network traffic. The role of EVT is to allow the development of procedures that are scientifically and statistically rational to estimate the extreme behavior of random processes. We have performed extensive simulation experiments by taking traffic data that is greater than a given threshold value. The results of our experiments and analysis show the wireless network traffic model obtained through the EVT fits well with the empirical distribution of traffic. Meanwhile, we can obtain EVT model has the lowest \"average deviation\" compared with other popular distribution model such as exponential, lognormal, gamma, Weibull. Thus illustrates EVT is more suitable than other distributions to model the traffic and it has a good application foreground in the analysis of wireless network traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288757.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"491","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Extreme Value Theory to the Analysis of Wireless Network Traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Quality of service","Data analysis","Probability distribution","Communications Society","Application software","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","radio networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extreme value theory","wireless network traffic","threshold value"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of Extreme Value Theory to the Analysis of Wireless Network Traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874779","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Extreme Value Theory to the Analysis of Wireless Network Traffic","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S11P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063793S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4288758,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These applications demand real-time service, while the networks should still be able to transfer also other traffic reliably (e.g., data, e- mail, WWW). We have developed a measurement tool, which is able to measure one-way QoS performance statistics. The tool enables passive monitoring of the desired application(s) and gives information about the QoS provided by the network. The tool can be used practically over any kind of network structure as long as IP is supported. In this paper, we focus on detailed end-to-end delay characteristics measured in live HSDPA (high speed downlink packet access) enabled 3G network. HSDPA provides clearly better delay performance than the basic WCDMA (wideband code division multiple access). Interestingly, deterministic long time behavior in delay was observed, and also, discrete jitter levels were found. With argumentation, and finally with a trial, we proved that these phenomena originate from the CBR-type (constant bit rate) VoIP source traffic affecting with 3G network timing mechanisms and mutual clock drifts. As a side product, the study also showed that it is advisable to verify the operation of traffic generation tools before using them.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Delay","Quality of service","Telecommunication traffic","IPTV","Internet telephony","Videoconference","Postal services","World Wide Web","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","broadband networks","code division multiple access","delays","Internet telephony","multimedia communication","packet radio networks","quality of service","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WCDMA","HSDPA delay characteristics","quality of service","QoS","VoIP","voice over IP","video conferencing","online gaming","Internet protocol television","real-time service","end-to-end delay characteristics","high speed downlink packet access","3G network","wideband code division multiple access","discrete jitter levels","QoSMeT","multimedia applications","IPTV"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288758","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.87","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288758.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.87","startPage":"492","endPage":"498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring WCDMA and HSDPA Delay Characteristics with QoSMeT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measuring WCDMA and HSDPA Delay Characteristics with QoSMeT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288758/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288758/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874780","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring WCDMA and HSDPA Delay Characteristics with QoSMeT","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S01S11P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064448S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288783,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Besides this closed form threshold expression, the p-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, for given code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some cases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best known check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second, the threshold optimization problem within the p-positive class can be solved in some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization tool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The last property is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributions belong to the p-positive family.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Polynomials","Optimization methods","Decoding","Communications Society","Peer to peer computing","Mutual information","Stability","Upper bound","Constraint theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC erasure distributions","closed-form threshold expression","low-density parity-check degree distributions","decoding threshold","binary erasure channel","BEC","check regular distributions","p-positive distribution","threshold optimization problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.113","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288784.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of LDPC Erasure Distributions with Closed-Form Threshold Expression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Class of LDPC Erasure Distributions with Closed-Form Threshold Expression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288784/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288784/","accessionNumber":"9874805","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of LDPC Erasure Distributions with Closed-Form Threshold Expression","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046549S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288785,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Reducing attention to the binary erasure channel (BEC), this problem translates into the problem of finding elements of selected (irregular) LDPC code ensemble with the size of the minimal stopping set being maximized. Faced with the lack of analytical solution to this problem, simple but powerful heuristic design algorithm, an ACE constrained design algorithm, was recently introduced. Building upon the ACE metric associated with every cycle in the code graph, we introduce the ACE spectrum of LDPC code as a useful measure of success in selection of the LDPC code from selected ensemble. Using ACE spectrum, we farther generalize ACE constrained design, making it more flexible and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.114","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288785.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACE Spectrum of LDPC Codes and Generalized ACE Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"ACE Spectrum of LDPC Codes and Generalized ACE Design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288785/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9874806","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACE Spectrum of LDPC Codes and Generalized ACE Design","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S01P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115837S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":4288786,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Voicila","affiliation":["ENSEA/UCP/CNRS UMR-8051, ETIS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Voicila","id":"37078732900"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["ENSEA/UCP/CNRS UMR-8051, ETIS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37269103100"},{"name":"Francois Verdier","affiliation":["ENSEA/UCP/CNRS UMR-8051, ETIS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Verdier","id":"37393902000"},{"name":"Marc Fossorier","affiliation":["Univ.

The key feature of our decoder is to truncate the vector messages of the decoder to a limited number nm of values in order to reduce the memory requirements. Using the truncated messages, we propose an efficient implementation of the EMS decoder which reduces the order of complexity to O(n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n), which starts to be reasonable enough to compete with binary decoders.

A particularly suitable application of the network coding arises for the two-way relay channels, where two nodes communicate with each other assisted by using a third, relay node. Such a scenario enables application of physical network coding, where the network coding is either done (a) jointly with the channel coding or (b) through physical combining of the communication flows over the multiple access channel. In this paper we first group the existing schemes for physical network coding into two generic schemes, termed 3-step and 2-step scheme, respectively. We investigate the conditions for maximization of the two-way rate for each individual scheme: (1) the decode-and-forward (DF) 3-step schemes (2) three different schemes with two steps: amplify-and-forward (AF), JDF and denoise-and-forward (DNF). While the DNF scheme has a potential to offer the best two-way rate, the most interesting result of the paper is that, for some SNR configurations of the source - relay links, JDF yields identical maximal two-way rate as the upper bound on the rate for DNF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288792/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9874813","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288792/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Physical Network Coding in Two-Way Wireless Relay Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Network Coding in Two-Way Wireless Relay Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S02P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062429S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"475","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288796,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Exploiting an equivalence between correlative coding and partial-response signaling, a bit error rate performance measure is employed to assess the performance of OFDM systems using correlative coding. It is shown that although partial-response pulse-shaping or correlative coding can reduce intercarrier interference due to carrier frequency offset, they do not necessarily improve the system bit error rate performance because of the introduction of multilevel signaling with associated reduced receiver decision distance. It is observed that bit error rate performance improvement for symbol-by-symbol detection can be achieved only in some cases of large frequency offset. In the case of smaller, practical, values of frequency offset the bit error rate is increased by correlative coding or partial-response pulse-shaping.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288800.pdf","startPage":"756","endPage":"761","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Correlative Coding for OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Error analysis","Doppler shift","Pulse measurements","Partial response signaling","Transmitters","Data communication","Intersymbol interference","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","correlative coding","partial-response signaling","bit error rate","pulse shaping","intercarrier interference","multilevel signaling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Correlative Coding for OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288800/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874821","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Correlative Coding for OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S04P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047256S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288801,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Moreover, a variant of dSLM which does not require any side information to recover data at the receiver is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.130","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288801.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"762","endPage":"767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in MIMO OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in MIMO OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288801/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874822","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction in MIMO OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S04P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124948S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288803,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Simultaneous transmission (broadcasting) to all mobile stations using the entire available bandwidth is known to yield rates dominating any other channel-sharing technique for Gaussian channels. However, broadcasting is very complicated from an implementation point of view. We analyze and compare different channel-sharing techniques on the basis of the asymptotic minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per MS necessary at the BS to transmit to a certain set of MSs in a single cell at a common data rate. From our results we conclude that suboptimal but practical methods like two- or three-level superposition coding when used in conjunction with frequency division multiplexing perform sufficiently close to the optimum and hence, are good alternatives to the optimal broadcasting scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288806/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874827","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of Optimal and Suboptimal Forward-Link Channel-Sharing Schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of Optimal and Suboptimal Forward-Link Channel-Sharing Schemes","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049445S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4288808,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The interfering signals are assumed to be independent and Rayleigh-faded. It is shown that in a synchronous channel, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of a WMF can not exceed that of the conventional matched filter (CMF) receiver. It is observed that in a synchronous channel, an interference WMF degrades the performance both through decreasing the SINR and introducing intersymbol interference (ISI). In contrast, in an asynchronous channel an optimal WMF can improve the SINR relative to the CMF receiver. It is shown that for a standard raised-cosine pulse the maximum achievable SINR gain over the CMF receiver is 1.76 dB.

The new method has less decoding complexity and is not restricted to low density codes. In multipath reception, the same packet may be received more than once, correctly or incorrectly, packets may be received out of order, or with error. Despite this and despite using no sequence number overhead and very limited error detection overhead, the decoder can decode the packet-based code and re-order the data as long as the errors and deletions do not come within 2 of covering the positions of any code word. If order is preserved, the constraint is not to come within one of covering any code word. Also, it is shown how convolutional codes can further simplify decoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874830","htmlLink":"/document/4288809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Packet-Symbol Decoding for Reliable Multipath Reception with No Sequence Numbers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet-Symbol Decoding for Reliable Multipath Reception with No Sequence Numbers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042402S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288810,"authors":[{"name":"T.-M.

Owing to the fact that the analysis of the natural logarithm of the modified Bessel function is intractable, two ML diversity-combining receivers, that are named as ML-A and ML-B receivers according to the different conditions of the approximation, have been analyzed theoretically based upon a correlated two-path frequency-selective channel model. The performance of these two receivers compared with that of other diversity-combining receivers in terms of the bit error rate(BER) has been scrutinized. Computer simulations confirm that our numerical analyses are valid. Furthermore, the ML-B receiver outperforms other receivers, while the ML-A receiver is only as good as the ML-B counterpart when the signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR) is greater than 24 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.139","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288810.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.139","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"815","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Receivers for FFH/BFSK Systems with Multitone Jamming over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Receivers for FFH/BFSK Systems with Multitone Jamming over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288810/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288810/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874831","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Receivers for FFH/BFSK Systems with Multitone Jamming over Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070973S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4288811,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the following, we present an approach of applying communication theory for biological sequence analysis. We use an analogy to frame synchronization to gain more insights into transcription, the step of copying a gene into messenger RNA (mRNA). In continuous and packet data transmission, successful decoding of a transmitted data stream at the receiver side strongly depends on the choice of the sync word that indicates the beginning of the message and thus needs to be detected reliably. Analogously, biological sync words indicate the beginning of a gene, i.e. they mark the sequence in the DNA that needs to be copied during transcription. These biological sync words are the -35 promoter region and the -10 promoter region named after their approximate position before the gene. In digital data transmission, the sync word is selected from all possible patterns based on its autocorrelation behavior. Therefore, we use an adapted autocorrelation function to investigate the synchronization properties of the promoter regions revealing that the -35 region is an outstanding synchronization pattern. In contrast to that, the -10 region, though more important for transcription initiation, showed to have worse properties. However, when including sequence constraints imposed through the region's importance for transcription, the -10 region showed to be among the best possible sequences, too. These facts imply that during evolution promoter sequences evolved in a way to optimize their synchronization properties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Techniques from Frame Synchronization for Biological Sequence Analysis","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.142","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288813.pdf","startPage":"833","endPage":"838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Applying Techniques from Frame Synchronization for Biological Sequence Analysis","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288813/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874834","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Techniques from Frame Synchronization for Biological Sequence Analysis","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047364S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288814,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An efficient list decoding algorithm for algebraic-geometric (AG) codes and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes has been developed by Guruswami and Sudan, called the Guruswami-Sudan (GS) algorithm. The algorithm includes two steps: Interpolation and Factorisation. To implement interpolation, Koetter proposed an iterative polynomial construction algorithm for RS codes. By redefining a polynomial over algebraic function fields, Koetter's algorithm can also be applied to AG codes. To implement factorisation, Roth and Ruckenstein proposed an efficient algorithm for RS codes and later Wu and Siegel extended it to AG codes. Following on from their previous work, we propose a more general factorisation algorithm which can be applied to both AG and RS codes. This algorithm avoids rational function quotient calculations required by Wu and SiegePs algorithm, making it more efficient to implement. As well as employing this algorithm to list decode AG and RS codes this paper also presents the first simulation results evaluating the list decoding performance comparison between AG and RS codes of a similar code rate defined over the same finite field.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.145","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288816.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Factorisation Algorithm for List Decoding Algebraic-Geometric and Reed-Solomon Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288816/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Factorisation Algorithm for List Decoding Algebraic-Geometric and Reed-Solomon Codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874837","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288816/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Factorisation Algorithm for List Decoding Algebraic-Geometric and Reed-Solomon Codes","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047189S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4288818,"authors":[{"name":"R.-Y.

In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that allows full frequency reuse in every cell and deploys a network-wide linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receiver as the front-end processor to suppress ICI. Assuming equal transmit power for all users, we compare the achievable rate of the LMMSE receiver in the information-theoretic sense against the rates achieved by two different frequency reuse schemes, namely the conventional reuse scheme with single-cell processing and a reuse scheme that allows interference-free processing of signals from adjacent cells. We first compare the performance under a fixed path-gain model and then extend to a random fading model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Strategic planning","Interference","Fading","Frequency division multiaccess","Narrowband","Signal processing","Wideband","Decoding","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","fading","frequency allocation","interference (signal)","least mean squares methods","radio receivers","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular networks","global LMMSE receiver","intercell interference management strategy","frequency reuse","network-wide linear minimum mean square error receiver","random fading model"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.148","startPage":"870","endPage":"876","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288819.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of Cellular Networks with Global LMMSE Receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of Cellular Networks with Global LMMSE Receiver","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9874840","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288819/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of Cellular Networks with Global LMMSE Receiver","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063522S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4288825,"authors":[{"name":"P.

If the channel state is Gaussian distributed, this problem is equivalent to that of transmission of a Gaussian source over a noisy channel. We focus on a model in which the source outputs are statistically independent and the feedback channel is either AWGN or Rayleigh fading. Due to the strict delay constraints, information theoretic results are hardly applicable to the analysis of such a setting. As a consequence, despite its simplicity, little is known about its fundamental performance limits. Here, two different delay limited digital transmission approaches and a linear analog transmission approach are discussed and compared. If D channel uses per source output are allowed, it is shown that for the AWGN feedback channel delay limited digital approaches can achieve a distortion decay of at least D/2 dB per dB of SNR. This decay rate is 1 for the linear analog approach regardless D. For Rayleigh feedback channels the distortion decay rate is shown to be upper bounded by 1 for digital approaches and is asymptotically 1 for the analog approach. This fact and simplicity are good reasons for the use of analog transmission for feedback purposes over fading channels.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288825.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"913","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.154","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.154","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State feedback","Channel state information","AWGN","Delay","Output feedback","Transmitters","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Rayleigh channels","Constraint theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","Gaussian distribution","radio links","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel state information","wireless systems","transmitter","wireless link","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian source","noisy channel","AWGN channel","feedback channel","Rayleigh fading","strict delay constraints","digital transmission","linear analog transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288825/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback of Channel State Information in Wireless Systems","accessionNumber":"9874846","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288825/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback of Channel State Information in Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S05P21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06548S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288827,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

By gradually updating the pseudo-posterior probabilities of all bit nodes, the proposed algorithm minimizes the propagation of erroneous information from trapping sets into the whole graph.

The traditional message-passing schedule consists of updating all the variable nodes in the graph, using the same pre-update information, followed by updating all the check nodes of the graph, again, using the same pre-update information. Recently several studies show that sequential scheduling, in which messages are generated using the latest available information, significantly improves the convergence speed in terms of number of iterations. Sequential scheduling raises the problem of finding the best sequence of message updates. This paper presents practical scheduling strategies that use the value of the messages in the graph to find the next message to be updated. Simulation results show that these informed update sequences require significantly fewer iterations than standard sequential schedules. Furthermore, the paper shows that informed scheduling solves some standard trapping set errors. Therefore, it also outperforms traditional scheduling for a large numbers of iterations. Complexity and implementability issues are also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.158","startPage":"932","endPage":"937","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288829.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288829/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Informed Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9874850","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4288829/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC Codes","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S06P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080208S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4288830,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The problem formulation is such that the output signal-to-noise ratio is maximized under both the aggregate and individual relay power constraints. Our previous results show that these optimization problems can be formulated as quasiconvex optimization problems, and are solved using the bisection method via a sequence of conic feasibility problems.

Such concepts, typically implicitly assuming unlimited information exchange between base stations, can also be used to increase the network fairness. In practical implementations, however, the large amounts of received signals that need to be quantized and transmitted via an additional backhaul between the involved cells to central processing points, will be a non-negligible issue. In this paper, we thus introduce an analytical framework to observe the uplink performance of cellular networks in which joint detection is only applied to a subset of selected users, aiming at achieving best possible capacity and fairness improvements under a strongly constrained backhaul between sites. This reveals a multi-dimensional optimization problem, where we propose a simple, heuristic algorithm that strongly narrows down and serializes the problem while still yielding a significant performance improvement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288836.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"979","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Optimizing the Uplink Performance of Distributed Antenna Systems under a Constrained Backhaul","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Constraint optimization","Transmitting antennas","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Mobile antennas","Interference","Receiving antennas","Gaussian noise","Communications Society","Mobile communication","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mean square error methods","mobile antennas","optimisation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink performance","distributed antenna systems","constrained backhaul","multicell cooperations","cellular networks","joint transmission","joint detection","multidimensional optimization problem","heuristic algorithm","MMSE detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Optimizing the Uplink Performance of Distributed Antenna Systems under a Constrained Backhaul","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874857","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Optimizing the Uplink Performance of Distributed Antenna Systems under a Constrained Backhaul","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S07P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032904S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4288839,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Even if the channel gain is perfectly known to the receiver, inaccurate estimation of the additive noise power, results in incorrect log-likelihood computation at the receiver and hence significant performance degradation in the decoder. Through a detailed study of the effects of channel estimation errors on the performance of soft-decision iterative decoders in uncorrelated block-fading channels, we propose a solution which does not need a knowledge of the power of the additive noise. We show that this solution performs almost identical to the case for which a perfect knowledge of the power of the additive noise exists at the receiver. The choice of the block-fading channel reflects a situation where the equivalent variance of the additive Gaussian noise can change in a wide range and thus the decoder performance seriously relies on the knowledge of the noise power at the receiver.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288842","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Iterative decoding","Wireless communication","Gaussian noise","Additive noise","Additive white noise","Fading","AWGN","Parity check codes","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","fading channels","Gaussian noise","iterative decoding","radio networks","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","wireless communications","time-varying channels","wireless channels","soft-decision iterative decoders","additive noise power estimation","log-likelihood computation","uncorrelated block-fading channels","additive Gaussian noise"]}],"publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288842.pdf","startPage":"1006","endPage":"1011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.171","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation Considerations for Iterative Decoding in Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288842/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation Considerations for Iterative Decoding in Wireless Communications","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874863","htmlLink":"/document/4288842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation Considerations for Iterative Decoding in Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S08P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05164S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288843,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, due to the high complexity of DPC and the infeasibility of the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, in this paper we focus on random beamforming with multiple beams (RB- MUX). The main advantages of RB-MUX are multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gain at limited feedback load. In this paper we analytically assess the ergodic sum-rate of RB-MUX scheme with multiple antennas at the receiver by considering three combining techniques: maximum ratio combiner (MRC), optimum combiner (OC) and antenna selection (AS). The analysis relies on the assumption of large average SNR, so that the additive noise can be assumed negligible as compared to the beams mutual interference.

Recently, this issue was considered by Gartner and Bolcskei and from a perspective of increasing system throughput, they proposed a joint code design for a 2-user scenario. In this paper, by applying a signal space diversity technique and a judicious phase rotation to each of a group of uncoordinated users, we propose a systematic design of SF codes for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems over frequency-selective fading channels. We prove that multiuser SF codes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection can achieve the maximum diversity for each user while minimizing the interference introduced from all the other users.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.179","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288850.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Design of Multiuser Space-Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288850/","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Design of Multiuser Space-Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288850/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874870","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Design of Multiuser Space-Frequency Codes for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S10P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04721S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4288851,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The presence of NBI leads to a contaminated Gaussian (CG) noise probability density function (pdf) which induces an outlier effect in the data detection problem. The outlier effect leads to significant degradation in the performance of turbo coded OFDM systems which use Gaussian noise pdf based log likelihood ratios (LLRs), with the degradation increasing as a function of the power of NBI and the number of subcarriers affected by NBI. We propose to use outlier detection theory to detect subcarriers affected by NBI, and then downweigh the corresponding LLRs before passing them to the turbo decoder. Extreme value theory (EVT) is used to define the weight function in this weighted-LLR (W-LLR) method. The method is easy to implement, is of modest computational complexity, and shows a significant improvement in the simulated error rate performance when compared with the simple unweighted turbo decoder in the presence of NBI. Furthermore, frequency selectivity and diversity mapping in OFDM systems such as IEEE 802.16 d/e WMAN standard causes the co-channel interference (CCI) to look like NBI within the FEC block. Therefore, the W-LLR method can also be applied for CCI mitigation in these systems. Since reuse-one cellular systems have a CCI limited performance, the proposed method provides a significant improvement over the normal turbo decoder.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband Interference Mitigation in Turbo-Coded OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.180","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288851.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband Interference Mitigation in Turbo-Coded OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288851/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874871","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband Interference Mitigation in Turbo-Coded OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S02S10P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058886S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4288852,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.234","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288905.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4288905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288905/","displayDocTitle":"The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9874925","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288905/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S03S07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087501S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4288929,"authors":[{"name":"X.

We show how the system is immune to malicious attacks that adjust transmitted signal strengths in attempts to circumvent the intrusion detection algorithms. We compare our results with earlier work that utilized static position information as a means for intrusion detection, showing how verification errors determined via tracking can be an order of magnitude smaller. Contrary to the static case, we also show how position verification via tracking is viable in the case where only one access point is within range of the mobile device.

Roaming in wireless LAN is generally composed of two parts, 1) searching for a new access point and 2) performing authentication at the new access point. To reduce the second part delay, we propose an innovative lightweight authentication scheme called SFRIC (secure fast /foaming using ID-based cryptography). SFRIC employs ID-based cryptography to simplify the authentication process. It performs mutual authentication for the mobile client and AP with a 3-way handshake, then generates a PTK (pairwise transient key) directly without pre-distributing PMK (pairwise master key). It does not require contacting an authentication server or exchanging certificates. SFRIC is composed of two phases. In the first phase (the preparation phase), each mobile client obtains a temporary private key from the PKG (private key generator). In the second phase (the roaming authentication phase), mutual authentication and key distribution are performed. Our preliminary analysis indicates that SFRIC can complete the roaming authentication within a period much less than the critical 20 ms threshold, required for maintaining streaming traffic, when the cryptographic operations are performed in hardware.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288934.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.263","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SFRIC: A Secure Fast Roaming Scheme in Wireless LAN Using ID-Based Cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288934/","displayDocTitle":"SFRIC: A Secure Fast Roaming Scheme in Wireless LAN Using ID-Based Cryptography","htmlLink":"/document/4288934/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9874954","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SFRIC: A Secure Fast Roaming Scheme in Wireless LAN Using ID-Based Cryptography","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S03S11P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090211S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4288964,"authors":[{"name":"W.-H.

Then, our mechanism adjusts the number of each user's received layers dynamically according to its channel condition and the available network bandwidth, so as to maximize total utility. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and show that our scheme is bounded in performance to the optimal solution and can run in polynomial time. The simulation results show that this scheme can allocate resource flexibly according to the utility function of each program, the popularity of each program (i.e., the number of users receiving each program), and the amount of total available resource in the network.

By sophisticatedly interleaving each coded frame, the packet loss is converted into randomly punctured bits in a turbo code. Therefore, error control of channels with both types of distortions is equivalent to dealing with random bit errors only through turbo codes with reduced rates. To optimally allocate the overall transmission rate between the source and channel codes, a genetic algorithm (GA) based method is proposed which not only largely reduces the optimization complexity but also gives results close to the brute force search in tested scenarios. Then, we extend the UEP to a product code scheme by adding Reed-Solomon (RS) code across the frames. An efficient rate allocation method for this product code with the use of interleaving is further presented. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated with extensive simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.298","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1789","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04288969.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Codes Based Image Transmission for Channels with Both Random Errors and Packet Loss","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Codes Based Image Transmission for Channels with Both Random Errors and Packet Loss","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4288969/","accessionNumber":"9874989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4288969/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Codes Based Image Transmission for Channels with Both Random Errors and Packet Loss","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S04S06P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4288969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4289026,"authors":[{"name":"Wing C.

The solution to this problem maximizes the aggregate throughput subject to peak lasers transmission power constraints. The optimization problem is solved in a closed form, and the resource allocation strategy is simple to implement in an optical network.

It has recently been shown that asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) is more efficient in terms of optical power than conventional optical modulation techniques such as pulse position modulation (PPM). When ACO-OFDM is used, the transmitted signal has a clipped Gaussian probability distribution. We calculate the channel capacity for systems using transmitted signals with exponential and clipped Gaussian distributions, and for an ACO-OFDM system. For practical signal to noise ratios, ACO-OFDM has a slightly lower capacity than the other distributions, due to the correlation between samples caused by the ACO-OFDM modulation process. ACO-OFDM has many practical advantages including its tolerance to multipath distortion. This paper shows that it also makes efficient use of the available power and bandwidth.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289029.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.358","startPage":"2128","endPage":"2133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Capacity of IM/DD Optical Communication Systems and of ACO-OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289029/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Capacity of IM/DD Optical Communication Systems and of ACO-OFDM","htmlLink":"/document/4289029/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875043","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Capacity of IM/DD Optical Communication Systems and of ACO-OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S06S01P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058455S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4289077,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Recently, the wireless part of WOBAN has been gaining increasing attention and early versions are being deployed as a municipal access solution to eliminate the wired backhaul to every wireless router. This architecture saves on network deployment costs because fiber (or wiring) does not need to extend to the end user, and it extends the reach of emerging optical access solutions, e.g., passive optical network (PON)-based access solutions. However, a major research opportunity exists in developing an efficient routing algorithm for the wireless front end of WOBAN. We propose and investigate the characteristics of \"delay- aware routing algorithm (DARA)\" that minimizes the average packet delay in the wireless front end of a WOBAN. We model wireless routers as queues and predict wireless link states periodically. Our simulation experiments show that DARA achieves better load balancing and less congestion compared to tradional approaches such as minimum-hop routing algorithm (MHRA) and shortest- path routing algorithm (SPRA). In addition to minimizing the delay, DARA also improves the average hop count compared to the predictive throughput routing algorithm (PTRA), a popular protocol used in several deployments for the wireless front end of a WOBAN.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"2480","endPage":"2484","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289081.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DARA: Delay-Aware Routing Algorithm in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Delay","Optical fiber networks","Passive optical networks","Costs","Wiring","Predictive models","Load management","Throughput","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","multi-access systems","optical fibre subscriber loops","radio links","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid wireless-optical broadband access network","delay-aware routing algorithm","municipal access solution","wireless router","predictive throughput routing algorithm","wireless front end","minimum-hop routing algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"DARA: Delay-Aware Routing Algorithm in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289081/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289081/","accessionNumber":"9875101","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DARA: Delay-Aware Routing Algorithm in a Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN)","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S06S10P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087233S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289082,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, the optical field undergoes fades or outages due to air turbulence. Spatial diversity is an attractive technique to mitigate these fades. The outage probability of a system that uses diversity has been analyzed for diversity incoherent detection. This paper investigates the benefit of coherent detection with spatial diversity for fade mitigation. We also compare the performance improvement of diversity coherent detection over diversity incoherent detection. We find that coherent detection provides power gain of at least a few more dB for typical background noise limited applications (e.g. 2.86 dB at an error probability threshold of 0.1 and average received background noise photons per bit of 1).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289082/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875102","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Coherent Receivers for Optical Communication over the Clear Turbulent Atmosphere","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Coherent Receivers for Optical Communication over the Clear Turbulent Atmosphere","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S06S10P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080277S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289084,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For the power minimization problem, where QoS constraints need to be satisfied, we introduce a successive beamforming filter computation approach aiming at satisfying at least one additional SNR constraint per orthogonal filter update. As long as the number of users K is smaller than the number N of transmit antennas, this procedure delivers excellent results. Our second approach is an iterative update algorithm for the max-min problem subject to a limitation of the transmit power. Given a low-complexity initialization beamformer, we search within the local vicinity of this filter vector for a filter-update preserving the transmit power and achieving a larger minimum SNR. To this end, we improve the weakest user's SNR during each iteration and keep on applying this procedure as long as the updates increase the smallest SNR. Otherwise, we adapt the step-size and continue investigating the local vicinity. It turns out that this novel approach is superior to existing state-of-the-art multicast beamformers for an arbitrary number of users.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.413","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289084.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.413","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"2499","endPage":"2505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Single-Group Multicasting-Beamformers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Single-Group Multicasting-Beamformers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289084/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289084/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875104","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Single-Group Multicasting-Beamformers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112062S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289086,"authors":[{"name":"C.

By separating all the secondary users into a few clusters and selecting the most favorable user in each cluster to report to the common receiver, the proposed method can exploit the user selection diversity so that the sensing performance can be enhanced.

Secondly, we propose a transformation technique to generate the pair wise DoA and DoD components incorporating the correlation properties of the variates around the full azimuth range.

Conventional MIMO precoding methods can approximately minimize BER of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) based detector by using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel matrices. However, they cannot minimize BER of MLD because the orthogonalization does not increase the Euclidean distance between a pair of channel-distorted replicas of transmitted signals. To optimize the Euclidean distance effectively, the proposed method controls its precoding parameters by minimizing the upper bound of BER based on the pairwise error. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed precoding method outperforms the MMSE precoder and the conventional minimum BER (MBER) precoder that assumes the precoding matrix structure similar to the solution of the weighted MMSE precoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289088.pdf","startPage":"2522","endPage":"2527","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoding with Minimum BER Criterion for MIMO-OFDM Systems Employing ML Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Euclidean distance","Maximum likelihood detection","MIMO","Mean square error methods","Detectors","Singular value decomposition","Matrix decomposition","Optimization methods","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","linear codes","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoding","minimum BER criterion","MIMO-OFDM systems","maximum likelihood detection","Euclidean distance","MMSE precoder","precoding matrix structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoding with Minimum BER Criterion for MIMO-OFDM Systems Employing ML Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289088/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875108","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoding with Minimum BER Criterion for MIMO-OFDM Systems Employing ML Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S02P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04555S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289089,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By an appropriate re-modulation on the received signal blocks, we find an effective way to apply the subspace based channel estimation for the cyclic prefix (CP) based MIMO-OFDM system when the number of the receive antennas is no less than the number of transmit antennas. Suitable relationships are built between the proposed algorithm and one existing technique (called ZPSOS in the future) for zero-padding (ZP) based MIMO-OFDM systems, thanks to the re-modulation considered. Consequently, many advantages could be directly inherited from ZPSOS, for example, robustness to channel order over-estimation, guaranteeing the estimation identiflability. By comparing these two algorithms, we found that they could provide similar channel estimation accuracy but the proposed method could beat the other in terms of bit error rate (BER). Moreover, adopting CP-based OFDM is compatible with many existing standards and applications, which shows great potential of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.428","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289099.pdf","startPage":"2586","endPage":"2591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Blind Channel Estimation for CP-Based MIMO OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289099/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Blind Channel Estimation for CP-Based MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875119","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289099/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Blind Channel Estimation for CP-Based MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S04P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065792S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289100,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To date, emulators are extending single input single output (SISO) time based filtering techniques to emulate MIMO channels, which in turn requires quadratic increase in computational resources as the array size increases. In this paper, a new scalable approach for MIMO wireless channel emulation is presented. It is shown that for a 2x2 MIMO system, by performing channel emulation in the frequency domain, a reduction of up to 43 % in computations per output sample can be achieved as compared to traditional techniques. For higher order arrays, further reduction is possible. It is also illustrated that a linear growth in computational resources is attained through this scheme. The architecture is presented and synthesis results using an FPGA platform are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289100.pdf","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2597","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Wireless Channel Emulator for Broadband MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Emulation","Finite impulse response filter","Filtering","Analytical models","Performance analysis","Communications Society","Prototypes","Frequency domain analysis","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","filtering theory","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiinput multioutput wireless channel emulator","broadband MIMO system","single input single output time-based filtering technique","FPGA platform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Wireless Channel Emulator for Broadband MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289100/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875120","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Wireless Channel Emulator for Broadband MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S04P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048365S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289101,"authors":[{"name":"F.

However, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel estimation become more complex for MIMO-OFDM systems. In this paper, we propose a class of efficient shift-orthogonal training sequences to assist joint CFO and channel estimation. We show that with the proposed training sequence, the CFO estimation touches Cramer- Rao bound (CRB) at practical SNR values. Such sequences are efficient as the overhead used for channel estimation can be significantly reduced compared to using conventional training sequence designs. We also derive a tight lower bound on the MSE of the channel estimation in the presence of the residual CFO.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289102.pdf","startPage":"2604","endPage":"2609","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Training Sequence for Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Fading","Transmitters","Maximum likelihood estimation","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training sequence","carrier frequency offset","channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple input multiple output technology","data transmission","fading channels","Cramer- Rao bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Training Sequence for Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289102/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875122","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Training Sequence for Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S04P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083764S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289108,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The UEP problem is reduced to the more general problem of finding a path in a graph, where each path of the graph represents a possible protection policy and the best path is that one inducing minimal distortion. The problem is combinatorially complex and excludes a brute force approach. The solution is provided by applying heuristic information from the problem domain to reduce search complexity. In particular, we use graph search procedure A, well known in the field of artificial intelligence, to avoid exhaustive search. Numerical results show that this technique outperforms the methods presented in [1], [2], in terms of mean square error (MSE) distortion and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.449","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of Optimal Distortion-Based Protection in Progressive Image Transmission: a Heuristic Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Determination of Optimal Distortion-Based Protection in Progressive Image Transmission: a Heuristic Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289120/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875140","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of Optimal Distortion-Based Protection in Progressive Image Transmission: a Heuristic Approach","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S05P18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138508S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289125,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is then natural to ask for the optimal constellation design which minimizes the BER. We develop an iterative algorithm to find such optimal solution for any one or higher dimensional rectangular PAM/QAM with arbitrary code mapping. As it turns out, the uniform constellation is not optimal even for Gray codes, especially in the low SNR region. And the performance improvement for some code mapping schemes after the optimization can be as much as over 20%. Furthermore, as bit rate gets lower, an interesting clustering phenomenon results in the optimal solution. Simulation results back up the advantages of our optimization method. The result obtained in this paper can be applied to the design of practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.457","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289128.pdf","startPage":"2749","endPage":"2754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Constellation for General Rectangular PAM/QAM with Arbitrary Code Mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289128/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Constellation for General Rectangular PAM/QAM with Arbitrary Code Mapping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875148","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289128/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Constellation for General Rectangular PAM/QAM with Arbitrary Code Mapping","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S05P26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048842S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289130,"authors":[{"name":"P.

MB-MIMO is a pre-coding MIMO scheme that uses a simple combination of multi-beam multiple-data-stream transmission and user equipment (UE)- based adaptive beam selection. The scheme benefits from its simple uplink feedback signalling, because MB-MIMO requires only a subset of the beam indices to be fed back. In this paper via computer simulation, we compare the performance of MB-MIMO and closed-loop MIMO that utilizes antenna selection only without beam-forming at the transmitter. In this comparison we consider the correlation between antenna elements in a temporally and spatially dispersed multi-path channel. Simulation results revealed that MB-MIMO has superior performance due to its beam-forming gain, even with limited feedback signalling. In this paper, we also introduce the MB-MIMO scheme using the cross-polarized (X-pol) antenna arrays and demonstrate its throughput performance comparing to the MB-MIMO using the 4-antenna linear array.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.463","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289134.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"2785","endPage":"2790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Performance of Pre-coding MIMO Transmission with Multi-Beam Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Performance of Pre-coding MIMO Transmission with Multi-Beam Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289134/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875154","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Performance of Pre-coding MIMO Transmission with Multi-Beam Selection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S06P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073213S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289135,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Lee and N. Jindal (Jul. 2006), M. Mohseni, et al. (Aug. 2006). However, due to the non-linear nature of the problem, convex optimization techniques have to be used, resulting in a high computational complexity. In this paper, the power minimization problem using dirty paper coding (DPC) is investigated. The SNR is distributed equally among the subchannels of each user to reduce each user's transceiver complexity, through the use of equal-rate modulation. The zero-forcing (ZF)-DPC problem is considered, therefore facilitating a closed form solution and resulting in a simple implementation. The optimum encoding order can be found with limited computations. To further reduce the complexity, a simple suboptimal method for finding the encoding order is given. This method is shown to have a sum power very close to the ZF-optimal power. The advantages of the methods proposed are their non-iterative nature and much reduced computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Power Minimization for MIMO Broadcast Channels with BD-GMD","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.464","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289135.pdf","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Power Minimization for MIMO Broadcast Channels with BD-GMD","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289135/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875155","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Power Minimization for MIMO Broadcast Channels with BD-GMD","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S06P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063742S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289136,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper also presents efficient methods to reduce the computational load of the algorithm by interpolating the precoding and decoding matrices corresponding to different OFDM subcarriers.

In this paper, we compare two air interfaces of particular interest for the uplink: cyclic-prefix code-division multiple access (CP-CDMA) proposed in the literature as an evolution of direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) because it enables the low complexity equalization of the multipath channel in the frequency domain, and single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA), recently proposed in the long term evolution of the 3GPP standard because it enables the easy separation of the users in the frequency domain. We demonstrate analytically that SC-FDMA is a special case of CP-CDMA, in which the CDMA codes have been optimized to minimize the symbol estimation mean square error (MSE) under a constraint of received power. Numerical results show that SC-FDMA outperforms significantly CP-CDMA at high user loads. The transmit power necessary to fulfill the received power constraint is higher in case of SC-FDMA than in case of CP-CDMA when the carrier sub-sets are allocated randomly to the users, and lower when the carrier sub-sets are allocated in an optimized way.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289137.pdf","startPage":"2803","endPage":"2808","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Carrier FDMA versus Cyclic-Prefix CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiaccess","Multiaccess communication","Frequency domain analysis","Constraint optimization","Quality of service","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Multipath channels","Long Term Evolution","Code standards","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","frequency division multiple access","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single carrier FDMA","cyclic prefix CDMA","data rate","quality of service","cellular systems","air interfaces","3GPP standard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Single-Carrier FDMA versus Cyclic-Prefix CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289137/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875157","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Carrier FDMA versus Cyclic-Prefix CDMA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S07P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057198S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289138,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the first approach we consider a common FIR preceding filter for all users, and jointly minimize the probability of error of all users. In the second approach, we assume separate precoders for each user which are obtained by minimizing the probability of error for the respective user. In order to fully utilize the knowledge available at the transmitter, in both the approaches, the filter weights are computed conditioned on the transmitted bit vector sequence. This also makes the computation of the optimal prefilter coefficients linear in the number of users.

The scheme eliminates the need of an IFFT block while keeping the low number of parameters to be estimated for low complexity without sacrificing the performance and convergence speed. For fast convergence and high performance, we develop a linearized cost function of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), sampling clock frequency offset (SFO) and channel impulse response (CIR) coefficients based on received signal samples and pilot tones in frequency domain and the corresponding recursive least square (RLS) estimation and tracking algorithm. For channel responses, CIR coefficients are estimated to benefit their low number and then transformed to the channel transfer function in order to keep low complexity. The ICI introduced by rotation due to CFO and SFO is analyzed and modeled, and a simple maximum-likelihood (ML) scheme based on the preamble is developed for coarse estimation of initial CFO and SFO values to be used in suppression of dominant ICI effects and in fine RLS estimation and tracking. Simulation results demonstrate that, in large practical ranges of CFO and SFO values, the proposed pilot-aided joint channel estimation and synchronization scheme provides a receiver performance remarkably close to the ideal case of perfect channel estimation and synchronization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289143.pdf","startPage":"2841","endPage":"2846","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Synchronization with Inter-carrier Interference Reduction for OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","Convergence","Resonance light scattering","Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","least squares approximations","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","recursive estimation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","joint channel synchronization scheme","intercarrier interference suppression","burst-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","OFDM systems","linearized cost function","carrier frequency offset","sampling clock frequency offset","channel impulse response","recursive least square estimation","channel transfer function","maximum-likelihood scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Synchronization with Inter-carrier Interference Reduction for OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289143/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875163","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Synchronization with Inter-carrier Interference Reduction for OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055507S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289144,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this context, OFDM is considered as a promising air interface candidate for both indoor and outdoor communications. Besides spectral efficiency and power consumption, the production cost of the transceiver should also be optimized. Direct-conversion radio frequency receivers are appealing because they avoid costly intermediate frequency hardware. However, they imply analog IQ separation, introducing a phase and amplitude mismatch between the I and Q branches. A communication system based on OFDM is sensitive to synchronization errors, such as CFO, and to front-end non-idealities, such as IQ imbalance. The goal of this paper is to use the iterative EM algorithm to acquire jointly the CFO and the IQ imbalance. The solution relies on a repetitive preamble and does not require the knowledge of the propagation channel. Based on a second order approximation of the likelihood function, the complexity of the EM algorithm is significantly reduced. The algorithm is shown to perform extremely well: the estimates of the CFO and of the IQ imbalance converge to their ML estimate after less than 3 iterations. While the CFO estimate is robust against variations of the SNR, the IQ imbalance estimate accuracy is reduced at values of the SNR below 10 dB and above 35 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.477","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289148.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"2871","endPage":"2876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity EM-based Joint CFO and IQ imbalance Acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity EM-based Joint CFO and IQ imbalance Acquisition","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289148/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875167","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity EM-based Joint CFO and IQ imbalance Acquisition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S08P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067426S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289149,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we analyze the cost function of the NSE, and show that the full performance NSE is complexity reducible, which can indeed lead to a common null space based estimator (CNSE). Also, we develop a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), and prove that the CNSE is equivalent to the MLE. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao bound of CFO estimation in the presence of DCO is given.

An OFDM system is considered where some periodic training symbols are sent as preamble. The proposed approach reduces the carrier acquisition problem to the frequency estimation of a set of complex tones with the same frequency. Then, a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is derived, which offers very good performance in low SNR multipath scenarios. The major part of the computations needed in the proposed algorithm can be efficiently carried out in the FFT processor already available in any OFDM receiver.

The cost function for CFO estimation is a determinant of a matrix, which is a function of the CFO. The CFO estimator does the estimation by performing a linear search and the search point which minimizes the determinant is the estimated CFO. The matrix corresponding to the estimated CFO is used for channel estimation, where the channel impulse response (CIR) is obtained as the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of that matrix. Time synchronization is inherently done along with the channel estimation, assuming the maximum channel order for all user channels is known. We also modify the existing estimator based on generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) and show the performance improvement through computer simulations. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the modified generalized eigenvalue problem method (MGEVPM). Computer simulations show that the proposed estimator performs better than MGEVPM and has wider CFO acquisition range than MGEVPM. Using Taylor's series approximation, we reformulate the proposed estimator in order to reduce the computational complexity. Through computer simulations we show that the performance of the reformulated estimator improves with increase in the order of Taylor's series and performs better than MGEVPM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289154.pdf","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2911","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Data-Aided Synchronization and Channel Estimation for Asynchronous CDMA Uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiaccess communication","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computer simulation","Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","Taylor series","Delay estimation","Delay effects","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","multiuser channels","series (mathematics)","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization","channel estimation","asynchronous CDMA uplink","joint time delay","carrier frequency offset","channel impulse response","eigenvector","generalized eigenvalue problem","CFO acquisition","Taylor series approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Non-Data-Aided Synchronization and Channel Estimation for Asynchronous CDMA Uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289154/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875172","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Data-Aided Synchronization and Channel Estimation for Asynchronous CDMA Uplink","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S09P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047182S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289155,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this context, the present paper relies on limited- rate feedback (LRF) sent from the access point to terminals to acquire quantized channel state information (CSI) in order to minimize the total average transmit-power under individual average rate and error probability constraints. Specifically, we introduce two suboptimal reduced-complexity schemes to: (i) allocate power, rate and subcarriers across users; and (ii) design accordingly the channel quantizer. The latter relies on the solution of (i) to design equally probable quantization regions per subcarrier and user. Numerical examples corroborate the analytical claims and reveal that the power savings achieved by our reduced-complexity LRF designs are close to those achieved by the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.484","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289155.pdf","startPage":"2912","endPage":"2917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Power-Efficient Wireless OFDMA using an Equally Probable CSI Quantizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289155/","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Power-Efficient Wireless OFDMA using an Equally Probable CSI Quantizer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875173","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289155/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Power-Efficient Wireless OFDMA using an Equally Probable CSI Quantizer","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S10P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098884S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289156,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The PAR can be globally minimized by distorting the OFDM constellation subject to a constraint on the error vector magnitude (EVM). In this paper, we demonstrate that an optimal amount of EVM exists for minimizing the transmitter power consumption while maintaining a constant bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. Alternatively, the EVM value may be chosen to maximize the channel capacity while maintaining a constant power consumption at the transmitter. Both EVM levels are only a function of the required signal-to-noise ratio at the OFDM receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.485","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"2918","endPage":"2923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing the Optimal Amount of Constellation Distortion in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computing the Optimal Amount of Constellation Distortion in OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289156/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875174","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289156/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing the Optimal Amount of Constellation Distortion in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S10P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042997S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289157,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper, a low complexity ICI reduction algorithm which can be applied to QAM signal constellations is proposed. A combinatorial optimization problem for ICI suppression is formulated and then relaxed to a quadratic programming problem. A successive method is then utilized to deduce a sequence of reduced-size QP problems, which is solved by limiting the search in the 2- dimensional subspace spanned by its steepest-descent and Newton directions to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, a low-bit descent search is employed to enhance the system performance. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide excellent performance with low computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289159.pdf","startPage":"2936","endPage":"2941","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Successive Intercarrier Interference Reduction Algorithm for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Fading","Quadratic programming","Quadrature amplitude modulation","System performance","OFDM modulation","Computational complexity","Constellation diagram","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","quadratic programming","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference reduction algorithm","OFDM systems","low complexity ICI reduction algorithm","QAM signal constellations","quadratic programming problem","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Successive Intercarrier Interference Reduction Algorithm for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289159/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875177","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Successive Intercarrier Interference Reduction Algorithm for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S10P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115697S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289160,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

In this redundant signal representation with no need for side information, the expanded constellation of signalling points used on each OFDM subcarrier is comprised of a conventional modulation scheme such as PSK or QAM and an external circle of alternative signalling points. The design of the expanded constellation maintains the minimum distance between signalling points and its advantage stems from the location of the alternative signalling point being radially symmetric to the original signalling point in the conventional constellation. Significant PAPR reduction is achieved by choosing for transmission signalling points which result in lower PAPRs. Specifically, the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the modified OFDM signal shows about a five (5) dB improvement in PAPR at clipping probability of 10 4 over the original OFDM signal. This performance is comparable to that in similar PAPR reduction schemes; however it is achieved at a significantly lower computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.489","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289160.pdf","startPage":"2942","endPage":"2948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative Symbol Representations with Radial Symmetry for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289160/","displayDocTitle":"Alternative Symbol Representations with Radial Symmetry for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875178","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289160/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative Symbol Representations with Radial Symmetry for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S10P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040191S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289162,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The low complexity is usually realized by the multiuser detector that applies an approximation similar to the rake receiver for CDMA systems. So far, this type of detector has been most frequently considered in IDMA literature.

The MMSE detector is more complex than the rake-like approximation. At the price of the complexity, however, it is shown that the MMSE detector brings several advantages over the rake-like approach such as the superior performance on channels with spectrally poor characteristics, effective iterative processing for lower SNR values, faster convergence and therefore shorter decoding delays, and better performance for short block length. We also confirm that the complexity can be drastically reduced by the low rank approximation of the MMSE filter by its multistage representation without compromising on the performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Interleave Division Multiple Access Based on Minimum Mean Square Error Detection","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.492","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289163.pdf","startPage":"2961","endPage":"2966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Interleave Division Multiple Access Based on Minimum Mean Square Error Detection","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289163/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Interleave Division Multiple Access Based on Minimum Mean Square Error Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S11P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049681S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed channel estimation technique exploits delay subspace structure in reducing the interference on channel estimation. The proposed pilot-based channel estimation technique initially estimates the multipath delay locations of both the desired and interference channels. In estimating multipath delays, we assume that the time-of-flight difference between the desired and interfering signals ensures that the multipath delay locations of the corresponding channels are distinct. This information is used to suppress interference in the multipath-delay domain, and define a channel interpolator with a lower normalized mean squared error (NMSE) when compared to the conventional modified least-squares technique (mLS). We also derive the analytical expression for the bit-error-rate of a zero- forcing (ZF) receiver based on the proposed channel estimator. In particular, we show that for uncoded OFDM, the match between the estimated BER and analytical BER is very good and the proposed estimator can outperform mLS by more than a order of magnitude in BER if the interference on the data subcarriers is significantly lower than the interference seen on the pilot subcarriers. Simulation results are also presented with turbo-coded OFDM which further demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Channel Estimation in Reuse-1 OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.498","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289169.pdf","startPage":"2999","endPage":"3004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Channel Estimation in Reuse-1 OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289169/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875187","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Channel Estimation in Reuse-1 OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S12P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10336S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289171,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We consider a situation where the receiver needs to estimate multipath channel with low complexity when only limited channel information is available. The proposed scheme relies on a recently proposed model, the Slepian basis expansion model, where Slepian sequences are used to exploit channel correlation in time. However, in slow fading channels, the length of the required Slepian sequence is very long and thus decoding complexity increases. To achieve accurate channel estimation with low complexity, we propose to utilize the Slepian sequences to exploit the frequency correlation of the channel. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator outperforms the channel estimator based on the exponential basis expansion model where the channel is approximated as a linear combination of complex exponential functions.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.500","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289171.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"3011","endPage":"3015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Domain Channel Estimation for OFDM Based on Slepian Basis Expansion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Domain Channel Estimation for OFDM Based on Slepian Basis Expansion","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289171/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875189","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Domain Channel Estimation for OFDM Based on Slepian Basis Expansion","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S12P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038842S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289172,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

The proposed technique keeping the comb-type pilot arrangement can achieve low error probability by accurately estimating channel impulse response (CIR) and effectively tracking rapid CIR variations. In addition, the LS CE technique proposed here is conducted in the time domain (TD); meanwhile, a generic estimator is, thus, performed serially block by block without assistance from a priori channel information and without increasing computational complexity. By taking advantage of linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) or pseudorandom signals that are transceived for the purpose of sounding pilot subchannels, the proposed LS channel estimator (CE) can inherently perform pseudo-noise (PN) matched filtering (MF) to suppress multipath interference (MPI) caused by frequency-selective fading and inter-carrier-interference (ICI) resulting from data subchannels. The dual optimality of the LFM and PN pilot symbols is verified for both time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) CEs. Furthermore, the proposed technique also exhibits good resistance against residual timing errors occurring with the DFT demodulation. Extensive computer simulations in conjunction with statistical derivations show the superiority of the proposed technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.501","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289172.pdf","startPage":"3016","endPage":"3023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS Channel Estimation for Mobile OFDM Communications on Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289172/","displayDocTitle":"LS Channel Estimation for Mobile OFDM Communications on Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875190","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289172/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS Channel Estimation for Mobile OFDM Communications on Time-Varying Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S12P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066306S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289173,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We employ a discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) to describe the time-varying channel. A periodic (non-random) training sequence is arithmetically added (superimposed) at low power to the information sequence at the transmitter before modulation and transmission. In existing first-order statistics-based channel estimators, the information sequence acts as interference resulting in a poor signal-to- noise ratio (SNR). In this paper a data-dependent superimposed training sequence is used to either totally or partially cancel out the effects of the unknown information sequence at the receiver on channel estimation. In total cancellation, at certain frequencies, the information-bearing components are nulled. To compensate for this information loss, we propose a partially-data- dependent (PDD) superimposed training scheme where a tradeoff is made between interference cancellation and frequency integrity. An iterative method is also used to enhance channel estimation and data detection and illustrated via a simulation example.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289174.pdf","startPage":"3028","endPage":"3033","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Interference Suppression in Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation Using Superimposed Training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Self-Interference Suppression in Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation Using Superimposed Training","htmlLink":"/document/4289174/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875192","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Interference Suppression in Doubly-Selective Channel Estimation Using Superimposed Training","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S13P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05082S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289174","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289175,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Existing DDCT algorithms like the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Al-Naffouri et al., 2002) suffer from error propagation and exhibit poor performance when applied to large frames at high fade rates. We propose a robust EM algorithm which mitigates the effect of error propagation and is able to track the channel in the decision directed mode even over frame durations experiencing 2-3 fade cycles. This EM algorithm uses the Huber's cost function in the maximization step instead of the non-robust least squares or Kalman cost function. Further, the noise variance is estimated using the robust median absolute deviation estimator instead of the standard maximum likelihood estimator. The proposed robust EM based DDCT scheme has a better error rate and MSE performance when compared to Kalman filter based pilot assisted channel tracking scheme with a 6.25% pilot overhead, even at a normalized Doppler of 0.04.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289178.pdf","startPage":"3051","endPage":"3056","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.507","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Statistics Based Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Channel Tracking in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Expectation-maximization algorithms","OFDM","Noise robustness","Maximum likelihood estimation","Working environment noise","Cost function","Channel estimation","Parameter estimation","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust statistics","expectation-maximization algorithm","OFDM systems","decision directed channel tracking","error propagation","Huber cost function","noise variance","robust median absolute deviation estimator","error rate","MSE performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Statistics Based Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Channel Tracking in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875196","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Statistics Based Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Channel Tracking in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S07S13P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106279S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289197,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In particular, retransmission (ARQ) protocols that typically reduce the transmission energy required to obtain a given error probability on the channel (at the expense of a larger delay), also increase the energy consumed by the circuitry other than the power amplifier. In this paper, the energy efficiency of hybrid-ARQ type I, chase combining and incremental redundancy protocols in Rayleigh fading channels, is analyzed by accounting for the energy consumed by the transmitting and receiving electronic circuitry. It is shown that the advantages of hybrid-ARQ protocols in terms of energy consumption strictly depend on the transmission range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289197/","accessionNumber":"9875215","displayDocTitle":"On the Energy Efficiency of Hybrid-ARQ Protocols in Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Energy Efficiency of Hybrid-ARQ Protocols in Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S03P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040933S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4289205,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These networks, due to their special functional characteristics, demand the implementation of energy-aware techniques in all layers. Recently a MIMO-based structure has been proposed to offer enhanced energy savings in WSNs under certain circumstances. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the dissipated power during a sensor node's operation, to prove that as microelectronics develop the MIMO - based architecture will outperform the equivalent SISO structure for almost any case, in terms of energy efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a simple Cooperative Node (CN) Selection algorithm to achieve additional energy gains in the MIMO approach along with enhanced network lifetime. We examine the scalability of the algorithm on different channel conditions and varying network density, and investigate the effect of the power dissipation analysis on its efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency of MIMO-based Sensor Networks with a Cooperative Node Selection Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.534","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289205.pdf","startPage":"3218","endPage":"3223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency of MIMO-based Sensor Networks with a Cooperative Node Selection Algorithm","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289205/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875223","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency of MIMO-based Sensor Networks with a Cooperative Node Selection Algorithm","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S03P15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053827S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4289212,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Hence, there is an interest in including parity bits in each packet for error control. From an information-theoretic perspective the most efficient usage of network capacity can be achieved by performing full encoding/decoding at each node and using a variable rate in accordance with the link-quality. However, such an approach represents a major burden on power-constrained sensors. In this paper, we propose a more practical approach that is based on optimally distributing iterative channel decoding over sensor networks. In such a paradigm, the guarantee with which the base station, or \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">collector</i>\n, gets the data from a sensor is a function of the processing within the intermediate nodes between source and destination (in-network processing). There are two extreme cases: a) Complete channel decoding at each hop and b) decoding only at the final destination. In this paper, we present a novel scheme in which intermediate nodes conduct partial decoding of LDPC coded packets. In this scheme each node is assigned some number of decoding iterations. The relay node conducts LPDC decoding for that number of iterations and forwards the packet, without ensuring a complete error correction. We show that such partial processing is sufficient to improve the end-to-end reliability significantly. Additionally, we show that it is feasible to tradeoff complexity/energy usage with distortion/reliability by varying the assignment of number of iterations. Finally, we present a low-complexity dynamic programming algorithm that optimally assigns iterations within the network to facilitate operation along an optimal \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">energy-distortion</i>\n curve.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.544","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289215.pdf","startPage":"3283","endPage":"3288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimally Mapping an Iterative Channel Decoding Algorithm to a Wireless Sensor Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289215/","displayDocTitle":"Optimally Mapping an Iterative Channel Decoding Algorithm to a Wireless Sensor Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875233","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289215/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimally Mapping an Iterative Channel Decoding Algorithm to a Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S03P25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052142S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289217,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, we address the problem of resource allocation for a set of heterogeneous multicast sessions over multihop wireless networks. We propose an iterative algorithm that achieves the optimal rates for a set of heterogeneous multicast sessions such that the aggregate utility for all sessions is maximized. We present the formulation of the multicast resource allocation problem as a non-linear optimization model and highlight the cross-layer framework that can solve this problem in a distributed ad hoc network environment with asynchronous computations. Our simulations show that the algorithm achieves optimal resource utilization, guarantees fairness among multicast sessions, provides flexibility in allocating rates over different parts of the multicast sessions and adapts to changing conditions such as dynamic channel capacity and node mobility. Our results show that the proposed algorithm not only provides flexibility in allocating resources across multicast sessions, but also increases the aggregate system utility and improves the overall system throughput by almost 30% compared to homogeneous multicast.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289244/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875262","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289244/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based Optimal Rate Allocation for Heterogeneous Wireless Multicast","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based Optimal Rate Allocation for Heterogeneous Wireless Multicast","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S07P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070636S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289272,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In order to detect an event, a sensor node spends most of the time in monitoring its environment, during which a significant amount of energy can be saved by placing the radio in the low power sleep mode when no reception and/or transmission of data is involved. In this paper, we discuss the design of a new MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks whose goal is to extend the lifetime of the network by avoiding major energy waste causes, such as collisions, overhearing and idle listening, without compromising other network performance measures such as network throughput. The performance of the protocol is studied by simulation and is compared to that of the well known S-MAC protocol which is designed to save energy and to the IEEE 802.11 protocol which is designed to maximize throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.601","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289272.pdf","startPage":"3648","endPage":"3653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"O-MAC: An Organized Energy-Aware MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"O-MAC: An Organized Energy-Aware MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289272/","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875290","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"O-MAC: An Organized Energy-Aware MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S12P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067885S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289274,"authors":[{"name":"B.

However, current IEEE 802.11 legacy MAC is designed without taking into consideration the interference cancellation capability of MIMO, thereby resulting in suboptimal use of bandwidth spectrum. In this paper, to fully exploit the spatial dimension of freedom offered by MIMO, we propose a methodology that takes into account the spatial correlation between the signal and interference in the design of MIMO ad hoc networks. Through analysis of the effect of spatial correlations on the system throughput, we conclude that it is a crucial factor that cannot be ignored when optimizing the transmission of the networks. Against this backdrop, we propose and investigate a specific MAC protocol for the transmission in a MIMO ad hoc network which 1) allows links to contend for the channel sequentially and transmit data packets simultaneously, yielding more than 35% throughput improvement compared to the system wherein only one link transmits at a time; 2) closely follows the 802.11 DCF (distributed coordination function), allowing simpler implementation as compared to previously proposed MAC protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.603","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289274.pdf","startPage":"3660","endPage":"3665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Media Access Control with Spatial Correlation for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289274/","displayDocTitle":"Media Access Control with Spatial Correlation for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875292","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289274/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Media Access Control with Spatial Correlation for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S12P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063029S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289278,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It has been mainly applied to single-input single-output (SISO) systems, in which each node is equipped with a single antenna. In this paper, we study MAC protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with MIMO (multi-input multi-output) capability. In particular, we consider the integration of MIMO into two MAC protocols. The first protocol is the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is a conservative protocol that does not use TPC. The second protocol is POWMAC, which exploits TPC to maximize the perceived throughput. We refer to these protocols when applied to MIMO systems as MIMO-802.11 and MIMO-POWMAC. We compare the performance of MIMO-802.11 and MIMO- POWMAC with SISO-802.11 and SISO-POWMAC, in terms of the perceived throughput and energy consumption. Our simulations reveal that although the MIMO system doubles the bit rate per link over the SISO system, the network throughput is not necessarily doubled due a reduction in the number of concurrent transmissions. In addition, the throughput gains in the MIMO system come at a non-negligible energy cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289278.pdf","startPage":"3686","endPage":"3691","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Oriented Power Control in MIMO-Based Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Ad hoc networks","MIMO","Throughput","Media Access Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks","Energy consumption","Bit rate","Receiving antennas","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","energy consumption","MIMO communication","mobile radio","power control","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput-oriented power control","transmission power control","wireless ad hoc networks","energy consumption reduction","MAC protocols","mobile ad hoc networks","IEEE 802.11 standard","MIMO-802.11","MIMO-POWMAC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Oriented Power Control in MIMO-Based Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875296","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Oriented Power Control in MIMO-Based Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S13P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05886S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289279,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The relay channel used operates in what is termed as MIMO cooperative diversity mode, where the source transmits to both relay and destination terminals in the first instance.

Initially the cooperative diversity framework is introduced to consider system constraints so a direct and fair comparison with the single-hop case can be made. In-particular a power constraint is placed on the system and the optimal transmit power levels are derived and presented. The derived technique for finding the optimal transmit power levels is then used to demonstrate the advantages of using cooperative diversity in a wireless network. The results presented show that MIMO cooperative diversity offers a 3.4 dB increase in spectral efficiency at 5 % outage, with no additional cost incurred in transmit time, power or bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.608","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"3692","endPage":"3697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Cooperative Diversity in a Transmit Power Limited Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Cooperative Diversity in a Transmit Power Limited Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289279/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875297","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289279/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Cooperative Diversity in a Transmit Power Limited Environment","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S13P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0561S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289291,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, a contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocol, called receiver sense multiple access (RSMA), is proposed for the last-hop client-to-router communications. RSMA can minimize control packet collisions and achieve collision-free data packet transmissions. A rigorous mathematical model is developed for performance analysis in a scenario with hidden terminals.

In contrast to previous work, in our model hopping takes place at the symbol level. As a result, different interference levels are encountered across a codeword/packet, creating interference diversity which is exploited through coding. Moreover, the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas which can be used for further error protection or increase of the transmission rate through space-time block coding or spatial multiplexing, respectively. Assuming an infinite network of terminals, modelled as a Poisson random field, the performance is evaluated in terms of the product (spectral efficiency) times (distance), often referred to as information efficiency. With a cross-layer design perspective in mind, results are presented for various combinations of routing strategies, MIMO techniques and code diversity orders.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.625","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289296.pdf","startPage":"3793","endPage":"3798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Efficiency of Ad Hoc Networks with FH-MIMO Transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289296/","displayDocTitle":"Information Efficiency of Ad Hoc Networks with FH-MIMO Transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875314","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289296/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Efficiency of Ad Hoc Networks with FH-MIMO Transceivers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S16P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086379S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289308,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Sensor nodes learn to monitor their environment in a low-power \"sleep\" mode, until an intruder is detected, then enter a full-power mode only if the benefit for doing so outweighs an energy cost. Our formulation accounts for the energy required to transmit and the probability of successful transmission in a crowded ZigBee network. Since these depend on the activity of other nodes, we propose a decentralized adaptive algorithm for sensor activation based on game theoretic principles. We show that the algorithm tracks the time-varying set of correlated equilibria of the problem, and illustrate performance through simulation. The algorithm is described as a stochastic approximation, with attendant differential inclusion analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289316/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875334","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289316/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Activation in a ZigBee-enabled Unattended Ground Sensor Network: A Correlated Equilibrium Game Theoretic Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Activation in a ZigBee-enabled Unattended Ground Sensor Network: A Correlated Equilibrium Game Theoretic Analysis","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S19P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060944S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289322,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that enable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative nodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by using the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load or even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery life. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks, if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk network and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875340","htmlLink":"/document/4289322/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks by Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks by Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S08S20P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049171S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289325,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In our current work, we propose an inter-vehicle ad-hoc routing protocol called GyTAR (improved greedy traffic aware routing protocol) suitable for city environments. GyTAR consists of two modules: (i) dynamic selection of the junctions through which a packet must pass to reach its destination, and (ii) an improved greedy strategy used to forward packets between two junctions. In this paper, we give detailed description of our approach and present its added value compared to other existing vehicular routing protocols.

To measure the effect of these design tradeoffs, we develop and define a metric called the \"price of a feature.\" This metric is used to quantify the effect of these properties on a cognitive network with the objective of maximizing the lifetime of a multicast flow in a wireless environment.

We circumvent this deficiency by proposing a three-stage turbo-detected sphere packing (SP) aided space-time block coding (STBC) STBC-SP scheme, where a rate-1 recursive inner precoder is employed to avoid having a BER floor. The convergence behaviour of this serially concatenated scheme is investigated with the aid of 3D extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Furthermore, the capacity of the STBC-SP scheme is shown and an algorithm is proposed for calculating a tighter upper bound on the maximum achievable bandwidth efficiency. The proposed three-stage turbo-detected scheme operates within about 1.0 dB of the capacity and within 0.5 dB of the maximum achievable bandwidth efficiency limit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Convolutional codes","Modulation coding","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Concatenated codes","Upper bound","Diversity reception","Convergence","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","curve fitting","design","error statistics","modulation coding","space-time codes","transceivers","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-capacity transceiver design","exit-curve fitting","turbo detection","irregular convolutional coding","joint sphere-packing modulation","space-time coding","bit error rate floor","space-time block coding","recursive inner precoder","convergence behaviour","3D extrinsic information transfer charts"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289334","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.663","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289334.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.663","startPage":"4028","endPage":"4033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Capacity Transceiver Design Using Exit-Curve Fitting: Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Capacity Transceiver Design Using Exit-Curve Fitting: Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289334/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289334/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875352","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Capacity Transceiver Design Using Exit-Curve Fitting: Three-Stage Turbo Detection of Irregular Convolutional Coded Joint Sphere-Packing Modulation and Space-Time Coding","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S01P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089037S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289336,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Complex-valued spreading codes, particularly polyphase codes, are investigated based on a system model in which modulation formats, equalization/combining schemes, and fading statistics are general. Different from previous approaches, we pay special attention to the influence of channel correlation on the performance of spreading codes and try to take advantage of the channel correlation in the design of spreading codes. We begin by considering a worst-case frequency-selective fading channel characterized by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading for all subcarriers. Unitary polyphase spreading codes are proven to be optimal among all polyphase codes for the i.i.d. fading channel. Next, optimal spreading codes for a two-user case are derived analytically. We proceed to consider a block-wise correlated fading channel model. We propose a class of channel-correlation- matched Kronecker-product unitary spreading codes, which can exploit the channel correlation, thereby reducing multiple access interference (MAI) significantly. Finally, we extend the Welch lower bound to the downlink of MC-CDMA over correlated fading channels and investigate the performance of Welch bound equality codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Matched Spreading Codes for the Downlink of MC-CDMA","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.670","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289341.pdf","startPage":"4070","endPage":"4075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Channel-Matched Spreading Codes for the Downlink of MC-CDMA","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289341/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Matched Spreading Codes for the Downlink of MC-CDMA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S03P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044031S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289343,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We introduce the transmission rate improvement by capitalizing on the assignment of additional spreading codes to each user so as to expand the cardinality of space-time code matrix. Given perfect channel state information at the receiver, a simple linear frequency-domain interference suppression scheme on a basis of symbol-by-symbol processing is developed under certain circumstances. A soft receiver is facilitated by exploiting the serially concatenated structure at the transmitter to further enhance system performance. Simulation results justify the efficacy of our proposed system and also present performance comparison with well-known OFDM systems in terms of bit error rate (BER).","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289344.pdf","startPage":"4087","endPage":"4092","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Interference Suppression for High-Rate Single-Carrier Space-Time Block-Coded CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Bit error rate","Block codes","Intersymbol interference","Delay","Space time codes","Channel state information","Concatenated codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","space-time codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative interference suppression","high-rate single-carrier space-time block-code","CDMA","time-reversal space-time block coding","single-carrier direct sequence code-division multiple access","DS-CDMA","multiple access interference","MAI","intersyrnbol interference","spreading codes","perfect channel state information","linear frequency-domain interference suppression scheme","symbol-by-symbol processing","transmitter","bit error rate","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Interference Suppression for High-Rate Single-Carrier Space-Time Block-Coded CDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289344/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875362","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Interference Suppression for High-Rate Single-Carrier Space-Time Block-Coded CDMA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S03P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059403S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289345,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The fractional channel reservation (FCR) scheme is also used in the proposed CAC strategy as a system capacity booster. The proposed CAC strategy is mathematically analyzed by means of a teletraffic analysis considering both soft handoff and users' mobility. Realistic mobility conditions are taken into account by characterizing users' mobility parameters considering a smooth random mobility model.

In this paper, by exploiting the IF-sampling principle, we propose a novel receiver architecture, which typically consists of a mixer with local input of a fixed down-converting frequency, followed by some filter banks.

However soft outputs are required in practical systems to fully exploit gains from forward error correction. Due to the non-linear nature of LR aided MIMO detection, generating soft information on the estimates it provides is not trivial. Consequently this problem has not been treated much in the literature. In this paper we present two related algorithms for computing soft outputs on estimates of LR-aided MIMO detection. It is shown through computer simulations that the proposed soft output generation algorithms allow LR-aided MIMO detection to achieve near- optimal performance for coded systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289354.pdf","startPage":"4144","endPage":"4149","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Generating Soft Outputs for Lattice-Reduction-Aided MIMO Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Forward error correction","Maximum likelihood decoding","Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","Communications Society","Europe","Lattices","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice-reduction-aided MIMO detection","forward error correction","soft output generation algorithm","computer simulation","coded systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Generating Soft Outputs for Lattice-Reduction-Aided MIMO Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875372","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Generating Soft Outputs for Lattice-Reduction-Aided MIMO Detection","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S05P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074639S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289355,"authors":[{"name":"E.

With a unified design of the BP detector, a multi-rate MIMO system adaptive to channel variations is then developed, which aims at achieving the maximal throughput performance. The usage of the unified BP detector eliminates the multiple detector modules at the receiver in conventional multi-mode adaptive MIMO systems. Further, the linear complexity to space time block length and parallel operation of the unified BP detection provide the advantages of low complexity, low detection delay and smooth switching between different data rates. With the average receiving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based switching mechanism, the proposed adaptive MIMO framework adaptively chooses the appropriate rate for the transmission.

Four different-rate Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) constituent-codes are used by the MLC scheme. The performance of the resultant equivalent capacity based design is characterized using simulation results.

We analyze this modified channel in terms of its channel transfer function and fading correlation in time and frequency direction. We will see, that the fading correlation factorizes into an antenna related part and a propagation channel part. This is, the transmitter does not require any information about the channel itself in order to design roots in the correlation function. This analysis yields a guidance for the choice of the antenna configuration parameters, which is the goal of this paper. The proper choice of these parameters (cyclic delays, Doppler shifts) allows for reducing respectively removing fading correlation in time and/or frequency direction, and therefore, optimizing diversity gains.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.689","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289360.pdf","startPage":"4179","endPage":"4184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Influence of Cyclic Delay Diversity and Doppler Diversity on the Channel Characteristics in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289360/","displayDocTitle":"On the Influence of Cyclic Delay Diversity and Doppler Diversity on the Channel Characteristics in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875378","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289360/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Influence of Cyclic Delay Diversity and Doppler Diversity on the Channel Characteristics in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S06P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043293S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289364,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, due to low spectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential for use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed protocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and lower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative transmission protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.698","startPage":"4232","endPage":"4236","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289369.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols with High Spectral Efficiency and High Diversity Order Using Multiuser Detection and Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Multiuser detection","Network coding","Relays","Peer to peer computing","Decoding","Base stations","MIMO","Data engineering","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error statistics","protocols","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative transmission protocols","spectral efficiency","diversity order","multiuser detection","network coding","wireless channels","orthogonal channels","wireless networks","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols with High Spectral Efficiency and High Diversity Order Using Multiuser Detection and Network Coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289369/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875387","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Transmission Protocols with High Spectral Efficiency and High Diversity Order Using Multiuser Detection and Network Coding","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S07P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069144S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289371,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Different from the previous contributions, our work focuses on downlink for the following reasons: first, downlink has always been the bottleneck of capacity due to asymmetry in traffic loads between downlink and uplink; second, the simplicity of MRC MIMO present more attractiveness in downlink for the strict complexity restriction on mobile stations. We analyze the impact of intra-cell interference as well as inter-cell interference on system performance and derive the outage probability and capacity of the system in a closed-form. Then we compare the performance between MRC-MIMO-CDMA and single input single output (SISO) CDMA systems in respect of outage probability and capacity. The results indicate the efficiency predominance of MRC- MIMO-CDMA over SISO and show that employing more transmit antennas at the base station brings on better performance than using more receive antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.700","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"4243","endPage":"4248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximal Ratio Combining in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Downlink Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximal Ratio Combining in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Downlink Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289371/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875389","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289371/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal Ratio Combining in Cellular MIMO-CDMA Downlink Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S08P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052949S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289372,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The CDMA2000 gateway (PDSN) node is constructed with superior service-rate compared to its downstream core node (PCF). The rate mismatch further allows for traffic load variations and subsequent congestion at the core node. The use of a Xoff/Xon feedback flow control in CDMA2000 was proposed at the 3GPP2. We evaluate the 3GPP2 backpressure proposal for protecting the bottleneck queue during heavy congestion conditions. We devise an adaptive-Xoff/Xon for tandem queues, which extends the traditional Xoff/Xon to provide threshold adaptation according to overflow prediction. The adaptive-Xoff/Xon complements the RED AQM at the bottleneck node, creating a hybrid flow-control model for tandem nodes. Experimental results show that the hybrid flow-control model eliminates packet discards due to overflow at the bottleneck queue, improves throughput, and lowers the overall data packets drop volume. Packets show to not experience backpressure-based delay variation while traversing the tandem queues. An associated cost is low volume of feedback control packets. Larger tandem-queues' average-delays are observed, which result with lower power-function. Hence, degraded combined performances are delivered by the 3GPP2 proposal for backpressure.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.701","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"4249","endPage":"4256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Flow-Control for CDMA2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Flow-Control for CDMA2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289372/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875390","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Flow-Control for CDMA2000","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S08P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064433S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289373,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The LLR is obtained based on an enhanced estimate of the variance of the multiple- access interference (MAI) and residual MAI (RMAI) plus noise. The (R)MAI terms are modeled as conditionally Gaussian with a time-dependent variance that is a function of the user cross-correlations and fading coefficients. Significant performance gains due to the improved LLR's are realized over PPIC schemes using fixed variance estimates in frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading channels. The performance gap is greater when two stages of the improved PPIC are used. Reduced complexity forms of the variance estimates and LLR's are proposed and also shown to give a performance advantage.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.702","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"4257","endPage":"4262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability-based Partial Parallel Interference Cancellation and Iterative Decoding for DS-CDMA over Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability-based Partial Parallel Interference Cancellation and Iterative Decoding for DS-CDMA over Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289373/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875391","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability-based Partial Parallel Interference Cancellation and Iterative Decoding for DS-CDMA over Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S08P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053866S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289374,"authors":[{"name":"M.

ZP-OFDM offers potentially superior performance in multipath channels only if more complex equalization, such as minimum-mean- squared-error (MMSE) or least-squares (LS) is performed at the receiver instead of the more commonly used overlap-add (OLA) equalizer. These complex schemes usually involve inversion of a non-diagonal, channel-dependent matrix that cannot be precomputed. In this paper we first develop two simplified algorithms for equalization of uncoded OFDM signals that improve performance in channels with spectral nulls compared to the OLA equalizer. We then develop a novel, iterative metric-calculation method for coded OFDM that with proper initialization requires only two iterations to approach the performance of a LS equalizer, without the need for matrix inversions. Simulation results will be presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289374.pdf","startPage":"4263","endPage":"4268","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Equalization For Coded, Zero-Padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Equalizers","Iterative algorithms","Convolution","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative methods","Iterative decoding","Communications Society","USA Councils","Telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex equalization","coded OFDM systems","zero-padded OFDM systems","wireless systems","multiband-OFDM","WiMedia standard","cyclic-prefix OFDM","multipath channels","minimum-mean-squared-error","least-squares equalizer","iterative metric"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improved Equalization For Coded, Zero-Padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289374/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875392","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Equalization For Coded, Zero-Padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S08P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058367S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289375,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In our precoder, mean-feedback precoding or covariance-feedback precoding, is adaptively chosen at the user terminal. The maximum achievable signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is used as the precoding-mode selection criterion. Each user calculates the selection metric and decides whether mean feedback is necessary. We confirm the intuition that mean-feedback precoding offers BER gains over covariance-feedback precoding when mean feedback becomes sufficiently accurate. Our adaptive precoding outperforms either mean-feedback precoding or covariance-feedback precoding in multiuser OSTBC OFDM, and considerably reduces the bit error rate (BER).

In uplink, this scheme acts as the detection at the receiver, while in downlink, it acts as the preceding at the transmitter. Moreover, by the studies of the convergence behavior of the iterations, a sufficient condition for the convergence is given, and it is proved that this iterative scheme is equivalent to the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme, but with much lower complexity. The simulation results indicate that due to the uplink-downlink duality, this iterative scheme can effectively suppress the ICI due to CFO in both uplink and downlink.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink-Downlink Duality of ICI Cancellation in OFDMA Systems with Carrier-Frequency Offset","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.712","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289383.pdf","startPage":"4317","endPage":"4322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Uplink-Downlink Duality of ICI Cancellation in OFDMA Systems with Carrier-Frequency Offset","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289383/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875401","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink-Downlink Duality of ICI Cancellation in OFDMA Systems with Carrier-Frequency Offset","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S10P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05142S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289384,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The OFDM alternative provides a simple receiver implementation which allows good performances, by exploiting the channel coding effort, but is known to suffer from a high PMEPR (peak-to-mean envelope power ratio), leading to power amplification difficulties. The SC/FDE (frequency-domain equalization) alternative is easily compatible with low PMEPR values, but the FDE (MMSE) receiver performance is known to be far from the optimum. In this paper, we consider a reduced-PMEPR, clipped-OFDM transmission , where an advanced receiver performs the iterative cancellation of the deliberate nonlinear distortion effects. In parallel, we consider an advanced turbo FDE receiver, as well as simplified iterative FDE receiver implementations, within the SC alternative. The \"SC vs OFDM\" comparisons of this paper, under the use of iterative receiver techniques in both cases, show a very significant overall advantage for the SC side.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Clipped-OFDM and SC/FDE Alternatives for Block Transmission Using Iterative Receiver Techniques","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.713","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289384.pdf","startPage":"4323","endPage":"4328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Clipped-OFDM and SC/FDE Alternatives for Block Transmission Using Iterative Receiver Techniques","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289384/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875402","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Clipped-OFDM and SC/FDE Alternatives for Block Transmission Using Iterative Receiver Techniques","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S10P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044198S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289385,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

Sampling theory dictates that the pilot insertion frequency must be above the Nyquist rates in both time and frequency to avoid aliasing of the delay-Doppler response. Based on the regularly spaced pilot pattern, we can derive alternative patterns that preserve the non-aliasing property by hopping the scan lines in either time domain or frequency domain, but not both. From this extended set of patterns, we find ones with properties that, in addition to channel estimation, can achieve responsively other synchronization tasks such as initial time-frequency offset estimation and device identification. The ambiguity function analysis frequently used in radar signal design leads to a periodic time-hopping pattern based on the costas array that has minimal coincidences with its circular time-frequency shifts, which can be used for the identification of multiple devices. The hopping in time also greatly increases the pilot's time support, thus enabling the quick initial acquisition of timing and frequency offset with very short observation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289385.pdf","startPage":"4329","endPage":"4334","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization Signal Design for OFDM Based On Time-Frequency Hopping Patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","OFDM","Time frequency analysis","Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Sampling methods","Delay effects","Frequency domain analysis","Object recognition","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization signal design","OFDM system","time-frequency hopping patterns","time-frequency response","delay-Doppler response","channel estimation","ambiguity function analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization Signal Design for OFDM Based On Time-Frequency Hopping Patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875403","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization Signal Design for OFDM Based On Time-Frequency Hopping Patterns","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S10P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075432S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289386,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The main drawback of this technique is that, for each data block, it requires the transmission of several side information bits, which results in some data rate loss. These redundant bits are so critical to the error performance of the system that they need in practice to be protected by a powerful channel code. This increases the system complexity and transmission delay, and decreases the data rate even further. In this paper, we propose a novel SLM method for which no side information needs to be sent. By considering the example of an OFDM system using 16-QAM modulation, it is shown that the proposed method performs very well both in terms of PAPR reduction and bit error rate at the receiver output.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.716","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289387.pdf","startPage":"4341","endPage":"4345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM PAPR Reduction Using Selected Mapping Without Side Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289387/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM PAPR Reduction Using Selected Mapping Without Side Information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875405","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289387/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM PAPR Reduction Using Selected Mapping Without Side Information","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S10P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055353S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289388,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This scheme is a maximum likelihood approach that exploits the pilot subcarriers that exist in almost all practical OFDM systems.

Most of the existing work considers quasi-static channels and tries to suppress the common phase error (CPE). As will be shown in this paper, in more realistic fast time-varying channels, the CPE term becomes much more complex and might significantly degrade the performance of estimators that assume a time-invariant channel, (b) the proposed algorithm is applicable for the two most common types of local oscillators: phase-locked and free-running, which have different phase-noise characteristics, (c) the proposed phase-noise suppression scheme does not require perfect channel equalization, whereas in some of the existing work the channel is assumed to be known a priori, and (d) doubly-selective fading is considered rather than assuming a time-invariant and/or flat- fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.717","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289388.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"4346","endPage":"4350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Noise Suppression for OFDM Systems Over Fast Time-Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase Noise Suppression for OFDM Systems Over Fast Time-Varying Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289388/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875406","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289388/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Noise Suppression for OFDM Systems Over Fast Time-Varying Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S10P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064847S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289389,"authors":[{"name":"H.

For channels with uncorrelated paths, the preceding structure is composed of a number of parallel precoders designed for frequency-flat fading channels.

Two special scenarios of a double scattering channel model are analyzed: (i) an extremely rich scattering environment corresponding to a conventional semi-correlated Rayleigh fading channel whereby correlation is accounted for either among the transmitting or the receiving antennas and (ii) a rank-deficient keyhole channel with a single degree of freedom and zero correlation at both sides of the wireless link. For both fading scenarios, closed-form capacity expressions are derived in terms of a cut-off signal- to-noise ratio which must be solved for numerically. In the case of semi-correlated Rayleigh fading, the capacity expressions are obtained for two kinds of correlation structures, namely, a constant correlation model and an arbitrary correlation model, the latter being induced by a full-rank covariance matrix with non-repeating distinct eigenvalues. Monte Carlo simulations are also carried out thereby upholding our theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyholes on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.719","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289390.pdf","startPage":"4357","endPage":"4362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyholes on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289390/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Spatial Fading Correlation and Keyholes on the Capacity of MIMO Systems with Transmitter and Receiver CSI","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S11P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049181S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289391,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The channel knowledge here is the channel mean and transmit correlation information. The joint design is formulated into an optimization problem, to which the closed-form optimum solution is found. The optimum precoder consists of a linear filter, a matrix which collects effective channel eigenmodes, and a diagonal power allocation matrix. The linear filter balances the suppression of channel noise and the additional noise induced by channel estimation error. Given the precoder, the optimum decoder is simply a linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) data estimator. The performance degradations due to imperfect channel estimation and/or transmit correlation are demonstrated by simulation results. The relation between the minimum total MSE design and the maximum mutual information design is determined as well, under the above mentioned imperfect CSI.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO LMMSE Transceiver Design with Imperfect CSI at Both Ends","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.721","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289392.pdf","startPage":"4369","endPage":"4374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO LMMSE Transceiver Design with Imperfect CSI at Both Ends","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289392/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875410","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO LMMSE Transceiver Design with Imperfect CSI at Both Ends","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S11P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06405S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289393,"authors":[{"name":"E.

By utilizing marginal unordered eigenvalue distributions of complex noncentral Wishart matrices, we derive exact closed- form BER expression under the assumption of equal power allocation. Our results apply for various modulation formats and arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas. Our results show the average BER increases with channel estimation error, feedback delay and Ricean A'-factor at a polynomial rate that is inversely proportional to the difference between the numbers of transmit and receive antennas. We also show that the achievable BER performance is limited by the presence of an irreducible error floor as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289393.pdf","startPage":"4375","endPage":"4380","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Analysis of MIMO-SVD Systems with Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Feedback","Delay estimation","Receiving antennas","Performance analysis","MIMO","Fading","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","delays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","error statistics","feedback","MIMO communication","MIMO systems","modulation","Rician channels","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","MIMO-SVD systems","channel estimation error","feedback delay","bit error rate","singular value decomposition","multiple-input multiple-output systems","Ricean fading channels","Wishart matrices","equal power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"BER Analysis of MIMO-SVD Systems with Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875411","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Analysis of MIMO-SVD Systems with Channel Estimation Error and Feedback Delay","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S11P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084991S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289396,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This scheme achieves full rate and employs simple real-symbol-wise decoding. Two families of pulse shapes for the offset QAM signal are considered: i) pulse shapes with zero cross-channel interference (CCI) between I/Q-channels and ii) pulse shapes with controlled CCI. In the zero CCI case, the real-symbol-wise decoding is optimum and the bit error probability (BEP) performance is better than that of conventional full-rate, full-diversity quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes (QO-STBC), as well as rate-1/2 and rate-3/4 complex O-STBCs. To achieve good spectral confinement while maintaining decoding simplicity, we investigate pulse shapes that introduce a small amount of controlled CCI at the sampling instants so that some performance gains can be traded off. We derive a BEP upperbound for the case of nonzero CCI and formulate the design criteria on how to construct the two real O-STBCs on the I/Q channels in order to minimize the performance degradation caused by the controlled CCI. The optimum real O-STBCs are then identified and their BEP performance is compared with that of the benchmark schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289396.pdf","startPage":"4393","endPage":"4398","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Rate Real-Symbol-Decodable O-STBC with Offset QAM for Four Transmit Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitting antennas","Shape control","Radiofrequency interference","Pulse shaping methods","Decoding","Block codes","Error probability","Sampling methods","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","decoding","error statistics","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiofrequency interference","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-rate real-symbol-decodable O-STBC","transmit antennas","orthogonal space-time block codes","I-channels","Q-channels","pulse-shaped offset QAM","cross-channel interference","bit error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Full-Rate Real-Symbol-Decodable O-STBC with Offset QAM for Four Transmit Antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875414","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Rate Real-Symbol-Decodable O-STBC with Offset QAM for Four Transmit Antennas","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S12P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055496S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289398,"authors":[{"name":"S.

With SPC the phase relation of the signals between multiple transmit antennas is modified such that the probability of constructive superposition of the signals at the receiver antenna is increased. The principle is based on selective phase flipping. The promising feature of this scheme is that only the superimposed channel has to be estimated at the receiver and not all channels from the different transmit antennas. Moreover, it requires a very small amount of feedback information for pre-coding compared to existing solutions.

The generalized soft limiter (GSL) improves the accuracy of the reconstructed interference signals by making hard decisions on \"reliable\" signals and partial soft decisions on \"unreliable\" signals. The system performance degradation caused by imperfect amplitude estimation and near-far effects is also analyzed in the paper. It is also shown that GSL-PIC can achieve comparable performance to that of hyperbolic tangent decision PIC (HT-PIC), which has been shown to be the optimum decision for the single user case with Gaussian interference and noise. The advantage of the GSL is that it is much easier to implement than the HT. Both GSL-PIC and HT-PIC are shown to be able to achieve performance much better than other improved PIC techniques such as null-zone decision PIC (NZ-PIQ, soft-limiter PIC, and partial PIC (PPIC) in most scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved DS-CDMA Multi-stage PIC in Fading Channels using a Generalized Soft Limiter","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.737","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289408.pdf","startPage":"4462","endPage":"4467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improved DS-CDMA Multi-stage PIC in Fading Channels using a Generalized Soft Limiter","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289408/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875426","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved DS-CDMA Multi-stage PIC in Fading Channels using a Generalized Soft Limiter","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S14P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134913S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289410,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Most of existing FDE algorithms are limited to quasi-static or slow time-varying fading channels, where least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive algorithms were utilized for channel estimation. In this paper, we employ interpolation method to develop channel estimation algorithm in the frequency domain. We show that the new channel estimation algorithm can significantly outperform LMS and RLS algorithms. Numerical examples demonstrate that the new algorithm can track time-varying fading channels with Doppler up to 300-400 Hz. This means, for 1.9 GHz carrier frequency band, the new algorithm can provide good bit error rate performance even if the mobile is moving at a high speed of 170-228 kilo-meters per hour, while the fading channel impulse response is 60 taps long.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289410.pdf","startPage":"4475","endPage":"4480","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Broadband Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Broadband Wireless Communications","htmlLink":"/document/4289410/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875428","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Domain Channel Estimation and Equalization for Broadband Wireless Communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S14P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073703S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289411,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We consider three possible transmission schemes in multi- hop networks: single-hop, multi-hop, and multi-hop with spatial reuse of subcarriers. We verify that the required number of sub-carriers to guarantee the target BER and the target data rate is changed according to the transmission scheme and QoS requirements as well as the channel condition. Based on this result, we propose a new transmission scheme selection algorithm to select the best performance scheme for the efficient utilization of the limited subcarriers. Through the numerical results, the performance of this algorithm is demonstrated by the number of supported MSs in the system and the blocking probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.757","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289428.pdf","startPage":"4587","endPage":"4591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-guaranteed Transmission Scheme Selection for OFDMA Multi-hop Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289428/","displayDocTitle":"QoS-guaranteed Transmission Scheme Selection for OFDMA Multi-hop Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875446","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289428/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-guaranteed Transmission Scheme Selection for OFDMA Multi-hop Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S17P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050335S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289430,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This assumption is not always true. In a more general case of time-selective channel, the channel matrix is no longer orthogonal. If conventional linear decoder is applied as it is in the quasi-static channel, it will introduce an irreducible error floor. In order to improve the performance, we can use zero-forcing decoder, which completely removes the interference. In this paper, we analyze the average bit error performance for BOTH conventional linear and zero-forcing decoders in the time-selective channels. The closed-form average bit error probabilities are obtained for both decoders, together with the irreducible error floor for the conventional linear decoder. Asymptotic analysis and numerical examples are also provided.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.760","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289431.pdf","startPage":"4604","endPage":"4609","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Error Performance of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes over Time-Selective Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Performance of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes over Time-Selective Channel","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289431/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875449","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289431/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Performance of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes over Time-Selective Channel","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S18P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054206S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289433,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this work, however, we investigate MIMO channels where the fading is more severe. In these environments, we show that the coefficient of variation of the channel amplitudes is a good predictor of the link mutual information, for a variety of models. We propose a novel channel model for severely fading channels based on the complex multivariate t distribution. For this model, we are able to compute exact results for the ergodic mutual information and approximations to the outage probabilities for the mutual information. Applications of this work include wireless sensors, RF tagging, land-mobile, indoor-mobile, ground-penetrating radar, and ionospheric radio links. Finally, we point out that the methodology can also be extended to evaluate the mutual information of a cellular MIMO link and the performance of various MIMO receivers in a cellular scenario. In these cellular applications, the channel itself is not severely fading but the multivariate t distribution can be applied to model the effects of inter-cell interference.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.764","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289435.pdf","startPage":"4628","endPage":"4633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Severely Fading MIMO Channels: Models and Mutual Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289435/","displayDocTitle":"Severely Fading MIMO Channels: Models and Mutual Information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875453","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289435/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Severely Fading MIMO Channels: Models and Mutual Information","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S18P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053925S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289436,"authors":[{"name":"W.

With network coding, however, a packet has to wait to be network-coded with others given the stochastic nature of the packet arrival process of the various flows. This may result in large delay and packet-loss rate. To overcome this limitation, a novel network coding approach, which we shall refer to as opportunistic network coding (ONQ, is presented in this paper. In this proposed approach, whether a packet is transmitted with or without network coding is determined by the buffer's queue state at a given node. We shall derive ONC's performance in terms of delay, packet-loss, and power consumption by formulating a Markov Chain and a Hidden Markov Model for the delay and power analysis. More importantly, we will develop an optimal ONC strategy with minimal average delay and zero packet-loss rate. In particular, we will show that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between average delay and power, which characterizes the performance limit of ONC.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289436.pdf","startPage":"4634","endPage":"4639","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Network Coding for Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Wireless networks","Delay","Throughput","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Stochastic processes","Energy consumption","Hidden Markov models","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","hidden Markov models","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic network coding","wireless networks","power efficiency","buffer queue state","packet loss","power consumption","Markov Chain","Hidden Markov model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Network Coding for Wireless Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289436/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875454","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Network Coding for Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S19P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06183S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289437,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We assume that there are real-time (RT) users and best effort (BE) users in the MIMO BC. Numerical results demonstrate that the average delay of RT users can be guaranteed within certain delay thresholds by trading off spatial multiplexing for different user classes. Nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) is more robust to different types of user selection algorithms and shows better performance than linear zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) both in delay and throughput performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trade-Offs of Spatial Gain for QoS-Guaranteed Services in the MIMO Broadcast Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.766","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289437.pdf","startPage":"4640","endPage":"4645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Trade-Offs of Spatial Gain for QoS-Guaranteed Services in the MIMO Broadcast Channels","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289437/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875455","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trade-Offs of Spatial Gain for QoS-Guaranteed Services in the MIMO Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S19P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101935S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289438,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper we propose ways to exploit the fact that, in a typically rich scattering environment, the radio channel response decorrelates quite rapidly in space. Specifically, we describe a physical-layer algorithm that combines channel probing (M complex frequency response samples over a bandwidth W) with hypothesis testing to determine whether current and prior communication attempts are made by the same user (same channel response). In this way, legitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably detected. To evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm, we simulate spatially variable channel responses in real environments using the WiSE ray-tracing tool; and we analyze the ability of a receiver to discriminate between transmitters (users) based on their channel frequency responses in a given office environment. For several rooms in the extremities of the building we considered, we have confirmed the efficacy of our approach under static channel conditions. For example, measuring five frequency response samples over a bandwidth of 100 MHz and using a transmit power of 100 mW, valid users can be verified with 99% confidence while rejecting false users with greater than 95% confidence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprints in the Ether: Using the Physical Layer for Wireless Authentication","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.767","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289438.pdf","startPage":"4646","endPage":"4651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprints in the Ether: Using the Physical Layer for Wireless Authentication","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289438/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875456","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprints in the Ether: Using the Physical Layer for Wireless Authentication","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S19P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068732S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289439,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We consider a time-slotted MIMO broadcast network where the transmitter uses its multiple antennas for spatial multiplexing to communicate simultaneously to a subset of the receivers in each slot. The transmitter sends training symbols at the beginning of a slot so that each receiver can estimate the data rate it could potentially receive from each transmit antenna. For this purpose, we develop a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) of SINR. The receivers report the rate information, which is noisy due to estimation errors, to the transmitter to assist its scheduling decisions. Through numerical examples, we discuss some general issues regarding exploitation of multi-user diversity with imperfect channel state information. For example, the scheduler introduces a bias for positive SINR estimation errors, which is important to take into account when the receivers declare a potential data rate in each slot.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.768","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"4652","endPage":"4657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Diversity with Imperfect Channel Quality Feedback in MIMO Broadcast Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Diversity with Imperfect Channel Quality Feedback in MIMO Broadcast Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289439/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875457","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289439/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Diversity with Imperfect Channel Quality Feedback in MIMO Broadcast Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S19P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054923S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289440,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Moreover, the balanced SIR margin is an indicator for feasibility, so the problem also plays a fundamental role for the characterization of the SIR achievable region and related regions. In this paper, we propose an iterative solution for max-min SIR balancing under the assumption of convex interference functions. It is proven that the proposed iteration always finds the unique global optimum. Similar results in the beamforming context [1] differ in two respects: Firstly, a much more general interference model is used. Secondly, the results a found by using a different analytical approach, which allows to show convergence directly, without the need of compactness arguments. This way, uniqueness of the optimum can be shown. Finally, we show that Yates' fixed-point iteration [2], which is successfully used in a different context, does generally not converge to the max-min optimum, unless an additional scaling is introduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.770","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289441.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.770","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"4664","endPage":"4669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Interference Balancing for General Interference Functions - A Convergence Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Interference Balancing for General Interference Functions - A Convergence Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289441/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875459","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Interference Balancing for General Interference Functions - A Convergence Analysis","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S19P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072095S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289452,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Three levels of BS coordination are considered: full coordination, partial coordination, and no coordination. This paper assumes that the downlink MIMO channel state information (CSI) is sent to the corresponding BS through a feedback link with some delay. In a fully coordinated system, the CSI at each BS needs to be collected at the central coordinator, and this process may result in significant additional delay. In this paper, the achievable throughput of each coordination level is evaluated and compared including the effects of the delay in CSI. A quasi-static fading is considered where the channel is static within one codeword, but it gradually changes over time based on the well-known Jake's model. Also, dirty paper coding (DPC) is applied, which is a transmission method shown to achieve the sum capacity of MIMO broadcast channels (BC). The results show that under certain delay conditions, the partially-coordinated system outperforms the fully-coordinated system. In addition, this paper presents a new partial-coordination method that provides higher throughput than the conventional partial-coordinated system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289452.pdf","startPage":"4728","endPage":"4733","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink MIMO Systems Using Cooperation Among Base Stations in a Slow Fading Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Base stations","Fading","Throughput","Channel state information","State feedback","Added delay","Delay effects","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","fading channels","feedback","MIMO communication","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink MIMO system","quasi-static fading channel","base station","channel state information","Jake model","dirty paper coding","MIMO broadcast channel","feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Downlink MIMO Systems Using Cooperation Among Base Stations in a Slow Fading Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289452/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875470","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink MIMO Systems Using Cooperation Among Base Stations in a Slow Fading Channel","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S21P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056497S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289458,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Previous work in cooperative diversity nearly always assumes cooperation to be a positive. We show that in a large scale multi-hop network, cooperation must only be used selectively. Our figure of merit is achievable data rate between a source and destination at a fixed probability of outage. We show that enforcing multiple hops is detrimental to performance, since each extra hop requires bandwidth expansion. This performance can be significantly improved by incorporating a selective cooperative diversity scheme on a one-hop link. On the other hand, the simulation results show that cooperative diversity does not improve performance over a dynamic routing protocol which searches for the optimal, non-diversity, route. Including the search for cooperative nodes into the dynamic route search, however, does further increase flow rates by decreasing the average number of hops and thus decreasing the required bandwidth expansion. This paper therefore points to the importance of an integrated approach to routing and the physical layer in cooperative networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.787","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289458.pdf","startPage":"4767","endPage":"4772","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperation and Routing in Multi-Hop Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation and Routing in Multi-Hop Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875476","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation and Routing in Multi-Hop Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S22P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082725S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4289460,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Although admission control algorithms that take into account such multi-cell impacts have been studied in the past, little attention has been paid to multi-cell admission and rate control algorithms when traffic is elastic. In this work, we propose a model for multi-cell WCDMA networks to study the impact of admission and rate control algorithms on key performance measures such as the class-wise blocking and dropping probabilities, block error rates and the overall throughput. By means of simulation we compare the performance of multi-cell algorithms with that of a single cell algorithm. For voice traffic, we find that multi-cell algorithms improve the session drop and block error probabilities in both of the examined heterogenous (termed \"Hotspot\" and \"Hotround\") scenarios. When traffic is elastic, the multicell algorithms perform better in the examined homogeneous case.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.792","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289463.pdf","startPage":"4797","endPage":"4804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulative Analysis of a Multi-Cell Admission Control Algorithm in WCDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289463/","displayDocTitle":"Simulative Analysis of a Multi-Cell Admission Control Algorithm in WCDMA Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875481","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289463/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulative Analysis of a Multi-Cell Admission Control Algorithm in WCDMA Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S23P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054819S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289465,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For radio access network (RAN) sharing method each operator has its own core network and only the RAN is shared. Without an efficient RRM, one operator can exhausts the capacity of others. This paper proposes and analyzes an efficient uplink-scheduling scheme in case of RAN sharing method. We refer to this new scheme as multi-operators code division generalized processor sharing scheme (M-CDGPS). It employs both adaptive rate allocation to maximize the resource utilization and GPS techniques to provide fair services for each operator. The performance analysis of this scheme is derived using the GPS performance model. Also, it is compared with static rate M-CDGPS scheme. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed adaptive rate M-CDGPS scheduling scheme improves both system throughput and average delays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Rate Scheduling Scheme for 3G WCDMA Wireless Networks with Multi-Operators","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.794","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289465.pdf","startPage":"4811","endPage":"4816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Rate Scheduling Scheme for 3G WCDMA Wireless Networks with Multi-Operators","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289465/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875483","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Adaptive Rate Scheduling Scheme for 3G WCDMA Wireless Networks with Multi-Operators","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S24P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07047S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289468,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This performs poorly in rapid dispersive fading channel with high mobility. This paper proposes a novel iterative turbo channel estimation to improve the performance of OFDM system over fading channel with both time and frequency selectivity. Unlike the conventional channel estimation techniques only using preamble or pilots, the proposed channel estimation technique makes use of preamble, pilots and soft coded data information in a turbo iterative approach. Mean square error analysis and simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation technique can approach the performance of perfect channel state information (CSI) with fewer pilots insertion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289471.pdf","startPage":"4849","endPage":"4854","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Dispersion","Fading","Time varying systems","Frequency estimation","Iterative methods","Mean square error methods","Error analysis","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","data communication","fading channels","iterative methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative estimation","turbo channel estimation","OFDM system","rapid dispersive fading channel","time selectivity","frequency selectivity","soft coded data information","preamble","pilots","mean square error analysis","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875489","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Turbo Channel Estimation for OFDM System over Rapid Dispersive Fading Channel","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S25P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063308S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289472,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Direct-conversion radio frequency transceivers are appealing because they avoid costly IF analog components. This kind of transceivers imply analog RF I/Q separation. The mismatch between the analog components in the in-phase and quadrature branches introduces an unwanted in-band interference. Unfortunately, OFDM-based systems are very sensitive to I/Q mismatch, mostly when high order modulation schemes are applied. A digital compensation of this unwanted effect is required. In this paper, we developed a method for compensating the transmitter/receiver frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance jointly with the propagation channel in the frequency domain. Based on a low complexity ML channel estimator, a pilot design criterion is derived for channel and IQ imbalance coefficients estimation. An advanced equalizer is proposed which compensates for the frequency-dependent IQ imbalance. Both steps, estimation and compensation, are low cost in terms of implementation complexity. The proposed algorithm enables the system to achieve high SNRs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot design for Joint Channel and Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.802","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289473.pdf","startPage":"4861","endPage":"4866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pilot design for Joint Channel and Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289473/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875491","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot design for Joint Channel and Frequency-Dependent Transmit/Receive IQ Imbalance Estimation and Compensation in OFDM-Based Transceivers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S25P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072142S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289474,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The receiver has to detect each signal from the multiplexed signal. MMSE-SIC combines MMSE filtering and soft interference cancellation (SIC) with soft replicas and can achieve good bit error rate (BER) performance. If an irregular LDPC code or a turbo code is used, the reliability and BER of the information bits output by the decoder are likely to be higher and better than the parity bits. In MMSE-SIC, bits with poor reliability lower the accuracy of soft replica estimation. When the soft replica is inaccurate, the gain obtained by SIC is small. For M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), larger constellations such as 8PSK and 16QAM transfer more bits per symbol, and the number of bits per symbol impacts the accuracy of SIC. Unfortunately, increasing the number of bits per symbol is likely to lower the accuracy of soft replica estimation. In this paper, we evaluate three types of the mapping scheme for MMSE-SIC with either LDPC codes or turbo codes with the goal of effectively increasing the SIC gain. The first scheme is the information bit or the parity bit reliable mapping. In this scheme, either information bits or parity bits are assigned to strongly protected bits. The second scheme is the weight based mapping. When the number of information bits is larger than that of strongly protected bits, not all the information bits are assigned to strongly protected bits. In the weight based mapping, information bits are assigned to strongly protected bits with the increasing or decreasing orders of that weight. The last one is the random mapping. Computer simulations show that in MMSE-SIC with irregular LDPC codes or turbo codes, information reliable and high weight reliable mapping offer the highest SIC gain. We also show that in MMSE-SIC with the regular LDPC code, the gains offered by the mapping schemes are very small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289477/","accessionNumber":"9875495","displayDocTitle":"Mapping for Iterative MMSE-SIC with Belief Propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping for Iterative MMSE-SIC with Belief Propagation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S26P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041067S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4289481,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A novel low-complexity zero-forcing dirty-paper-coding (DPC) scheme, named as Successive ZF-DPC, and a multiuser scheduling algorithm are proposed to asymptotically approach the sum capacity of MIMO GBC. After the ordered subset of active users determined by the scheduling algorithm, the successive ZF-DPC successively puts the precoding matrix of each user in the null space of the composite matrix stacked by channel matrices of preceding users in the subset such that each user is not subject to the interference caused by the following users in the subset. Then, DPC can be used to eliminate the interference caused by the preceding users, which ultimately nullifies the mutual interference among users. Our analysis and simulations show that the Successive ZF-DPC is asymptotically sum-rate optimal in both spatially uncorrelated and correlated channels even if each user has multiple antennas. Furthermore, it is shown that the multiuser scheduling algorithm can make efficient use of the multiuser diversity to increase the achievable maximal sum rate and accelerate the approach to the sum capacity of the MIMO GBC.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.823","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289494.pdf","startPage":"4985","endPage":"4990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Asymptotically Sum-Rate Optimal Precoding Scheme for MIMO Gaussian Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289494/","displayDocTitle":"An Asymptotically Sum-Rate Optimal Precoding Scheme for MIMO Gaussian Broadcast Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875512","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289494/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Asymptotically Sum-Rate Optimal Precoding Scheme for MIMO Gaussian Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S29P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064961S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289495,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The capacity of MIMO system over Weibull fading channels has not been considered in the literature before because of the complexity in obtaining closed form expressions for either the probability of outage capacity or the average capacity. In this paper, finite mixture (FM) with expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to derive simple approximate expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the capacity distribution over identically independent distributed (iid) Weibull fading channels. This approximation converts the complicated capacity distribution to a simple weighted sum of univariate normal distributions with appropriate weighting coefficients, means, and variances for a predefined system model and channel statistics. The resultant approximation simplifies the mathematical analysis of the average capacity and the outage capacity in terms of well known Q-functions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289497.pdf","startPage":"5003","endPage":"5008","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO System Over Identically Independent Distributed Weibull Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Weibull fading channels","Capacity planning","Gaussian distribution","Wireless communication","Probability density function","Statistical distributions","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","mathematical analysis","MIMO communication","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Weibull fading channels","multiple input multiple output","MIMO system","wireless channels","wireless fading channels","finite mixture algorithm","expectation-maximization algorithm","probability density function","identically independent distributed channels","channel statistics","mathematical analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO System Over Identically Independent Distributed Weibull Fading Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875515","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Analysis of MIMO System Over Identically Independent Distributed Weibull Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S29P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063915S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289498,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, a differential scheme based on a spatial multiplexing approach such as the Bell-Labs layered space time (BLAST) wireless architecture would be likely to provide a much greater capacity. To this end, in this paper, we derive a simple differential modulation scheme based on BLAST for any number of transmit antennas and receive antennas. A special symbol mapping method is developed to avoid amplitude variation of the transmitted signals, which can also improve the system performance. This differential scheme can significantly reduce the system complexity, since it avoids the need for channel estimation. Moreover, an improved sub-optimal detection algorithm based on a Gaussian approximation is applied to greatly reduce computational complexity at the receiver, otherwise prohibitive, with only very slight performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.841","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"5093","endPage":"5097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289512.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","MIMO","Block codes","Robustness","Transmitting antennas","Signal mapping","System performance","Channel estimation","Detection algorithms","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","block codes","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","receivers","space-time codes","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bell-Labs layered space time architectures","differential MIMO","space-time block codes","maximum transmit diversity","quasiorthogonal code structures","spatial multiplexing","BLAST wireless architecture","transmit antennas","receive antennas","symbol mapping","channel estimation","suboptimal detection algorithm","Gaussian approximation","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Differential Bell-Labs Layered Space Time Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289512/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289512/","accessionNumber":"9875530","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Bell-Labs Layered Space Time Architectures","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S32P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049857S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289513,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In MIMO systems, it has been reported that the scheme that weights transmitted signals based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion at the transmitter using feedback channel state information (CSI) achieves good performance (denoted hereafter as MMSE precoding). A throughput maximization transmission control scheme (TMTC) that selects the transmission mode (modulation schemes and code rates) based on CSI has been proposed. We expect that its throughput performance can be improved by addition of MMSE precoding. However, throughput performance is degraded in the presence of feedback delay. In this paper, we propose TMTC with MMSE precoding; it reduces the throughput performance degradation by using channel prediction and the receive weights robust against feedback delay. The proposed scheme selects a transmission mode (the number of substreams, modulation schemes, and code rates) and configures the precoder to achieve maximum throughput based on the SINR given by channel prediction. Simulation results show that even when feedback delay exists, the proposed scheme attains high throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289513.pdf","startPage":"5098","endPage":"5102","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Maximization Transmission Control Scheme Using Precoding for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Control systems","MIMO","Feedback","Delay","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Degradation","Data communication","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission control scheme","precoding","MIMO systems","multiple input multiple output systems","minimum mean square error criterion","MMSE","feedback channel state information","CSI","throughput maximization transmission control scheme","TMTC","channel prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Maximization Transmission Control Scheme Using Precoding for MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875531","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Maximization Transmission Control Scheme Using Precoding for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S32P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053076S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289515,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It differentiates from conventional timing recovery algorithms for OFDM systems in two aspects. Firstly a new timing-clock-offset (TO) estimator is proposed, which utilizes the post MIMO detection SNRs to weight and combine TO estimates in frequency and spatial domains. This TO estimator efficiently handles the MIMO fading and the colored noise caused by MIMO detection to improve the estimation accuracy. Secondly, a novel third-order PLL structure is developed and its stochastic difference equation (SDE) that represents the dynamic behavior of the tracking loop is derived and used to evaluate the loop performance. The proposed PLL has an good loop noise performance for fast acquisition and stable tracking.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a potential modulation technique for CR networks' air interface. In this paper, we study and explore optimal power loading algorithm for an OFDM-based CR system and the rate in each subcarrier is adjusted according to the power. As such the downlink capacity of the CR user is maximized while the interference introduced to the primary user remains within a tolerable range. We also propose two suboptimal loading algorithms that have less complexity. The performance of optimal and suboptimal schemes are compared with the performance of classical power loading algorithms that are used for conventional OFDM-based systems e.g., water-filling and uniform power but variable rate loading schemes. Presented numerical results show that for a given interference threshold the proposed optimal scheme allows the CR users to transmit more power in order to achieve higher transmission rate than the classical loading algorithms. These results also show that the proposed suboptimal schemes offer a performance close to the optimal scheme. Finally, we study the effect of subcarrier nulling mechanism on the performance of different algorithms under consideration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289520.pdf","startPage":"5137","endPage":"5142","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Power Loading for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","OFDM modulation","Downlink","FCC","Communications Society","Spectral analysis","Fading","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power loading","OFDM","cognitive radio systems","spectrum utilization","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","downlink capacity","interference threshold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Power Loading for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289520/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875538","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Power Loading for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S33P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045621S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289521,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This kind of network offers different challenges when compared to the fixed ones, as power consumption becomes a major concern. In this standard, a strict organization of the downlink bursts is not guaranteed in the OFDMA frame and this may lead to extra power consumption for the receiver, decreasing the device's lifetime. In the present paper, we introduce an optimization algorithm capable of reducing the activity of each receiver in the system for decoding its addressed bursts, thanks to a better time-frequency organization of the bursts. We first work on fitting bursts within the smallest frame, and show that the minimal number of OFDM symbols is enough in 70 to 80% of the cases, while one extra is needed otherwise. Using a binary tree implementation of an exhaustive burst placement search, we also show that we can gain 20 to 30% in duty-cycling of the receivers by selecting the best configuration, hence gaining the corresponding energy. This holds for receivers decoding either their bursts only or all the bursts from the beginning of the frame up to their own bursts before sleeping, depending on the scenario. The full search is sustainable for up to 8 user bursts per frame.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289522.pdf","startPage":"5149","endPage":"5154","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiMAX Downlink OFDMA Burst Placement for Optimized Receiver Duty-Cycling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Downlink","Wireless LAN","OFDM","Energy consumption","Decoding","Physical layer","Portable media players","Frequency conversion","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","receivers","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiMAX downlink","OFDMA burst placement","optimized receiver duty-cycling","mobile wireless broadband access networks","IEEE 802.16e standard","downlink bursts","power consumption","optimization algorithm","time-frequency organization","OFDM symbols","binary tree","receivers decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"WiMAX Downlink OFDMA Burst Placement for Optimized Receiver Duty-Cycling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875540","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiMAX Downlink OFDMA Burst Placement for Optimized Receiver Duty-Cycling","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S33P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046815S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289523,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two major challenges that are faced by IEEE 802.22 are (i) the issue of self co-existence and (ii) the hidden incumbent problem. In this paper, we discuss these two challenges and provide enhancements to the existing IEEE 802.22 air-interface. We use a graph theoretic technique and propose utility graph coloring for allocating spectrum to different IEEE 802.22 base stations so that they can co-exist. The allocation is done such that objectives such as throughput maximization, proportional fairness, and complete fairness are met. We also propose the use of dynamic multiple broadcast messages that resolves the contention among various consumer premise equipments and alleviates the hidden incumbent problem. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed techniques increase the system spectrum utilization and reduce connection set-up delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289523/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875541","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289523/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enhancements to Cognitive Radio Based IEEE 802.22 Air-Interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancements to Cognitive Radio Based IEEE 802.22 Air-Interface","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S34P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046728S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289524,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The percentage of spectrum utilized by one SP depends on how many users it is serving and how much spectrum each user application demands. We assume that an user can obtain service from all the SPs. The quality of service depends on system parameters such as number of users and SPs, the channel conditions between the users and SPs and the total power available at each user. We adopt an user utility maximization framework to analyze this system. Given the user utility functions, and the above mentioned system parameters we derive optimal values of spectrum that the users should obtain from the SPs. We also introduce the notion of spectrum price and use it to demonstrate several key results about spectrum allocation. The spectrum price proves to be the regulatory mechanism that brings about coordination amongst the SPs with minimal control messaging. Our approach thus strikes a balance between a centralized network and a fully uncoordinated open access network.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.854","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289525.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.854","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"5166","endPage":"5171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Between Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Between Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289525/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875543","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Between Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S34P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079615S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289527,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The objective is to maximize the downlink throughput of the cognitive network without affecting the performance of primary users. For this, we propose a mixed distributed/centralized control algorithm that requires minimal interaction between cognitive and primary devices. First, a distributed power updating process is employed at the cognitive and primary nodes to maximize the coverage of the cognitive network while always maintaining the constrained signal to interference plus noise ratios (SINR) of primary transmissions. After that, centralized channel assignment is carried out within the cognitive network to maximize its downlink throughput.

If a digital approach is taken to provide the necessary radio flexibility to exploit this sparsity, there is a challenging dynamic range requirement in the analog to digital conversion, since there are large interfering signals which are effectively in-band and can not be removed by fixed RF pre-filtering. Using a mixed analog digital system architecture which uses multiple low accuracy ADCs with digital adaptive filters, it is possible to increase the effective dynamic range of the input by subtracting off the unwanted signals in the time domain.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.857","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289528.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.857","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"5183","endPage":"5188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addressing the Dynamic Range Problem in Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Addressing the Dynamic Range Problem in Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289528/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289528/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875546","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing the Dynamic Range Problem in Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S34P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047473S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289530,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Our study shows that, for any given linear MUD scheme, there exists a counterpart linear MUT scheme, which can be readily designed from the original linear MUD. Based on our observations, a range of MUT algorithms are derived in correspondence with the well-known linear processing schemes in the fields of MUD and array processing, including minimum mean-square error (MMSE), minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR), respectively. Furthermore, the physical principles behind the considered MUT schemes are explained with the aid of the concepts built in this contribution. In order to gain insight into the effect of noise power on the achievable performance of a MUT scheme, a noise-suppression factor is introduced to those MUT schemes, such as MMSE, requiring the knowledge of noise variance. Our study shows that the achievable performance of the MUT is generally loosely depended on the noise-suppression factor. This finding may result in extremely low-complexity wireless transceivers in time- division duplex (TDD) cellular systems, where the uplink MUD and downlink MUT can be implemented based on one adaptive signal processing scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Linear Multiuser Transmitters from Linear Multiuser Receivers","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.870","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289541.pdf","startPage":"5258","endPage":"5263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design Linear Multiuser Transmitters from Linear Multiuser Receivers","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289541/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875559","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Linear Multiuser Transmitters from Linear Multiuser Receivers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S35P13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048447S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289545,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Game theory provides a framework for analyzing spectrum access, a problem that involves complex distributed decisions by independent spectrum users. We develop a cooperative game theory model to analyze a scenario where nodes in a multi-hop wireless network need to agree on a fair allocation of spectrum. We show that in high interference environments, the utility space of the game is non-convex, which may make some optimal allocations unachievable with pure strategies. However, we show that as the number of channels available increases, the utility space becomes close to convex and thus optimal allocations become achievable with pure strategies. We propose the use of the Nash Bargaining Solution and show that it achieves a good compromise between fairness and efficiency, using a small number of channels. Finally, we propose a distributed algorithm for spectrum sharing and show that it achieves allocations reasonably close to the Nash Bargaining Solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289545/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875563","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289545/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Game Theory for Distributed Spectrum Sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Game Theory for Distributed Spectrum Sharing","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S35P17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090383S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289546,"authors":[{"name":"S.-R.

Motivated by the log-likelihood ratio based ordering scheme introduced in [1], a new ordering method is presented which can further enhance the V-BLAST performance. The proposed ordering based on the new metric minimizes the SER by exploiting the instantaneous noise and considering its correlation at the linear filter output. A simpler suboptimal ordering metric is also proposed which requires much less computational complexity than that of the optimal ordering metric. We further show that there exists a simplified version of the suboptimal ordering metric for BPSK and 4QAM which achieves a significant performance gain over the conventional ordering scheme with no additional complexity. Simulation results show that the optimal ordering scheme achieves a performance gain of 13 dB at a SER of 10 over conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ordering schemes with four transmit and four receive antennas. The performance of the suboptimal ordering scheme is shown to be less than 2 dB away from that of the optimal ordering.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289546.pdf","startPage":"5288","endPage":"5293","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.875","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.875","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289546","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear filters","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity","Performance gain","Error analysis","Binary phase shift keying","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Samarium","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","correlation methods","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal detection ordering","V-BLAST","symbol error rate","vertical Bell-lab layered space-time systems","log-likelihood ratio","correlation","computational complexity","BPSK","4QAM","signal-to-noise ratio ordering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289546/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Detection Ordering for V-BLAST","accessionNumber":"9875564","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289546/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Detection Ordering for V-BLAST","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S35P18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072718S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289547,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We define reliability as the reciprocal of the probable number of transmission attempts required to ship each unit of application data successfully under a given demand. The demand represents the flow rate (per unit of time) at which an application needs to be served. We provide analytical methods of reliability evaluation for two classes of DSA network service. 1. A network servicing a single source-destination pair and 2. A network servicing a broadcasting or multicasting application where common data has to be disseminated to all or a subset of nodes in the network. All the nodes involved in data communication are secondary nodes, which access the channels reserved for primary users, in an unlicensed manner. Our methods take into account the channel capacities of the links and provide an useful and an important metric for the effectiveness of a dynamic spectrum access network for a given demand. These methods can also be used to find robust routing paths in such networks. The approach we use is based on concepts in mathematical theory of reliability and theory of network flows. Our methodologies are scalable, simple to implement and can be extended to all other types of communication networks and network applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address reliability issues in DSA networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.876","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289547.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.876","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"5294","endPage":"5299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reliability of Multi-Hop Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks Supporting QoS Driven Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Reliability of Multi-Hop Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks Supporting QoS Driven Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289547/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875565","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Reliability of Multi-Hop Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks Supporting QoS Driven Applications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S35P19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10141S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289549,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The motivation for the proposed filters arises from the possibility of avoiding the generation of certain interference and noise terms in a given stage that would have been present in a conventional LPIC (CLPIC). In the proposed filters, we achieve such avoidance of the generation of interference and noise terms in a given stage by simply making the diagonal elements of a certain matrix in that stage equal to zero. Hence, the proposed filters do not require additional complexity compared to the CLPIC, and they can allow achieving a certain error performance using fewer LPIC stages.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Nonlinear filters","Detectors","Noise generators","Multiaccess communication","Decorrelation","Multiple access interference","Matched filters","Mean square error methods","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","filtering theory","interference suppression","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved linear interference canceller","parallel interference cancellers","linear matrix filter","improved bit error performance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.880","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289551.pdf","startPage":"5318","endPage":"5323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Linear Parallel Interference Cancellers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Linear Parallel Interference Cancellers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289551/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289551/","accessionNumber":"9875569","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Linear Parallel Interference Cancellers","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S35P23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047956S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289556,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We derive the optimal dirty-paper coding (DPC) scheme and its corresponding achievable rates with the assumption of Gaussian inputs. Our results, for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, provide intuitive insights on the impact of the channel estimate and the channel characteristics (e.g. SNR, fading process, channel training) on the achievable rates. These are useful in practical scenarios of multiuser wireless communications (e.g. Broadcast Channels) and information embedding applications (e.g. robust watermarking). We also studied optimal training design adapted to each application. We provide numerical results for a single-user fading Costa's channel with maximum-likehood (ML) channel estimation.

Inspired by previous work presented in the literature, a novel DSFM scheme is devised, which makes use of spatial and/or spectral (multipath) diversity and is particularly suited for MIMO-OFDM and power-efficient, low-delay MSDD. Furthermore, the application of a two-dimensional (2D) observation window to MSDD (2D-MSDD) in order to exploit channel correlations in both time and frequency direction, is investigated and tree-search decoding is applied to solve the detection problem efficiently. An analytical approximation of the symbol-error rate of 2D-MSDD for MIMO-OFDM under spatially correlated fading is derived, which enables quick and accurate performance evaluations. Numerical and simulation results corroborate the efficacy of our approach and show that power efficiency close to that of coherent detection with perfect CSI is feasible in all standard fading scenarios at reasonable decoder complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289567.pdf","startPage":"5412","endPage":"5418","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Space-Frequency Modulation and 2D-Detection for MIMO-OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","OFDM modulation","Channel state information","Bandwidth","MIMO","Communications Society","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","differential detection","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","space division multiplexing","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential space-frequency modulation","MIMO-OFDM 2D-detection","differential space-frequency frequency division multiplexing","multiple-symbol differential detection","channel state information","spectral multipath diversity","two-dimensional observation window","spatially correlated fading channel","tree-search decoding","symbol-error rate approximation","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Differential Space-Frequency Modulation and 2D-Detection for MIMO-OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289567/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875585","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Space-Frequency Modulation and 2D-Detection for MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S38P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076062S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289568,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This paper considers exploiting multi-user diversity in a unique and practical setting that includes - significant transmit correlation, a broadband channel using OFDM, and imperfect CSI at the transmitter derived from channel reciprocity techniques. These imply a higher correlation amongst user channels and an increase in the volume of CSI per user.

One of the major impairments is the mismatching errors between the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches in the up and down-conversions. The I/Q mismatching errors can include phase and amplitude mismatching errors. These mismatching errors make the signal constellation expand and rotate, which severely degrades the performance of OFDM systems. In this paper, a closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) of the OFDM system in I/Q mismatching error environments is derived as a function of phase and amplitude mismatching error parameters. This enables a convenient and useful evaluation of the performance of OFDM communication systems with I/Q mismatching errors. The derived analytical expression is validated by the fact that computer simulation results closely match with the analytical derivation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.898","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289569.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"5423","endPage":"5427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of the I/Q Mismatching Errors on the BER Performance of OFDM Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of the I/Q Mismatching Errors on the BER Performance of OFDM Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289569/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875587","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289569/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of the I/Q Mismatching Errors on the BER Performance of OFDM Communication Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S38P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127158S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289570,"authors":[{"name":"C.-D.

In this paper we propose a simple and effective multichannel multiple access technique for OSA networks. In our design users of an OSA network must contact the OSA Base Station to gain access to the radio resources. In an OSA environment each of the channels can be arbitrarily occupied by the Primary Users (PUs) of the specific band. Thus the OSA nodes should cause least interference to the PUs while exploiting the voids in the PU usage. We analyze the OSA network where many OSA nodes would be competing amongst themselves and with the PU, using fast retrials. We also propose mechanisms to minimize the probability of collisions and interference caused to the PUs, while maximizing the throughput of the OSA network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289572.pdf","startPage":"5439","endPage":"5444","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Multichannel OFDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Access protocols","Media Access Protocol","Base stations","Peer to peer computing","Interference","Wireless communication","Time division multiple access","Communications Society","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","probability","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic spectrum multichannel OFDMA","opportunistic spectrum access","multichannel multiple access technique","OSA networks","OSA base station","radio resources","probability","PU channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Multichannel OFDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875590","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Multichannel OFDMA","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S38P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049702S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289574,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

From analyzing the union bound on the symbol error probability, we show that the diversity order of the deterministic pruning is only one by fixing the pruning probability. By choosing different pruning probability distribution functions, the statistical pruning can achieve arbitrary diversity orders and SNR gains.

For time division duplex TDD systems, the transmitter estimates the CSI while receiving data at current time slot and then uses the CSI to transmit at the next time slot. When the wireless channel is time- varying, the CSI for transmission is imperfect due to the time delay between the estimation of the channel and the transmission of the data and severely degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a linear method to suppress the interferences among users and data streams caused by imperfect CSI at transmitter. The transmitter first sends pilot signals through a linear spatial preceding matrix so as to make possible that the receiver can estimate CSI of other users, and then the receiver exploits a linear prefllter to suppress the interference. The numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve obvious performance enhancement in comparison to the scheme assuming perfect CSI at the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.914","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"5514","endPage":"5518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink Transmission Over Time-Varying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink Transmission Over Time-Varying Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289585/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875603","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289585/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink Transmission Over Time-Varying Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S40P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050137S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289586,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The phenomenon of inter-cell interference fluctuation in future cellular systems is explained and its negative effect on traditional resource allocation methods is analyzed. The proposed algorithm includes two independent sub-algorithms: 1) user grouping based resource allocation scheme, in which radio resource is limited to be reallocated within a group of users generating close inter-cell interference; 2) power compensation based resource allocation scheme, in which inter-cell interference fluctuation is compensated by adjusting transmitting power of UE. And performance evaluation results show that our algorithms smooth the inter-cell interference successfully and can improve system spectrum efficiency by 10-15% compared with existing traditional adaptive resource allocation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Adaptive Resource Allocation Mitigating Inter-Cell Interference Fluctuation for Future Cellular Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.915","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289586.pdf","startPage":"5519","endPage":"5524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Adaptive Resource Allocation Mitigating Inter-Cell Interference Fluctuation for Future Cellular Systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289586/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875604","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Adaptive Resource Allocation Mitigating Inter-Cell Interference Fluctuation for Future Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S40P08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110703S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289591,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We analyze the real-time characteristics of a cdma2000 1xEV-DO broadcast and multicast service (BCMCS) system, and propose a system architecture to provide seamless multimedia services. We found that jitter in the processing time of the Reed-Solomon decoder can lead to a discontinuity in multimedia streaming, and we therefore estimated the Reed-Solomon decoding time on a common mobile platform for a given bit error-rate or fading margin in the channel. Next we evaluated the jitter bound and the best cache size for real-time applications in BCMCS. This analysis allows us to suggest a system architecture based on the jitter-EDD model to ensure the continuity of real-time services for multimedia applications over a 3G cellular broadcast network, and to provide a better quality of service.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seamless Multimedia Broadcasting Over cdma2000 BCMCS Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.933","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289604.pdf","startPage":"5628","endPage":"5635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Seamless Multimedia Broadcasting Over cdma2000 BCMCS Networks","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289604/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seamless Multimedia Broadcasting Over cdma2000 BCMCS Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S40P26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110051S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289611,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The integration and interoperability of this multitude of available networks will lead to the emergence of the fourth generation (4G) of wireless technologies. 4G wireless technologies have the potential to provide these features and many more, which at the end will change the way we use mobile devices and provide a wide variety of new applications. However, such technology does not come without its challenges. One of these challenges is the user's ability to control and manage handoffs across heterogeneous wireless networks. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed method is capable of distinguishing the best existing wireless network that matches predefined user preferences set on a mobile device when performing a vertical handoff. The overall performance of the proposed method shows 87.0 % success rate in finding the best available wireless network. To test for the robustness and effectiveness of the neural network algorithm, some of the features were removed from the training set and results showed a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Hence, managing vertical handoffs through user preferences can be significantly affected with the selection of features used to provide the closest match of the available wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.940","startPage":"5671","endPage":"5676","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Middleware Vertical Handoff Manager: A Neural Network-Based Solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Neural networks","Wireless networks","Quality of service","Roaming","Communications Society","Computer network management","Quality management","Computer networks","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","middleware","mobile radio","neural nets","quality of service","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware vertical handoff manager","quality of service","4G wireless network","mobile device","artificial neural network","user preference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Middleware Vertical Handoff Manager: A Neural Network-Based Solution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875628","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Middleware Vertical Handoff Manager: A Neural Network-Based Solution","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S41P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065577S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4289613,"authors":[{"name":"C.-F.

The dynamic priority adjustment scheme gives high priority to urgent users and dynamically adjust the value frame by frame based on users' QoS requirement and queue occupancy. The PBG algorithm allocates the radio resource iteratively according to a cost value to maximize the system throughput while allocating enough resource to high-priority users.

By this model, the BER of two of the most popular wireless broadcasting standards, digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T), has been assessed in Rayleigh and Rice channels. Simulation results show that the delay spread of the channel heavily affects the performance of DVB-T, while DAB is less sensitive to the frequency-selectivity of the channel.

However, there remain a number of research challenges to be tackled. One of the most important challenges is the design of a judicious packet scheduler so as to make efficient use of the spectrum bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new QoS-aware proportional fairness (QPF) packet scheduling policy for the downlink of multiuser OFDM systems to allocate radio resource among users. Our proposed algorithm is based on a cross layer design in that the scheduler is aware of both channel and queue state information to achieve proportional fairness while improving each user's QoS performance.

In different types of wireless networks, these two basic frequency planning methods are implemented under variable system deployment strategies. With respect to the IEEE 802.16 OFDMA network, interference avoidance is usually carried out by carefully designing the frequency reuse patterns, while interference averaging is implemented by distributed subcarrier permutation, which can be further divided into multiple operation modes. In this paper, based on the system level simulation of the average signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the 802.16 system, the performance metrics of system throughput and outage probability are estimated. According to the predetermined evaluation criterions, the system performances under variable combination patterns of frequency reuse and subcarrier permutation are evaluated. Finally, the optimal frequency planning strategies, in terms of the frequency reuse pattern and the subcarrier permutation mode, is obtained, which can serve as a reference in practical network deployments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289619.pdf","startPage":"5720","endPage":"5725","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System Under Different Frequency Reuse and Subcarrier Permutation Patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Wireless cellular systems","Interchannel interference","Wireless networks","Strategic planning","Frequency conversion","Signal to noise ratio","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Radio spectrum management","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","probability","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.16 OFDMA system","frequency reuse pattern","subcarrier permutation pattern","interference-limited wireless cellular system","interference avoidance","interference averaging","co-channel interference","frequency planning method","system level simulation","probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System Under Different Frequency Reuse and Subcarrier Permutation Patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875636","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System Under Different Frequency Reuse and Subcarrier Permutation Patterns","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S43P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069813S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289620,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A typical example is the weighted sum rate maximization under a sum power constraint and possibly additional rate requirements. A major challenge is to incorporate the fact that in real systems the number of modulation depths and coding schemes is limited due to technical conditions. Thus, the scheduling problem results in a discrete optimization problem with non-differentiable non-convex objective. In this paper a new approach is presented that can deal with this kind of constraints in a general way. By transforming the discrete problem in a suitable weight matching problem an efficient algorithm which is easy to implement is devised. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated by simulations with parameters obtained from the recently proposed OFDM-HSDPA concept [1].","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.949","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289620.pdf","startPage":"5726","endPage":"5731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility Maximization for OFDMA Systems Over Discrete Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289620/","displayDocTitle":"Utility Maximization for OFDMA Systems Over Discrete Sets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289620/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility Maximization for OFDMA Systems Over Discrete Sets","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S43P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289621,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Here we analytically assess the error probability by employing a collision model to describe the non-stationarity of the out-of-cell interference due to random subcarriers permutation as prescribed by PUSC mode. The collision model permits an accurate analysis both of uncoded and coded transmissions.

In this way, a higher number of sub-carriers with low per-carrier cshould be assigned to users at cell border. This strategy has already proved its efficiency in the single-cell scenario, while no study has been provided in the multi-cell scenario with reuse factor equal to one, i.e., in presence of severe interference conditions. In this paper we propose an optimum centralized radio resource allocator for the multi-cell scenario of an OFDMA cellular system which allows to highly outperform iterative decentralized allocation strategies based on local optimization criteria. The proposed scheme is characterized by huge implementation complexity, and, hence, it can be hardly implemented in the real world. However, it can help the system designer in catching the essence of interference limitations in OFDMA cellular systems, thus allowing the elaboration of efficient heuristic decentralized approaches. As an example, we prove that the sub-carrier transmission format adaptation is not useful in a multi-cell scenario. This is because users at cell border tends to consume the most of the resources (i.e., they are assigned the most of sub-carriers), thus producing interference for the neighbor cells over a large set of sub-carriers. Hence, since in this case neighbor cells are forced to use those (few) sub-carriers which experiment low interference, the diversity gain tends to be missed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized Radio Resource Allocation for OFDMA Cellular Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.951","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289622.pdf","startPage":"5738","endPage":"5743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Centralized Radio Resource Allocation for OFDMA Cellular Systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289622/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875639","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized Radio Resource Allocation for OFDMA Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S43P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063147S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289623,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The key challenge is that the cyclic prefix of the interference signal does not line up with that of the intended signal due to asynchronous transmission in WLAN. Therefore, the orthogonality among the different tones of the interference signal is destroyed and conventional frequency domain minimum mean square error (MMSE) cancelation techniques that measure the interference channel response for each tone can not work effectively. To suppress the asynchronous interference, we design an efficient estimator to measure the interference spatial covariance matrix using Cholesky decomposition and low-pass smoothing. Both a MMSE and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver are derived based on the estimated interference statistics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289623.pdf","startPage":"5744","endPage":"5750","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Co-channel Interference Suppression in MIMO OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","MIMO","OFDM","Interference suppression","Radiofrequency interference","Wireless LAN","Frequency domain analysis","Mean square error methods","Interference cancellation","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","covariance matrices","interference suppression","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous cochannel interference suppression","MIMO OFDM Systems","CCI","dominant limiting factor","high-density WLAN","interference signal","channel response","spatial covariance matrix","Cholesky decomposition","low-pass smoothing","maximum a posteriori receiver","MAP receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Co-channel Interference Suppression in MIMO OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289623/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875640","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Co-channel Interference Suppression in MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S43P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057382S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289627,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While a range of analog and digital UWB architectures exist, the mostly-digital approach without analog down-conversion enables better technology scaling and signal processing flexibility. Furthermore, recently proposed sub-sampling schemes and advances in high-speed ADC circuit design are helping to make this approach more feasible at low power. However, architectures that directly sample the received signal are more vulnerable to sampling jitter. Currently, there does not exist a model describing the impact of sampling jitter making it difficult to determine appropriate tolerances or to establish the feasibility of digital architectures. To address this problem, we have developed a model of sampling jitter and derived a generic bit error rate expressions for a digital UWB modem with sampling jitter, additive noise, and imperfect channel estimation in a generic multipath environment. We then use this model to investigate the performance of sub-sampled digital UWB in a body area network. This paper explains this analytical model and compares it with simulations results for communication around the body.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.956","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289627.pdf","startPage":"5769","endPage":"5774","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Sampling Jitter on Mostly-Digital Architectures for UWB Bio-Medical Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Sampling Jitter on Mostly-Digital Architectures for UWB Bio-Medical Applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875644","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289627/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Sampling Jitter on Mostly-Digital Architectures for UWB Bio-Medical Applications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S44P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065437S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4289633,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Both produce the same degradation in terms of quality of service and have the same power. The theoretical expression is given for the time delay between paths inferior to the chip period. This paper shows the impact of the pulse shaping filter on the orthogonality factor. If the pulse shaping is not taken into account, in some cases the orthogonality factor will be overvalued by 3 dB. A right choice of the pulse shaping filter form can reduce the orthogonality factor. Another important conclusion is that the orthogonality factor can perfectly model the raw performance if the phase reference quality is good. However in the case of coded performance, the precision of the model is lesser. The different statistics of the interferences degrade the precision of the model for coded performance. Finally, the paper shows that the behaviour at the cell border with a dedicated phase reference is by far the most favourable to macrodiversity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.962","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289633.pdf","startPage":"5807","endPage":"5812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Expression of Rake Receiver Performance in DS-CDMA Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289633/","displayDocTitle":"A General Expression of Rake Receiver Performance in DS-CDMA Downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875650","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289633/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Expression of Rake Receiver Performance in DS-CDMA Downlink","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071017S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289634,"authors":[{"name":"L.-P.

Instead of being restricted by interference, the capacity of CC/DS-CDMA, however, is constrained by the number of code flocks due to the small family size of current CC codes. In this article, an channel-dependent code family extension (COFE) scheme is proposed to increase the system capacity. The performance of the COFE scheme is investigated through extensive computer simulations. It is concluded that the COFE scheme not only tends to hold the interference-free property of CC/DS-CDMA, but also offers significant spectrum efficiency and system capability in terms of supporting applications with diverse QoS requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.963","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"5813","endPage":"5818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design Based Code Family Extension for CC/DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design Based Code Family Extension for CC/DS-CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289634/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875651","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289634/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design Based Code Family Extension for CC/DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05442S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289636,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The mechanism consists of allocating an average number of time- slots to the active user population according to a prescribed quality of service requirement. It is dubbed virtual because it does not rely on user scheduling over different time-slots, but instead it is controlled by adjusting the probability of false alarm of each user. The allocation mechanism improves the throughput of conventional NDMA protocols at the expense of both an access delay degradation and an increased system complexity. The system requires to recover the signals from a mixing system with more outputs (the collected network transmissions) than inputs (the collided packets). By setting the average allocated time-slots to remain constant over different traffic loads, both the optimum transmission probabilities and the stability region of the protocol are approximated by relevant closed-form expressions. Also, the proposed analytical formulation extends the expressions of conventional NDMA systems to the asymmetrical user case (i.e. users with different data rates and detection statistics). Finally, it is shown that under extreme traffic loads, multiuser detection conditions and quality of service requirements, the proposed system degrades into the equivalent of the traditional networking protocols TDMA (time division multiple access) and Slotted- ALOHA (S-ALOHA).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Wireless networks","Access protocols","Multiuser detection","Degradation","Telecommunication traffic","Time division multiple access","Resource management","Wireless application protocol","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiuser detection","quality of service","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication traffic","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","wireless network diversity multiple access protocols","virtual time-slot allocation","resource allocation mechanism","multiuser detection","network traffic load","optimum transmission probability","time division multiple access","TDMA","Slotted-ALOHA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.968","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289639.pdf","startPage":"5843","endPage":"5848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of Service in Wireless Network Diversity Multiple Access Protocols Based on a Virtual Time-Slot Allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Service in Wireless Network Diversity Multiple Access Protocols Based on a Virtual Time-Slot Allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289639/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289639/","accessionNumber":"9875656","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Service in Wireless Network Diversity Multiple Access Protocols Based on a Virtual Time-Slot Allocation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075174S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4289641,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The results revealed that the proposed algorithm demonstrates a stable performance and robustness as well as rapid convergence which are the principal criteria an estimation technique must fulfill.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.972","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"5868","endPage":"5872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of an Indoor MIMO channel in Frequency Domain using the 3D-SAGE Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of an Indoor MIMO channel in Frequency Domain using the 3D-SAGE Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289643/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875660","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289643/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of an Indoor MIMO channel in Frequency Domain using the 3D-SAGE Algorithm","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048826S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289645,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main benefit of the scheme is that it can almost achieve the optimal performance with low complexity. Next, using the moment generation function (MGF) approach and the Gauss-Chebyshev integration, we derive a simple and accurate numerical analysis method for the proposed scheme under three widely used modulations. Finally, computer simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the open-loop transmit scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.974","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289645.pdf","startPage":"5879","endPage":"5884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Transmit Beamforming with Space-Time Block Coding for Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289645/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Transmit Beamforming with Space-Time Block Coding for Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875662","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289645/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Transmit Beamforming with Space-Time Block Coding for Correlated MIMO Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057096S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289646,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Even if the scheduler assigns the resources according to the SINR, the main drawback to the practical deployment of these schemes is the intense feedback to be provided by every user. In this paper we address the sum-rate maximization of downlink multiuser MIMO space division multiple access systems based on 1-bit quantization of SINR feedback where each available spatial beam is assigned to a different user. To minimize signalling, here it is proposed a distributed method to locally estimate the optimal quantization thresholds among the terminals that guarantees a fair allocation of the available resources. Analytical results prove that the distributed scheme is asymptotically (when increasing the number of users) optimal in terms of sum-rate scaling law. Numerical simulations validate the analysis and highlight the capability of the distributed scheme to guarantee fairness constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289646.pdf","startPage":"5885","endPage":"5890","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Scheduling Algorithm for Multiuser MIMO Systems with 1-bit SINR Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Feedback","Resource management","Quantization","Array signal processing","Downlink","Antenna feeds","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","distributed algorithms","MIMO communication","optimisation","scheduling","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed scheduling algorithm","multiuser MIMO systems","SINR feedback","opportunistic scheduling","random beamforming","resource allocation","sum-rate maximization","space division multiple access systems","optimal quantization thresholds","fair allocation","fairness constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Scheduling Algorithm for Multiuser MIMO Systems with 1-bit SINR Feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289646/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875663","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Scheduling Algorithm for Multiuser MIMO Systems with 1-bit SINR Feedback","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049405S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289648,"authors":[{"name":"J.-H.

With the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing has become a viable and promising option. In this paper, we study power control for spectrum sharing among secondary users with interference temperature limit (ITL) constraints at measurement points. Each secondary user will adjust its own transmission power to make sure the overall interference at the measurement points does not exceed the required ITL. Under the assumption that each secondary user is selfish and rational while there is only limited coordination between primary users and secondary users, we study the distributed power control scheme for secondary users. In our proposed system model, secondary users generating the highest interference at a measurement point will back off their transmissions if the ITL is exceeded. A non-cooperative power control game among secondary users is proposed to maximize each user's utility. We identify the Nash equilibrium of the proposed game and analyze its property. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed solution can achieve a satisfactory performance in terms of the total transmitting rate of all the secondary users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289654/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875671","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289654/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Cooperative Power Control Game for Secondary Spectrum Sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Cooperative Power Control Game for Secondary Spectrum Sharing","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S45P27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059474S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289655,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We argue for the extension of its scope to also address the management of computing resources, including processing and bandwidth capacities of SDR platforms, and present a cooperative resource management framework: The joint radio resource management (JRRM) and the computing resources management (CRM) entities interchange information to cooperatively decide if and what kind of terminal reconfiguration would be the most appropriate in each situation. Therefore, the cognitive radio system continuously observes the radio and the computing environments. We discuss a realistic case study and present a simple CRM algorithm. Simulation results show that such a cooperative resource management approach can achieve important improvements over the JRRM by itself.

We address a number of architectural challenges pertinent to this networking environment, and evaluate the performance of the MAC. Our performance evaluation results show that, in a single-hop ad hoc network, the proposed MAC transparently utilizes 75% of the bandwidth left unused by the primary, while, in the multi-hop cases, due to spatial reuse, the bandwidth utilization can be significantly higher.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875677","htmlLink":"/document/4289660/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Medium Access Control Protocol for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Medium Access Control Protocol for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S46P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078921S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289663,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is transmitted every T symbols and T - 1 data symbols are transmitted in between the pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are optimized by maximizing this lower bound.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"5999","endPage":"6004","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289665.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Optimization for Gauss-Markov Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian channels","Fading","Transmitters","Channel capacity","Communications Society","Phase shift keying","Binary phase shift keying","Phase modulation","Additive noise","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading channels","binary phase-shift keying","BPSK modulation","additive Gaussian noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Training Optimization for Gauss-Markov Rayleigh Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289665/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289665/","accessionNumber":"9875682","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Optimization for Gauss-Markov Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S47P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05395S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289667,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

We consider three different previously proposed precoding designs, and show how to modify them to effectively mitigate asynchronous interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Fundamentally Asynchronous Nature of Interference in Cooperative Base Station Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1006","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289677.pdf","startPage":"6073","endPage":"6078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Fundamentally Asynchronous Nature of Interference in Cooperative Base Station Systems","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289677/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Fundamentally Asynchronous Nature of Interference in Cooperative Base Station Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S49P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122804S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289680,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the existing papers on cooperative diversity, the fading channels are idealistically assumed to be Rayleigh fading channel. Taking into account the realistic propagation environments in the presence of spatial fading correlation, i.e., geometry-based stochastic channel model, we study the performance of existing cooperative protocols in the two-ring scattering model. The two source nodes (SNs) and two destination nodes (DNs) form a 2times2 virtual MIMO cooperative system. Therefore, the bit error rate (BER) of cooperation at transmitter is presented in the interference relay channel. The time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is proposed with half duplex mode. Based on theoretical analyses and simulation results, the cooperative diversity brings performance improvement in correlated channel, even with the keyhole MIMO channel. And, cooperative strategy reduces the spatial correlation of each path, increases the capacity of the correlated channels and enhances the overall performance of virtual MIMO system by high quality of cooperative interuser channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Diversity for Virtual MIMO System in Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1009","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289680.pdf","startPage":"6091","endPage":"6096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Diversity for Virtual MIMO System in Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289680/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875697","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Diversity for Virtual MIMO System in Geometry-Based Stochastic Channel Model","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S09S49P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072134S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289681,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper, coded cooperation for wireless networks is considered and a novel cooperative concatenated coding strategy is proposed. In contrast to previous works, this scheme features additional coding benefits other than spatial diversity. Specifically, we show that remarkable error rate reduction can be achieved even when the receive SNR of all cooperating users is maintained at a specific level. The idea of interleaver gain of concatenated codes is exploited and it is shown that the error rate decreases dramatically with the number of cooperating nodes. Multiple cooperating users with unequal message sizes can also be supported easily and a reduced-complexity cooperative encoding structure is provided for good inter-user channels. Code design criteria are also investigated, as well as, the performance under various data-block sizes and number of cooperating users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289681/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289681/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9875698","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Concatenated Coding for Wireless Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Concatenated Coding for Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S01P01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068035S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4289682,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The network consists of statistically independent noisy channels. The sink bit error probability (BEP) is the performance measure. We first discuss soft-decision decoding without statistical information on the upstream channels (the channels not directly connected to the sink). The example shows that the decoder cannot significantly improve the BEP from the hard-decision decoder. We develop the union bound to analyze the decoding approach. The bound can show the asymptotic (regarding SNR: signal-to-noise ratio) performance. Using statistical information of the upstream channels, we then show the method of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. With the decoder, a significant improvement in the BEP is obtained. To evaluate the union bound for the ML decoder, we use an equivalent signal point procedure. It can be reduced to a least-squares problem with linear constraints for medium-to-high SNR.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1011","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289682.pdf","startPage":"6103","endPage":"6110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289682/","accessionNumber":"9875699","publicationDate":"June 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Decoding and Performance Analysis of a Noisy Channel Network with Network Coding","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085777S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289686,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To ensure correct operation and good performance, simulcast networks need accurate time and frequency synchronization. In this work, we designed a system for synchronizing RBS clocks by way of network time protocol (NTP) packets. The goal is to allow simulcast operation when external sources of synchronization, such as GPS, are not available or when the operator prefers to distribute timing alternatively, in particular by IP network facilities used for data transport. Time stamps are disseminated by a master RBS and used in slave stations to steer local clocks. The mechanism proposed was modelled, simulated and implemented in an experimental prototype. Simulation and experimental measurement results meet requirements and demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach for commercial application.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Frequency synchronization","Frequency modulation","Bit error rate","Electronic mail","Base stations","Clocks","IP networks","Master-slave","Radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocols","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-frequency simulcast networks","radio base stations","radio channel","frequency synchronization","RBS clock synchronization","network time protocol packets","IP network","data transport","time stamps","slave stations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289686","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1015","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1015","startPage":"6129","endPage":"6134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Single-Frequency Simulcast Networks Using Network Time Protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Single-Frequency Simulcast Networks Using Network Time Protocol","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289686/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289686/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875703","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Single-Frequency Simulcast Networks Using Network Time Protocol","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S01P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046757S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289690,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The algorithm uses buffer occupancy, the behavior of previous packet arrival times and a configurable maximum bounded delay to make sleeping decisions.

A key contribution to the reduction in complexity is the reuse of transform blocks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two Dimensional Equalizer Using Parallel FIR Filters for Data Storage","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1029","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289700.pdf","startPage":"6214","endPage":"6219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Two Dimensional Equalizer Using Parallel FIR Filters for Data Storage","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289700/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875716","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Dimensional Equalizer Using Parallel FIR Filters for Data Storage","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S04P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078936S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4289703,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

They are a characteristic of the parity check matrix of a code. Conventional quantization schemes applied to a (2209,1978) array-based LDPC code can induce low-weight weak absorbing sets and, as a result, elevate the error floor. Adaptive quantization schemes alleviate the effects of weak absorbing sets, and, as a result, only the strong ones dominate the error floor of an optimized decoder implementation. Another benefit of an adaptive quantization scheme is that it performs well even in very few iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1032","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289703.pdf","startPage":"6231","endPage":"6237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization Effects in Low-Density Parity-Check Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Quantization Effects in Low-Density Parity-Check Decoders","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289703/","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875719","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289703/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization Effects in Low-Density Parity-Check Decoders","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S04P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082921S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289706,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In patterned media, track pitch may be small causing adjacent tracks to have significant interference on the replay waveform from the main data track. To mitigate the effect of such inter-track interference (ITI), we propose the use of a two-dimensional (2D) generalized partial response (GPR) equalizer. We select both the equalizer and the partial response target using the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. However, we avoid the need for a 2D Viterbi algorithm by imposing a constraint on the 2D target that forces the adjacent track contributions (in the ideal case) to zero. Simulation results show that this 2D equalizer significantly improves the bit error rate (BER). In this work, the effect of a 2D GPR equalizer on the performance of a patterned media system in the presence of track misregistration (TMR) is also investigated. Based on the simulation results, the 2D equalization method appears to be more tolerant to TMR than the conventional GPR The main drawback of the proposed method is the need for simultaneously acquiring the signals from three adjacent tracks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1035","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289706.pdf","startPage":"6249","endPage":"6254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Generalized Partial Response Equalizer for Bit-Patterned Media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Generalized Partial Response Equalizer for Bit-Patterned Media","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289706/","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9892349","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Generalized Partial Response Equalizer for Bit-Patterned Media","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S05P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090843S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289708,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Recently, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) based OFDM system has received wide attentions due to several advantages. Hence, the study of frequency synchronization issue for this newly raised system is well on its time. To provide a thorough study, we consider the non-circular transmissions, and the results can be easily generated to circular transmissions if the elliptic variance is set to zero. We present three joint maximum likelihood (ML) carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase offset (PO) estimators. From both the theoretical analysis and the numerical comparisons, we found new advantages of the DCT-OFDM over the traditional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based OFDM. These advantages, as well as those already studied in the early works on DCT-OFDM, support the belief that the DCT-OFDM is a new promising multi-carrier modulation (MCM) scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML CFO and PO Estimation in DCT OFDM Systems under Non-Circular Transmissions","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1039","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289710.pdf","startPage":"6275","endPage":"6280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"ML CFO and PO Estimation in DCT OFDM Systems under Non-Circular Transmissions","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289710/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875725","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML CFO and PO Estimation in DCT OFDM Systems under Non-Circular Transmissions","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S06P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062615S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289711,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A simplified cooperative scheme is proposed to increase the sum of the mutual information of the links in all cells. The proposed simplified-cooperative scheme is realistic in that it only utilizes a limited amount of information from adjacent links, while the conventional cooperative scheme requires a large amount of information such as channel state information and MIMO transmit configurations of adjacent links. In spite of the use of a limited amount of information, the proposed scheme provides almost 90 percent of the average mutual information provided by the cooperative scheme. Furthermore, the proposed scheme shows significant enhancements over the competitive scheme which does not consider the effects of antenna subset selection on the performance of adjacent links.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1043","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289714.pdf","startPage":"6299","endPage":"6304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Subset Selection for Downlink MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289714/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Subset Selection for Downlink MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875729","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289714/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Subset Selection for Downlink MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S10S06P06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049821S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289739,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The first and probably the most challenging task for CR is to detect/sense the white space of the spectrum for its usage. In this paper, detection of DVB-T signals is studied since TV band has been considered by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to be pioneered for CR usage. Cyclostationary feature of DVB signals is explored so that the robust single-cycle detector (SCD) can be employed to handle the problem of noise uncertainty, to which the widely used energy detector (ED) is susceptible.

The focus of this work is on design and evaluation of three key components of the control protocol - bootstrapping, discovery and naming/addressing. The bootstrapping protocol uses beacons to inform neighboring nodes about a node's PHY/MAC capabilities and current status. The network discovery protocol helps nodes to obtain a global view of reachability and end-to-end paths in the network by exchanging and propagating local link states. Further, nodes obtain their IP addresses and perform name to network address translations using a distributed naming/addressing scheme. An ns2 simulation model of the cognitive radio network with global control has been developed and used to evaluate performance in terms of network setup time, control overhead and achievable data throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289740/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9875755","publicationDate":"June 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289740/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Global Control Plane Architecture for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global Control Plane Architecture for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S01P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076041S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289742,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Due to hardware limitations and energy constraints, a secondary user can choose, in each slot, one channel to sense and decide whether to access based on the sensing outcome. The design of sensing strategies that govern channel selections in each slot for optimal throughput performance of the secondary user can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We exploit the structure of this problem when channels are independently and identically distributed. We reveal that the myopic sensing policy has a simple structure: channel selection is reduced to a counting process with little complexity. Further, for the two-channel case, we prove that the myopic sensing policy is in fact the optimal policy. Numerical results have also demonstrated the optimality of the myopic sensing policy when there are more than two channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1071","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289742.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1071","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"6476","endPage":"6481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure and Optimality of Myopic Sensing for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Structure and Optimality of Myopic Sensing for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289742/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289742/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875757","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure and Optimality of Myopic Sensing for Opportunistic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S01P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067078S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289743,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, the simplest and most common forms of such constraints are binary and transmitter-centric, which are often inefficient since they only consider pair-wise sets of transmitters. Hence, we propose a non-binary receiver-centric constraint model for spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Such a model is in line with the recently proposed interference temperature metric that constraints whole subsets of transmitters, thereby permitting interfering signals to be introduced and enabling additional communication, leading to improved spectrum utilisation. These constraints are easy to generate and check, and are currently being used to devise a co-operative negotiated etiquette for cognitive radios offering heterogeneous services in a wireless office networking scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289745/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875760","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modelling Interference Temperature Constraints for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling Interference Temperature Constraints for Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S01P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062588S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289746,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Existing routing proposals help nodes select frequency bands without considering the effect of band switching and intra-band backoff. In this paper, We propose a joint interaction between on-demand routing and spectrum scheduling. A node analytical model is proposed to describe the scheduling-based channel assignment progress, which relief the inter-flow interference and frequent switching delay. We also use an on-demand interaction to derive a cumulative delay based routing protocol. Simulation results show that, comparing to other approaches, our protocol provides better adaptability to the multi- flow environment and derives paths with much lower cumulative delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9875761","htmlLink":"/document/4289746/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint On-Demand Routing and Spectrum Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint On-Demand Routing and Spectrum Assignment in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S01P08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050611S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":4289748,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In this paper, we first give a brief overview of the envisioned applications of cooperative technology to cognitive radio, distinguishing among cooperative sensing for detection of the primary activity, cooperative transmission between secondary nodes and cooperative transmission of primary traffic by secondary users (cognitive relaying). Then, we focus on the latter scenario and investigate a simple wireless network, where one secondary transmitter has the option to relay traffic of the primary. Assuming that the primary is oblivious to the presence of the secondary (thus excluding the possibility of spectrum leasing), the secondary transmitter optimizes transmission/ relaying parameters towards the goal of maximizing the rate towards the secondary receiver. Numerical results are provided in order to discuss the advantage and limits of cognitive relaying.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2007.1077","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289748.pdf","startPage":"6511","endPage":"6515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperation and Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289748/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation and Cognitive Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875763","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289748/","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation and Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S02P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110481S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4289749,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The open spectrum allocation scheme has potential to provide those networks more capacity, and make them more flexible and reliable. However, the freedom brought by the new spectrum usage paradigm introduces spectrum management and network coordination challenges. In this paper, we study the network formation problem in cognitive radio based mesh networks. A cluster-based approach is proposed to form a mesh network in the context of cognitive radio scenario. Moreover, a topology management algorithm is developed to optimize the cluster configuration with regard to the network topology. The prominent feature of the proposed approach lies in the capability to adapt the cluster configuration to network and radio environment changes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2007.1078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4288671","startPage":"6516","endPage":"6521","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4288670/4288671/04289749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Management in CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Mesh Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289749/","displayDocTitle":"Topology Management in CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Mesh Network","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9875764","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Management in CogMesh: A Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Mesh Network","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"S11S02P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040088S","chronDate":"24-28 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4288670","isNumber":"4288671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4288670","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4288671","articleId":"4289749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4289750,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

An adaptive OFDM based cognitive radio system has the capacity to nullify individual carriers to avoid interference to the licensed user. Therefore, there could be a considerably large number of zero-valued inputs/outputs for the IFFT/FFT in the OFDM transceiver. Due to the wasted operations on zero values, the standard FFT is no longer efficient. Based on this observation, we propose to use a computationally efficient IFFT/FFT as an option for OFDM based cognitive radio.

The C-V characterization of M/BLT/Si and M/BLT/SiO2/Si capacitors were studied. It is found that the charges in silicon injected into BLT ferroelectric films, and p-n injection effect existed between the film and Si (F-S) interface, which changed the polarization state in FEM capacitors. The introduction of SiO2 buffer layer could decrease the charge injection effect, and the polarization storage of FEM capacitors could be realized. A physical model based on the consideration energy-band theory has been constructed in explaining the p-n injection effect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289781/","conferenceDate":"3-4 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 June 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289781/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"M/Bi3.4La0.6Ti3O12/I/Si capacitors for the application in FEDRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M/Bi3.4La0.6Ti3O12/I/Si capacitors for the application in FEDRAM","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"EDST-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049464S","chronDate":"3-4 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4289754","isNumber":"4289755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289754","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4289755","articleId":"4289781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":4289803,"authors":[{"name":"Yonggen Liu","affiliation":["IC Design Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yonggen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37933992800"},{"name":"Jian You","affiliation":["IC Design Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"You","id":"37088329456"},{"name":"Ping Luo","affiliation":["IC Design Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Luo","id":"37412836900"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["IC Design Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279403200"},{"name":"Zhaoji Li","affiliation":["IC Design Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoji","lastName":"Li","id":"37279076800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1097-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1098-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4289803","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","CMOS technology","Stability","Poles and zeros","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Power supplies","Gain","Power dissipation","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-stage amplifier","low-voltage","CPSZ","Large load capacitance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289803","abstract":"A novel super-bandwidth three-stage amplifier with a new stability method are proposed in this paper.

The number of security-breaking attempts originated inside the organizations is increasing steadily. Attacks made in this way, usually done by \"authorized\" users of the system, cannot be immediately traced. As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a framework for a statistical anomaly prediction system using a neuro-genetic forecasting model, which predicts unauthorized invasions of user, based on previous observations and takes further action before intrusion occurs. We propose an evolutionary time-series model for adaptive network intrusion forecasting where the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is trained using genetic algorithm. The learning of the ANN is formulated as a weight optimization problem. The experimental results show that the combination strategy (neuro-genetic) can quicken the learning speed of the network and improve the predicting precision compared to the traditional ANN (Back Propagation Network). A comparative evaluation of the proposed neuro-genetic model with the traditional back-propagation, on audit data set provided by MIT Lincoln labs, has been presented and a better prediction accuracy has been observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","accessionNumber":"9703686","htmlLink":"/document/4289880/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Neuro-genetic ensemble Short Term Forecasting Framework for Anomaly Intrusion Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neuro-genetic ensemble Short Term Forecasting Framework for Anomaly Intrusion Prediction","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070123S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4289832","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4289833","articleId":"4289880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289897,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Development of a biometric system for personal identification, which fulfills the requirements for access control of secured areas and other applications like identity validation for social welfare, crime detection, ATM access, computer security, etc. is felt to be the need of the day. Face recognition has been evolving as a convenient biometric mode for human authentication for more than last two decades. Several vendors around the world claim the successful working of their face recognition systems. However, the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISI), USA, indicates that the commercial face recognition systems do not perform up to the mark under the variations ubiquitously present in a real-life situation. Availability of a largely accepted robust face recognition system has proved elusive so far. Keeping in view the importance of indigenous development of biometric systems to cater to the requirements at BARC and elsewhere in the country, the work was started on the development of a face-based biometric authentication system. In this paper, we discuss our efforts in developing a face recognition system that functions successfully under a reasonably constrained set-up for facial image acquisition. The prototype system built in our lab finds facial match by utilizing multi-algorithmic multi-biometric technique, combining gray level statistical correlation method with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) techniques in order to boost our system performance. After automatic detection of the face in the image and its gross scale correction, its PCA and DCT signatures are extracted. Based on a comparison of the extracted signature with the set of references, the set of top five hits are selected. Exact scale of the face is ascertained w.r.t. each of these hits by first locating the eyes employing template matching technique and then finding the inter-ocular distance. After interpolating the face to the exact scale, matching scores are computed based on gray level correlation of a number of features on the face. Final identification decision is taken amongst this set of five faces, depending on the highest score. We have tested the technique on a set of 109 images belonging to 43 subjects, both male and female. The result on this image-set indicates 89% success rate of our technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4289832/4289833/04289908.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4289833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Algorithmic Face Recognition System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Biometrics","Principal component analysis","Discrete cosine transforms","Face detection","Authentication","Access control","Application software","Computer security","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","correlation methods","digital signatures","discrete cosine transforms","face recognition","feature extraction","image matching","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["principal component analysis signature","discrete cosine transform signature","automatic face detection","gross scale correction","template matching","multialgorithmic face recognition system","personal authenticity","personal identification","access control","human authentication","face recognition vendor test","face-based biometric authentication system","facial image acquisition","statistical correlation method","interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Identification","Multi-algorithmic","Multi-biometric","Discrete Cosine Transform","Principal Component Analysis","Correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Algorithmic Face Recognition System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703714","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Algorithmic Face Recognition System","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057552S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4289832","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4289833","articleId":"4289908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4289909,"authors":[{"name":"Ramaswamy Palaniappan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Essex, Colchester, UK"],"firstName":"Ramaswamy","lastName":"Palaniappan","id":"37293285800"},{"name":"Shankar M.

The power of GAs for solving complex problems is highly used in the design of parallel problem solving machines. High parallelism needs higher number of parallel processors to be used simultaneously. This approach may be costly in terms of efficiency and utilization of processors. GAs are time costly processes mainly because of their time consuming evaluation operations. Development of a low cost hardware evaluation unit may help reducing time complexities of GAs. In this paper, an attempt is made to show how the fitness evaluation operation of any genetically encoded problem can be performed by using a simple hardware. Our hardware uses a postfix notation of the fitness expression. Since, in GAs, the same function is evaluated for a fairly large number of times, we need to compile a postfix expression only once at the beginning of the genetic optimization process. We performed some simulation experiments on function optimization problems, in general.

Bannister,<br>in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2004, vol.3, pp. 1720-1724, June 2004<br><br>  <br/> Optical CDMA local area networks allow shared access to a broadcast medium. Every node is assigned an optical orthogonal codeword (OOC) to transmit or receive on. Optical CDMA systems have low throughput under moderate to heavy offered load due to interference between codewords. Interference Sensing is a media access architecture where nodes on the network sense the amount of interference on the line before transmission. Nodes defer transmissions if there is interference on the line. This paper discusses and analyzes three algorithms for interference sensing. Through simulation it is shown that these algorithms reduce or eliminate throughput degradation at high loads. The study shows that simple algorithms such as selfish or threshold based algorithms are sufficient to eliminate throughput degradation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4289832/4289833/04289923.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4289833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Interference Detection in Optical CDMA Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Interference Detection in Optical CDMA Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703729","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: Interference Detection in Optical CDMA Networks","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03776S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","articleId":"4289923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289929,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Constructions of 2-D codes, suitable for incoherent W/T FO-CDMA, have been proposed to reduce the time spread of the 1-D sequences. The 2-D constructions can be broadly classified as 1) hybrid codes and 2) matrix codes. In our earlier work, we had proposed a new family of wavelength/time multiple-pulses-per-row (W/TMPR) matrix codes which have good cardinality, spectral efficiency and at the same time have the lowest off-peak autocorrelation and cross-correlation values equal to unity. In this paper, we propose an architecture for a W/T MPR FO-CDMA network designed using the presently available devices and technology. A complete FO-CDMA network of ten users is simulated, for various number of simultaneous users and shown that 0 rarr 1 errors can occur only when the number of interfering users is at least equal to the threshold value.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289929","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4289832/4289833/04289929.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4289833","startPage":"423","endPage":"428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of Wavelength/Time Multiple-Pulses-Per-Row Fiber-Optic CDMA Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of Wavelength/Time Multiple-Pulses-Per-Row Fiber-Optic CDMA Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289929/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703735","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4289929/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of Wavelength/Time Multiple-Pulses-Per-Row Fiber-Optic CDMA Network","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057146S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4289832","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4289833","articleId":"4289929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4289943,"authors":[{"name":"Steevan Rodrigues","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, NITK, Suratkal, India"],"firstName":"Steevan","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37088256339"},{"name":"M S Bhat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Suratkal, India"],"firstName":"M S","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37721467100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0715-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0716-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4289943","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":480},"abstract":"Sense amplifier is a very critical peripheral circuit in memories as its performance strongly affects both memory access time, and overall memory power dissipation. As the device dimensions scale below 100nm, the process variations are increasing and are impacting the circuit design significantly. The circuit yield loss caused by the process and device parameter variation has been more pronounced than before [1]. In this paper, effects of process variation induced transistor mismatch on sense amplifier performance are studied. A comparative study of the effect of mismatch on delay and yield for different sense amplifier configurations at 90nm technology is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Threshold voltage","CMOS technology","Circuits","MOSFETs","Power amplifiers","Differential amplifiers","Fabrication","Delay","Fluctuations","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network synthesis","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process variation induced transistor mismatch","sense amplifier performance","peripheral circuit","memory access time","memory power dissipation","circuit design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289943","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4289832/4289833/04289943.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4289833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Process Variation Induced Transistor Mismatch on Sense Amplifier Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Process Variation Induced Transistor Mismatch on Sense Amplifier Performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289943/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289943/","accessionNumber":"9703749","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Process Variation Induced Transistor Mismatch on Sense Amplifier Performance","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046662S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4289832","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4289833","articleId":"4289943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4289956,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Although only two bits are sufficient to encode four bases of DNA ( namely A, G, T and C ), the massive size DNA sequences compels the need for efficient compression. General text compression methods do not make use of characteristics specific to DNA sequences. DNA specific compression algorithms usually take advantage of repeat sequences. DNA sequences with high repetition rates can be best compressed by dictionary-based compression algorithms. However segments of DNA that do not reappear in the sequence are compressed using different text compression scheme. In this paper, we propose an encoding scheme to compress non repeat regions of DNA sequences, based on dynamic programming approach. In order to test the efficiency of the method we incorporate the encoding scheme in a DNA-specific algorithm, DNAPack. The performance of this algorithm is compared with various DNA compression algorithms. The results show that our method achieve better results in many cases.","doi":"10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289956","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4289832/4289833/04289956.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4289833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Compression of non-repetitive DNA sequences using Dynamic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4289956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4289956/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Compression of non-repetitive DNA sequences using Dynamic Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9703762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4289956/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Compression of non-repetitive DNA sequences using Dynamic Programming","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"ADCOM-00-123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078876S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4289832","isNumber":"4289833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4289832","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4289833","articleId":"4289956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4289958,"authors":[{"name":"Archana Bhise","affiliation":["K.
