Firstly, we analyse the statistical characteristics of the three types of frames, which the MPEG algorithm generates, and we study their autocovariance and probability density functions. Based on the data analysis, we propose two new source models which approximate both the statistical properties and the traffic characterization of MPEG sequences. The second source model (model B) has been introduced in order to reduce significantly the number of parameters which are necessary for our modeling. To verify the good fitness of the proposed new models, a statistical multiplexing configuration over ATM B-ISDN networks has been implemented and cell as well as frame loss probability have been estimated when the bit stream of video sources is generated by the real data and the two proposed models.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610001","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","startPage":"856","endPage":"861 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance models for multiplexed VBR MPEG video sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=610001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance models for multiplexed VBR MPEG video sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610001/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793832","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance models for multiplexed VBR MPEG video sources","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034032S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"7","articleId":"610001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":610009,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

For a direct sequence (DS) CDMA system like in the uplink of the standard IS-95(A) using M-ary orthogonal modulation (inner code) and an outer convolutional code with interleaving we give the optimum symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding rules for the inner block code in a coherent and noncoherent receiver design. Further suggestions for suboptimum MAP decoders with lower complexity are made. The inner decoding rule is extended to use a priori information for the systematic bits, which is delivered from the outer decoding stage. These algorithms are essential for iterative decoding of the system. Simulation results show a decoding gain of about 0.6 dB for a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -3/ by replacing the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for the inner code by a MAP decoder. A total gain of about 1.2 dB is achieved by the use of iterative decoding after only three to five iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610011","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610011.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"913 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative decoding and despreading improves CDMA-systems using M-ary orthogonal modulation and FEC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Iterative decoding and despreading improves CDMA-systems using M-ary orthogonal modulation and FEC","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793842","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative decoding and despreading improves CDMA-systems using M-ary orthogonal modulation and FEC","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087703S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"14","articleId":"610011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":610012,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We consider three solutions capable of simplifying the system. First, we consider differential encoding, so that phase estimation is not required. The second solution consists of the use of special coding schemes that are capable of spreading the information bits among the subcarriers, so that the BER performance is not deteriorated by badly attenuated subcarriers. Two coding schemes are compared, a Walsh coding scheme and 4-state trellis-coded modulation. As a third solution, we consider a Nyquist sampling rate OFDM. We show that the Nyquist sampling rate OFDM signal, which is supposed to be dependent on a perfect receiver timing, can be made resistant to a receiver timing mismatch by using the coding schemes and by decreasing the rolloff factor of the Nyquist pulse, with extra benefits of greater bandwidth efficiency and lower added noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5793847","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coded OFDM for broadband indoor wireless systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded OFDM for broadband indoor wireless systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033412S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"16","articleId":"610016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":610017,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Simulated BER performance in AWGN and interference is presented for systems that use a number of different block transforms and the modulated lapped transform (MLT) and it is shown that the MLT provides much better performance due to its ability to confine the interference energy to a few transform bins.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610018.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"948 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=610018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM spread spectrum communications using lapped transforms and interference excision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Interference","OFDM modulation","Laboratories","Discrete Fourier transforms","Bit error rate","AWGN","Carrier confinement","Design methodology","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","frequency division multiplexing","white noise","Gaussian noise","interference suppression","error statistics","diversity reception","transforms","jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","spread spectrum communication","lapped transforms","interference excision","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","performance evaluation","pulsed Gaussian interference","tone interference","frequency diversity","time diversity","detection process","receivers","BER performance","AWGN","block transforms","modulated lapped transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"OFDM spread spectrum communications using lapped transforms and interference excision","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM spread spectrum communications using lapped transforms and interference excision","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041862S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"7","articleId":"610018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":610020,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Transmitting high-speed data over wireless channels, however, is a difficult task. Recently, a new technique, known as multicode modulation, has been proposed to transmit high-speed data over wireless links. In this method, the high-rate information bits are serial-to-parallel converted to low-rate bit streams. Then the low-rate bits are modulated by direct sequence spread spectrum on a single carrier. The objective of this paper is to propose a low-complexity receiver structure for multicode modulation which uses fast Walsh transform (FWT). In addition, we will demonstrate that the use of coding in multicode modulation can significantly improve the system performance. Sample numerical results which illustrate the potential of multicode modulation with turbo-codes and convolutional codes over multipath Rayleigh fading channels will also be presented.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610021.pdf","endPage":"963 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed data transmission with multicode modulation and turbo-codes for wireless personal communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610021","startPage":"959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=610021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"High-speed data transmission with multicode modulation and turbo-codes for wireless personal communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610021/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5793852","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed data transmission with multicode modulation and turbo-codes for wireless personal communications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027868S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"6","articleId":"610021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":610024,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We show that the performance gain of the minimum-BER equalizer over the minimum-MSE equalizer is most pronounced when the number of equalizer coefficients is small relative to the severity of the intersymbol interference. We propose a simple stochastic gradient algorithm that approximately minimizes BER in the presence of linear intersymbol interference and white Gaussian noise. Computer simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to the popular least-mean-square algorithm in terms of both steady-state performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610057","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610057.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1099 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate minimum bit-error rate equalization for binary signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=610057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate minimum bit-error rate equalization for binary signaling","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610057/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate minimum bit-error rate equalization for binary signaling","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033375S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"28","articleId":"610057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":610058,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The channel varies with both fast Rayleigh fading and slow log-normal shadowing. We assume that the fast fading is estimated perfectly, and that the estimation error of the shadowing is log-normally distributed. This estimation error leads to a change in the average transmit power and rate of the adaptive modulation. We characterize these changes for two adaptive modulation schemes: variable-rate variable-power MQAM, where the average data rate is maximized, and fixed-rate MQAM, where the transmit power is adapted to invert the signal fading. The shadowing estimation error affects these two modulation techniques in opposite ways: the data rate and dB power changes resulting from the error are positive for variable-rate variable-power MQAM, and negative for fixed-rate MQAM. In both cases, however, the changes are very small.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1997.610059","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC'97 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4646/13367/00610059.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1997.610059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13367","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1109 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of average power estimation error on adaptive MQAM modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=610059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of average power estimation error on adaptive MQAM modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610059/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5793880","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of average power estimation error on adaptive MQAM modulation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00610059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036635S","chronDate":"8-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4646","citationCount":"11","articleId":"610059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":610237,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

Given a batch recipe, the trained neural networks can predict polymer quality variables during the course of polymerisation. A main factor affecting prediction accuracy is reactive impurities which commonly exist in industrial polymerisation reactors. The amount of reactive impurities can be estimated online during the initial stage of polymerisation using another neural network. Accurate predictions of polymer quality variables can then be obtained from the effective batch initial conditions. The technique can be used to design optimal batch recipes and to monitor polymerisation processes.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.610645","pdfPath":"/iel3/4827/13370/00610645.pdf","startPage":"1370","endPage":"1374 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

Choice of multiple OAFNNs allows a reduction in overall network size reducing the computational requirements. The network weights are tuned online in real time. The overall stability of the system and the neural networks is guaranteed using Lyapunov analysis.

The optimal control method implemented is based on the loop transfer recovery (LTR) technique, and the basis for signal representation is composed of Daubechies wavelets. Averaging the optimal controllers obtained at three representative equilibrium states followed by using the adjustment control signal leads to a single structure capable of controlling the system over a wider range of operation. A simple inverted pendulum example is presented, and an averaging optimal controller is designed. The neural network is used to represent an adjustment control signal by a linear combination of six wavelets. The resulting signal is incorporated with the averaging LTR controller in order to enhance its performance. Simulation results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.610817","startPage":"1551","endPage":"1555 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

Tracking sinusoidal and ramp signals","abstract":"For part 1, see Proc. of 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, p.726-31 (1996). This paper continues the earlier work on optimal tracking problems with respect to multivariable feedback systems. We examine the error between a system's output response and its command input, which is either a sinusoidal or a ramp signal. This error is quantified under an integral square criterion, and is adopted as a measure of tracking accuracy. For both sinusoidal and ramp signals, we derive explicit expressions of the minimal tracking error attainable by all possible stabilizing controllers. These results show that the tracking accuracy may be fundamentally limited by plant nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles together with their spatial properties, in ways dependent upon the command input signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/610886/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6027306","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Limitations on maximal tracking accuracy. 2.

Even if a good model of the nonlinear system is known, it is often difficult to formulate a control law. The work in this paper addresses this problem by showing how a NN can cope with nonlinearities through reinforcement learning with no preliminary off-line learning phase required. The learning is performed online based on a binary reinforcement signal from a critic without knowing the nonlinearity appearing in the system. The algorithm is derived from Lyapunov stability analysis, so that both system tracking stability and error convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.610896","startPage":"1804","endPage":"1808 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

Specifically, we attempt to develop a basic understanding, using analysis and simulation, of the properties of TCP/IP in a regime where: (1) the bandwidth-delay product of the network is high compared to the buffering in the network and (2) packets may incur random loss (e.g., due to transient congestion caused by fluctuations in real-time traffic, or wireless links in the path of the connection). The following key results are obtained. First, random loss leads to significant throughput deterioration when the product of the loss probability and the square of the bandwidth-delay product is larger than one. Second, for multiple connections sharing a bottleneck link, TCP is grossly unfair toward connections with higher round-trip delays. This means that a simple first in first out (FIFO) queueing discipline might not suffice for data traffic in WANs. Finally, while the Reno version of TCP produces less bursty traffic than the original Tahoe version, it is less robust than the latter when successive losses are closely spaced.

An array of antennas mounted on vehicles, ships, aircraft, satellites, and base stations is expected to play an important role in fulfilling the increased demand of channel requirement for these services, as well as for the realization of the dream that a portable communications device the size of a wristwatch be available at an affordable cost for such services. This paper is the first of a two-part study. It provides a comprehensive treatment, at a level appropriate to nonspecialists, of the use of an antenna array to enhance the efficiency of mobile communications systems. It presents an overview of mobile communications as well as details of how an array may be used in various mobile communications systems, including land-mobile, indoor-radio, and satellite-based systems. It discusses advantages of an array of antennas in a mobile communications system, highlights improvements that are possible by using multiple antennas compared to a single antenna in a system, and provides details on the feasibility of antenna arrays for mobile communications applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611108/","volume":"85","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"5689323","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applications of antenna arrays to mobile communications.

A driving force behind this growth was the development of multipoint audio, video, and shared whiteboard conferencing applications. Because these real-time media are transmitted at a uniform rate to all of the receivers in the network, a source must either run at the bottleneck rate or overload portions of its multicast distribution tree. We overcome this limitation by moving the burden of rate adaptation from the source to the receivers with a scheme we call receiver-driven layered multicast, or RLM. In RLM, a source distributes a hierarchical signal by striping the different layers across multiple multicast groups, and receivers adjust their reception rate by simply joining and leaving multicast groups. We describe a layered video compression algorithm which, when combined with RLM, provides a comprehensive solution for scalable multicast video transmission in heterogeneous networks. In addition to a layered representation, our coder has low complexity (admitting an efficient software implementation) and high loss resilience (admitting robust operation in loosely controlled environments like the Internet). Even with these constraints, our hybrid DCT/wavelet-based coder exhibits good compression performance. It outperforms all publicly available Internet video codecs while maintaining comparable run-time performance. We have implemented our coder in a \"real\" application-the UCB/LBL videoconferencing tool vic. Unlike previous work on layered video compression and transmission, we have built a fully operational system that is currently being deployed on a very large scale over the MBone.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/13347/00611154.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"1001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.611154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.611154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity video coding for receiver-driven layered multicast","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Video compression","Large-scale systems","Internet","Video sharing","Videoconference","Multicast algorithms","Resilience","Robust control","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","adaptive signal processing","transform coding","discrete cosine transforms","wavelet transforms","Internet","video codecs","teleconferencing","data compression","telecommunication channels","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity video coding","receiver driven layered multicast","Internet Multicast Backbone","MBone","real-time media","multipoint audio","shared whiteboard conferencing","multicast distribution tree","rate adaptation","hierarchical signal","multiple multicast groups","reception rate","layered video compression algorithm","scalable multicast video transmission","heterogeneous networks","software implementation","high loss resilience","hybrid DCT/wavelet based coder","compression performance","run-time performance","UCB/LBL videoconferencing tool","vic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity video coding for receiver-driven layered multicast","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5667213","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity video coding for receiver-driven layered multicast","sourcePdf":"00611154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074435S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"379","articleId":"611154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611156,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["Integrated Media Systems Center, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chi-Yuan Hsu","id":"37614023800"},{"name":"A.

However, realistic VBR transmission environments will certainly impose constraints on the rate that each source can submit to the network. We formalize the problem of optimizing the quality of the transmitted video by jointly selecting the source rate (number of bits used for a given frame) and the channel rate (number of bits transmitted during a given frame interval). This selection is subject to two sets of constraints, namely, (1) the end-to-end delay has to be constant to allow for real-time video display and (2) the transmission rate has to be consistent with the traffic parameters negotiated by user and network. For a general class of constraints, including such popular ones as the leaky bucket, we introduce an algorithm to find the optimal solution to this problem. This algorithm allows us to compare VBR and CBR under the same end-to-end delay constraints. Our results indicate that variable-rate transmission can increase the quality of the decoded sequences without increases in the end-to-end delay. Finally, we show that for the leaky-bucket channel, the channel constraints can be combined with the buffer constraints, such that the system is identical to CBR transmission with an additional, infrequently imposed constraint. Therefore, video quality with a leaky-bucket channel can achieve the same quality of a CBR channel with larger physical buffers, without adding to the physical delay in the system.","doi":"10.1109/49.611156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/13347/00611156.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.611156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint selection of source and channel rate for VBR video transmission under ATM policing constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Joint selection of source and channel rate for VBR video transmission under ATM policing constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611156/","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5667215","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint selection of source and channel rate for VBR video transmission under ATM policing constraints","sourcePdf":"00611156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056132S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"109","articleId":"611156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":611158,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We investigate two fundamental approaches for extracting the model parameters: using sample path and second-order statistics-based methods. The model exhibits the following two canonical queueing behaviors. When strict stability conditions are satisfied, i.e., the conditional mean of each scene is smaller than the capacity of the server, precise modeling of the interscene dynamics (long-term dependency) is not essential for the accurate prediction of small to moderately large queue sizes. In this case, the queue length distribution is determined using quasistationary (perturbation theory) analysis. When weak stability conditions are satisfied, i.e., the conditional mean of at least one scene type is greater than the capacity of the server, the dominant effect for building a large queue size is the subexponential (long-tailed) scene length distribution. In this case, precise modeling of intrascene statistics is of secondary importance for predicting the large queueing behavior. A fluid model, whose arrival process is obtained from the video data by replacing scene statistics with their means, is shown to asymptotically converge to the exact queue distribution. Using the transition scenario of moving from one stability region to the other by a change in the value of the server capacity, we synthesize recent queueing theoretic advances and ad hoc results in video modeling, and unify a broad range of seemingly contradictory experimental observations found in the literature. As a word of caution for the widespread usage of second-order statistics modeling methods, we construct two processes with the same second-order statistics that produce distinctly different queueing behaviors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5667218","displayDocTitle":"The effect of multiple time scales and subexponentiality in MPEG video streams on queueing behavior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of multiple time scales and subexponentiality in MPEG video streams on queueing behavior","sourcePdf":"00611159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048717S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"71","articleId":"611159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611161,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37287470000"},{"name":"Jen-Tsung Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Tsung Hu","id":"37366049900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"611161","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Recurrent neural networks","Pipeline processing","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Autoregressive processes","Signal processing","Computational complexity","Error correction","Communication system traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","code standards","telecommunication standards","recurrent neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","prediction theory","pipeline processing","telecommunication computing","autoregressive moving average processes","least mean squares methods","computational complexity","multimedia communication","simulated annealing","adaptive systems","telecommunication traffic","visual communication","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction","modeling","MPEG video","ATM networks","pipelined recurrent neural networks","adaptive traffic prediction","general nonlinear autoregressive moving average process","minimum mean-squared error predictor","NARMA model","video traffic signal","small-scale recurrent neural network modules","computational complexity","adaptive learning","excessive load","computational efficiency","convergence performance","learning-rate annealing schedule","dynamic environment"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the application of a pipelined recurrent neural network (PRNN) to the adaptive traffic prediction of MPEG video signal via dynamic ATM networks. The traffic signal of each picture type (I, P, and B) of MPEG video is characterized by a general nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) process. Moreover, a minimum mean-squared error predictor based on the NARMA model is developed to provide the best prediction for the video traffic signal. However, the explicit functional expression of the best mean-squared error predictor is actually unknown. To tackle this difficulty, a PRNN that consists of a number of simpler small-scale recurrent neural network (RNN) modules with less computational complexity is conducted to introduce the best nonlinear approximation capability into the minimum mean-squared error predictor model in order to accurately predict the future behavior of MPEG video traffic in a relatively short time period based on adaptive learning for each module from previous measurement data, in order to provide faster and more accurate control action to avoid the effects of excessive load situation. Since those modules of PRNN can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would lead to a significant improvement in the total computational efficiency of PRNN. In order to further improve the convergence performance of the adaptive algorithm for PRNN, a learning-rate annealing schedule is proposed to accelerate the adaptive learning process. Another advantage of the PRNN-based predictor is its generalization from learning that is useful for learning a dynamic environment for MPEG video traffic prediction in ATM networks where observations may be incomplete, delayed, or partially available. The PRNN-based predictor presented in this paper is shown to be promising and practically feasible in obtaining the best adaptive prediction of real-time MPEG video traffic.","doi":"10.1109/49.611161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/13347/00611161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.611161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13347","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction and modeling of MPEG video in ATM networks using pipelined recurrent neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction and modeling of MPEG video in ATM networks using pipelined recurrent neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5667220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal nonlinear adaptive prediction and modeling of MPEG video in ATM networks using pipelined recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00611161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059017S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","articleId":"611161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":611165,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Li Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesotat Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN, USA","University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi-Li Zhang","id":"37087156562"},{"name":"J.

A number of researchers have considered transmitting stored video from server to a client using smoothing algorithms to reduce this rate variability. These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities and determine a \"smooth\" rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. We investigate how video smoothing impacts the statistical multiplexing gains available with such traffic, and we show that a significant amount of statistical multiplexing gains can still be achieved. We then examine the implication of these results on network resource management and call admission control when transmitting smoothed stored video using VBR service with statistical quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Specifically, we present a uniform call admission control scheme based on a Chernoff bound method that uses a simple, novel traffic model requiring only a few parameters. This scheme provides an easy and flexible mechanism for supporting multiple VBR service classes with different QoS requirements. We evaluate the efficacy of the call admission control scheme over a set of MPEG-1 coded video tracts.","doi":"10.1109/49.611165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.611165","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/13347/00611165.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smoothing, statistical multiplexing, and call admission control for stored video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Smoothing, statistical multiplexing, and call admission control for stored video","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5667224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611165/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smoothing, statistical multiplexing, and call admission control for stored video","sourcePdf":"00611165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152178S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"85","articleId":"611165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611169,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

By placing signal processing circuitry on the imaging focal plane, the image sensor can output data at varying resolutions which can decrease the computational load of downstream image processing. For instance, software intensive image pyramid reconstruction can be eliminated. The circuit uses a passive switched capacitor network to average arbitrarily large neighborhoods of pixels which can then be read out at any user-defined resolution by configuring a set of digital shift registers. The full resolution frame rate is 30 Hz with higher rates for all other image resolutions. The sensor achieved 80 dB of dynamic range while dissipating only 5 mW of power.

Based on measured execution times, the viability of the CNN implementation of efficient but computationally expensive compression algorithms such as dynamic image coding is assessed.","doi":"10.1109/76.611172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/13348/00611172.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.611172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results and measurements related to some tasks in object-oriented dynamic image coding using CNN universal chips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"New results and measurements related to some tasks in object-oriented dynamic image coding using CNN universal chips","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5676606","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results and measurements related to some tasks in object-oriented dynamic image coding using CNN universal chips","sourcePdf":"00611172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06282S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","articleId":"611172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611173,"authors":[{"name":"Hualu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Hualu Wang","id":"37615937500"},{"name":"Shih-Fu Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Shih-Fu Chang","id":"37281064000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"611173","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":196,"citationCountPatent":86,"totalDownloads":721},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611173","abstract":"Human faces provide a useful cue in indexing video content. We present a highly efficient system that can rapidly detect human face regions in MPEG video sequences. The underlying algorithm takes the inverse quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of MPEG video as the input, and outputs the locations of the detected face regions. The algorithm consists of three stages, where chrominance, shape, and frequency information are used, respectively. By detecting faces directly in the compressed domain, there is no need to carry out the inverse DCT transform, so that the algorithm can run faster than the real time. In our experiments, the algorithm detected 85-92% of the faces in three test sets, including both intraframe and interframe coded image frames from news video. The average run time ranges from 13-33 ms per frame. The algorithm can be applied to JPEG unconstrained images or motion JPEG video as well.","doi":"10.1109/76.611173","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"615","endPage":"628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/13348/00611173.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.611173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly efficient system for automatic face region detection in MPEG video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Discrete cosine transforms","Humans","Video compression","Indexing","Video sequences","Transform coding","Shape","Frequency","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","video coding","telecommunication standards","image sequences","image segmentation","face recognition","transform coding","discrete cosine transforms","inverse problems","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic face region detection","MPEG video","video content indexing","human face region detection","MPEG video sequences","inverse quantized discrete cosine transform","DCT coefficients","chrominance","shape","frequency information","compressed domain","experiments","test sets","interframe coded image frames","intraframe coded image frames","news video","average run time","JPEG unconstrained images","motion JPEG video","fast algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"A highly efficient system for automatic face region detection in MPEG video","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5669832","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611173/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly efficient system for automatic face region detection in MPEG video","sourcePdf":"00611173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076283S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"196","articleId":"611173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":611176,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.-H.

In addition, the channel complexity of multipoint-to multipoint multicast applications can be reduced to N channels per N users.

The more efficient algorithms for real data are those that are derived from the algorithms for complex data. So far, all such algorithms use a real array to store the data. However, as the data values are real and their transform values are mostly complex, two possible data structures can be used for these algorithms: real or complex. DFT algorithms for real data that use a complex array for storing both the real data and their transform values are derived from the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 algorithm for complex data. This approach reduces the number of bit-reversal and array-index updating operations, eliminates independent data-swapping operations, and yields a computational structure that is almost as regular as that of the algorithms for complex data. Detailed derivations of the proposed algorithms for the computation of both the DFT of real data and the inverse DFT of the transform of real data, as well as their computational complexities, are presented. A C-language program of one of the proposed algorithms is given, illustrating the use of all the features of the new approach in software implementation. Comparison results are included to show that the proposed algorithms are faster and simpler than the real-valued split-radix and other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/78.611197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13349/00611197.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.611197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13349","startPage":"2010","endPage":"2022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast computation of the discrete Fourier transform of real data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast computation of the discrete Fourier transform of real data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5676611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast computation of the discrete Fourier transform of real data","sourcePdf":"00611197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049591S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","articleId":"611197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":611201,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A development in residue arithmetic is the quadratic residue number system (QRNS), which can perform complex multiplications with only two integer multiplications instead of four. An RNS/QRNS is defined by a set of relatively prime integers, called the moduli set, where the choice of this set is one of the most important design considerations for RNS/QRNS systems. In order to maintain simple QRNS arithmetic, moduli sets with numbers of forms 2/sup n/+1 (n is even) have been considered. An efficient such set is the three-moduli set (2/sup 2k-2/+1.2/sup 2k/+1.2/sup 2k+2/+1) for odd k. However, if large dynamic ranges are desirable, QRNS systems with more than three relatively prime moduli must be considered. It is shown that if a QRNS set consists of more than four relatively prime moduli of forms 2/sup n/+1, the moduli selection process becomes inflexible and the arithmetic gets very unbalanced. The above problem can be solved if nonrelatively prime moduli are used. New multimoduli QRNS systems are presented that are based on nonrelatively prime moduli of forms 2/sup n/+1 (n even). The new systems allow flexible moduli selection process, very balanced arithmetic, and are appropriate for large dynamic ranges. For a given dynamic range, these new systems exhibit better speed performance than that of the three-moduli QRNS system.","doi":"10.1109/78.611213","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13349/00611213.pdf","startPage":"2085","endPage":"2091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.611213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the binary quadratic residue system with noncoprime moduli","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"On the binary quadratic residue system with noncoprime moduli","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5676617","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the binary quadratic residue system with noncoprime moduli","sourcePdf":"00611213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034166S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","articleId":"611213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":611226,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.S.G.

The pipelined cycle of the proposed architecture is merely equivalent to the delay time of a pair of 1-bit comparisons that is independent on the window size and the signal resolution.","doi":"10.1109/78.611236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.611236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13349/00611236.pdf","startPage":"2140","endPage":"2144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"A bit-level pipelined VLSI architecture for the running order algorithm","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5676628","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bit-level pipelined VLSI architecture for the running order algorithm","sourcePdf":"00611236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035567S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","articleId":"611236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611250,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our algorithm features a relatively simple coding structure and provides a better framework for balancing between high compression performance and robustness to channel errors. The fundamental approach is to explicitly classify the encoder's output bit sequence into subsequences, which are then protected differently according to their importance and robustness. Experimental results indicate that, for noisy channels, the proposed algorithm is slightly more resilient to channel errors than more complex and sophisticated source-channel coding algorithms. More important is that our algorithm is substantially more robust with respect to varying channel error conditions. This provides much needed reliability in low-bandwidth wireless applications.","doi":"10.1109/97.611284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/13352/00611284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.611284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"227","endPage":"229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust EZW image coding for noisy channels","volume":"4","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5673431","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust EZW image coding for noisy channels","sourcePdf":"00611284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058975S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"52","articleId":"611284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611287,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

A metamorphic robotic system is a collection of mechatronic modules, each of which has the ability to connect, disconnect, and climb over adjacent modules. We examine the near-optimal reconfiguration of a metamorphic robot from an arbitrary initial configuration to a desired final configuration. Concepts of distance between metamorphic robot configurations are defined, and shown to satisfy the formal properties of a metric. These metrics, called configuration metrics, are then applied to the automatic self-reconfiguration of metamorphic systems in the case when one module is allowed to move at a time. There is no simple method for computing the optimal sequence of moves required to reconfigure. As a result, heuristics which can give a near optimal solution must be used. We use the technique of simulated annealing to drive the reconfiguration process with configuration metrics as cost functions. The relative performance of simulated annealing with different cost functions is compared and the usefulness of the metrics developed in this paper is demonstrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot motion","Motion planning","Connectors","Simulated annealing","Mechatronics","Robotics and automation","Computational modeling","Cost function","Control systems","Morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot dynamics","path planning","simulated annealing","self-adjusting systems","mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular robot","motion planning","dynamic self-reconfiguration","metamorphic systems","mechatronic modules","configuration metrics","heuristics","simulated annealing","cost functions","optimal assignment","self reconfigurable robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611311","doi":"10.1109/70.611311","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/13344/00611311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.611311","startPage":"531","endPage":"545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Useful metrics for modular robot motion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Useful metrics for modular robot motion planning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5662922","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Useful metrics for modular robot motion planning","sourcePdf":"00611311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045595S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"157","articleId":"611311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":611333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We then show how motion perceptibility can be combined with the traditional notion of manipulability, into a composite perceptibility/manipulability measure. We demonstrate how this composite measure may be applied to a number of different problems involving relative hand/eye positioning and control.","doi":"10.1109/70.611333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"607","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.611333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13344","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/13344/00611333.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servosystems","Motion measurement","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Application software","Computer vision","Manipulators","Position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active vision","robot vision","path planning","manipulators","servomechanisms","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion perceptibility","active vision-based servo control","computer vision system","manipulability","composite perceptibility/manipulability measure","relative hand/eye positioning","relative hand/eye control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Motion perceptibility and its application to active vision-based servo control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611333/","volume":"13","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5662929","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion perceptibility and its application to active vision-based servo control","sourcePdf":"00611333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041375S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"52","articleId":"611333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":611335,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

A redundant manipulator is considered to be fault tolerant with respect to a given task if it is guaranteed to be capable of performing the task after any one of its joints has failed and is locked in place. A method is developed for determining the necessary constraints which insure the failure tolerance of a kinematically redundant manipulator with respect to a given critical task. This method is based on estimating the bounding boxes enclosing the self-motion manifolds for a given set of critical task points. The intersection of these bounding boxes provides a set of artificial joint limits that may guarantee the reachability of the task points after a joint failure. An algorithm for dealing with the special case of 2-D self-motion surfaces is presented, These techniques are illustrated on a PUMA 560 that is used for a 3-D Cartesian positioning task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerant operation of kinematically redundant manipulators for locked joint failures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.611335","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/13344/00611335.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.611335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611335/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant operation of kinematically redundant manipulators for locked joint failures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5662931","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant operation of kinematically redundant manipulators for locked joint failures","sourcePdf":"00611335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03844S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"89","articleId":"611335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":611623,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The game Go is an ideal problem domain for exploring machine learning; it has simple rules but requires complex strategies to play well. All current commercial Go programs are knowledge based implementations; they utilize input feature and pattern matching along with minimax type search techniques. But the extremely high branching factor puts a limit on their capabilities, and they are very weak compared to the relative strengths of other game programs like chess. In this paper, the Go-playing ACD consists of a critic network and an action network. The HDP type critic network learns to predict the cumulative utility function of the current board position from training games, and, the action network chooses a next move which maximizes critics next step cost-to-go. After about 6000 different training games against a public domain program, WALLY, the network (playing WHITE) began to win in some of the games and showed slow but steady improvements on test games.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611623","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive critic design in learning to play game of Go","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive critic design in learning to play game of Go","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5678999","volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive critic design in learning to play game of Go","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051327S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"12","articleId":"611623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":611626,"authors":[{"name":"King-Lung Huang","affiliation":["Opto-Electronics and System Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute"],"lastName":"King-Lung Huang","id":"37087378214"},{"name":"Shu-Cheng Hsieh","affiliation":["Opto-Electronics and System Laboratories, Industrial Technology and Research Institute"],"lastName":"Shu-Cheng Hsieh","id":"37087377662"},{"name":"Hsin-Chia Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Chia Fu","id":"37087295893"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4122-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"611626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Printers","Calibration","Application software","Color","Laboratories","Computer industry","Electrical equipment industry","Computer science","Printing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","splines (mathematics)","optical scanners","printers","calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade-CMAC neural network","color scanner","printer calibration","cerebellar model articulation controller","color resolution","learning capacity","Macbeth color-checker"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611626","abstract":"This paper presents an application of using a cascade-CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) neural network to solve some color calibration problems, which include color differences induced from gamuts mis-match and the nonlinear transformation characteristics between color scanning input devices and color printing output devices. For this purpose, we proposed a scalable learning architecture \"cascade-CMAC\" to implement an adaptive color calibration system. By analyzing the preliminary learning situation, the scalable architecture can dynamically create a new learning unit to better represent a finer color resolution, so that the learning capacity as well as the color details of the system can be greatly improved. From the experimental results, the proposed cascade-CMAC architecture can improve the rate of convergence and also can adjust the learning architecture effectively. The learning speed can be 2/spl sim/4 times faster than the conventional CMAC. The effectiveness of this neural network has been tested by observing the differences between the calibrated and the un-calibrated output on a number of known samples. By using the Macbeth color-checker which contains 24 color patches as benchmark, the average color differences between the original and the calibrated print-out is improved from 15 /spl Delta/E/sub ab/ to 8 /spl Delta/E/sub ab/ under the 3 /spl Delta/E/sub ab/ convergent criterion for training. The calibration performance is somewhat significant.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611626","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611626.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"15 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascade-CMAC neural network applications on the color scanner to printer calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Cascade-CMAC neural network applications on the color scanner to printer calibration","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5679001","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascade-CMAC neural network applications on the color scanner to printer calibration","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049029S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"2","articleId":"611626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611630,"authors":[{"name":"P.N.

Experimental results show that the method is at least as accurate as a trained prosthetist.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611641","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611641.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"85 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locating anatomical landmarks for prosthetics design using ensemble neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Locating anatomical landmarks for prosthetics design using ensemble neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5679014","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locating anatomical landmarks for prosthetics design using ensemble neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027287S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"5","articleId":"611641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611648,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Shuhui Li","id":"37087160906"},{"name":"D.C.

Multipath fading is a significant problem in wireless communications systems and may occur whenever there is more than one path from a transmitter to the intended receiver. One method of addressing this task is to implement a RAKE receiver. However, this requires estimates of tap weights based on characteristics of the channel model. Within limited environments the multipath characteristics of a channel may exhibit little variation over time. Under these conditions a neural network can be employed to learn the tap weights.

From the fault location equations, similar to the conventional approach, this method selects phasors of prefault and superimposed voltages and currents from all phases of the transmission line as inputs of the artificial neural network. The outputs of the neural network are the fault position and the fault resistance. With its function approximation ability, the neural network is trained to map the nonlinear relationship existing in the fault location equations with the distributed parameter line model. It can get both fast speed and high accuracy. The influence of the remote-end infeed on neural network structure is studied. A comparison with the conventional method has been done. It is shown that the neural network-based method can adapt itself to big variations of source impedances at the remote terminal. Finally, when the remote source impedances vary in small ranges, the structure of artificial neural network has been optimized by the pruning method.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611657","startPage":"163","endPage":"168 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611657.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial neural network based real-time fault locator for transmission lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Transmission lines","Fault location","Power transmission lines","Nonlinear equations","Power system protection","Voltage","Impedance","Frequency","Current transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","power transmission lines","neural net architecture","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","distributed parameter systems","function approximation","backpropagation","power engineering computing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based real-time fault locator","transmission lines","single-ended fault location","fault position","fault resistance","function approximation ability","nonlinear relationship","distributed parameter line model","remote-end infeed","neural network structure","source impedances","pruning method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"An artificial neural network based real-time fault locator for transmission lines","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5679028","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial neural network based real-time fault locator for transmission lines","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052328S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"611657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611658,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These particles can cause surface defects which lead to reduced yield. While 100% inspection of processed wafers during fabrication provides the most accurate means for detecting these anomalies, it is also very time-consuming and costly. This cost can be mitigated through the use of automated in-situ particle monitoring systems (ISPMs) which provided real-time estimates of particle counts in process chambers for different categories of particle sizes. However, the challenge is to correlate ISPM measurements with actual surface defects. In this paper, neural network models are used to estimate the number of particles that are deposited on a semiconductor wafer based on ISPM data collected during processing in a reactive ion etching (RIE) chamber. This particle prediction methodology can lead to reduced resting costs and more accurate defect detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611658","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611658.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"173 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect prediction for reactive ion etching using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Defect prediction for reactive ion etching using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5679029","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect prediction for reactive ion etching using neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038302S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"611658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":611663,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This article presents a design methodology that enables the insertion of pre-trained parts in a MLP network topology and illustrates the advantages of such a modular approach. Furthermore we will discuss the differences between the modular approach and a hybrid approach, where explicit knowledge is captured by mathematical models. In a hybrid design a mathematical model is embedded in the modular neural network as an optimization of one of the pre-trained subnetworks or because the designer wants to obtain a certain degree of transparency of captured knowledge in the modular design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611670/","accessionNumber":"5679041","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Assembling engineering knowledge in a modular multi-layer perceptron neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assembling engineering knowledge in a modular multi-layer perceptron neural network","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050774S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"7","articleId":"611670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":611671,"authors":[{"name":"M.

During the processing of a given data set, the fuzzy SART orienting subsystem: 1) adds a new neuron to the attentional subsystem whenever the system fails to recognize an input pattern; and 2) removes a previously allocated neuron from the attentional subsystem if the neuron is no longer able to categorize any input pattern. The performance of fuzzy SART is compared with that of the CGR fuzzy ART model when a 2D data set and the 4D IRIS data set are processed.

We mathematically model the cell immunization in terms of weight vector relocation and propose a polynomial time weight relocating algorithm. This algorithm can be generalized to the case where each neuron separating the input vectors into more than two classes.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611683","startPage":"302","endPage":"307 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611683.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault immunization technique for artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Circuit faults","Immune system","Neurons","Fault tolerance","Computer network reliability","Computer science","Biological system modeling","Mathematics","Chemicals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceptrons","minimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault immunization technique","artificial neural networks","fault tolerance","perceptron-like neuron","cell immunization","weight vector relocation","polynomial time weight relocating algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fault immunization technique for artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5679054","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault immunization technique for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062011S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"3","articleId":"611683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":611704,"authors":[{"name":"Chu Kwong Chak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"lastName":"Chu Kwong Chak","id":"37087152665"},{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"lastName":"Gang Feng","id":"37087152770"},{"name":"M.

This paper introduces a co-evolutionary algorithm (CEA) based on the concept of divide and conquer. The basic idea is to divide the system into many small homogeneous modules, define an individual as a module, find many good individuals using existing EAs, and put them together again to form the whole system. To make the study more concrete, we focus the discussion on the evolutionary learning of neural networks for pattern recognition. Experimental results are provided to show the procedure and the performance of the CEA.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611707","startPage":"432","endPage":"437 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611707.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A co-evolutionary algorithm for neural network learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611707/","displayDocTitle":"A co-evolutionary algorithm for neural network learning","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5679078","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A co-evolutionary algorithm for neural network learning","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030109S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"6","articleId":"611707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611708,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the most probable explanation (MPE) problem, also known as the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) assignment problem, the objective is to assign truth values to network variables in a way that will maximize their joint probability conditioned on the evidence to be explained. This problem has recently been shown to be NP-hard for general belief networks and for large networks, exact solution methods are not practical. In this paper, we present a parallel processing technique, particularly suitable for loosely-coupled multicomputers which combines genetic algorithms with simulated annealing.

Widespread application of fuzzy logic can be significantly enhanced by robust and reliable methods for generating fuzzy logic rules from training data. Fuzzy logic learning must satisfy the principles of learning defined by neural net learning theory. The fundamental design and training issues for both fuzzy logic and neural net systems should be the same. These principles require the algorithm not only to design and train the net in polynomial time, but also to make an explicit attempt to generate the smallest possible net, which implies attempting to generate the smallest set of fuzzy rules to describe the phenomenon. That is, it implies making an explicit attempt to generalize. Generalization and polynomial time complexity are aspects of learning not often mentioned in the fuzzy logic literature. This paper is also an attempt to integrate and unify fuzzy logic and neural network architectures and learning. Since both fuzzy logic and neural networks arise from the same learning experience of humans, they must reside in the same computational structure in the human brain, not in different ones. One of the fundamental ideas of fuzzy systems is to better understand and explain complex decisions in natural, linguistic terms. It is shown here that this can be done using standard neural network architectures such as RBF nets.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.611723","startPage":"522","endPage":"527 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13361/00611723.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.611723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and brain-like learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Biological neural networks","Polynomials","Computer architecture","Humans","Robustness","Training data","Algorithm design and analysis","Fuzzy sets","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","computational complexity","generalisation (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","neural network architectures","brain-like learning","training data","fuzzy rules","generalization","polynomial time complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and brain-like learning","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5679094","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic, neural networks, and brain-like learning","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00611723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035178S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"4","articleId":"611723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":611725,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As such, it is often present in plants for which controllers are being designed, where it introduces a problematic nonlinear multivalued behavior. Continuing research into nonlinear systems is generating an increasing interest in the control of hysteretic plants. Herein, there is a broad twofold focus: to obtain general and tractable models of hysteresis capable of accurately describing a variety of hysteretic phenomena, and then to derive corresponding control designs and supporting analytical results. This paper presents mathematical definitions and illustrative descriptions of four general hysteresis models: the hysteron, Bouc-Wen, Chua-Stromsmoe and Preisach models. Each model is capable of representing a great many forms of hysteretic behavior, and is also mathematically tractable enough for control design. As an example, the Bouc-Wen model is used to develop a semi-active structural control model for a magnetorheological damper attached to a three-story scaled building.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611746/","accessionNumber":"6015714","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Models for hysteresis and application to structural control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models for hysteresis and application to structural control","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00611746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031017S","chronDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4827","citationCount":"28","articleId":"611746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":611749,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Yi-Liang Chen","id":"37087222098"},{"name":"G.

The control scheme is implemented using a CMAC neural network, trained with a modified LMS algorithm. This algorithm uses a varying learning rate function (LRF) which is defined as a function of the rotor angle of the motor under control. Experimental measurements of the static torque production of a 4 kW, four-phase SRM form the basis of simulation studies of this approach. The simulation results demonstrate that a learned current profile, capable of minimising torque ripple while having high power efficiency, can be obtained by selecting a LRF with suitable turn-on and turn-off angles during the training of the network.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.611793","startPage":"237","endPage":"241 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

Data for building neural network models are resampled using the bootstrap re-sampling technique to form several sets of training data. For each set of training data, a neural network model is developed. Predictions from individual networks are combined to form the final model prediction in order to improve model accuracy and robustness. A further benefit of bootstrap aggregated neural network is that confidence bounds for model predictions can be formulated. Stacked neural networks are used to build an inverse model of the reactor. The amounts of impurities and fouling can be worked out by comparing the predicted effective initial reaction conditions with the nominal initial conditions. The proposed techniques have been successfully applied to a pilot scale batch methyl methacrylate polymerisation reactor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611795/","accessionNumber":"6010499","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of impurity and fouling in batch polymerisation reactors using stacked neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of impurity and fouling in batch polymerisation reactors using stacked neural networks","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00611795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040744S","chronDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4827","citationCount":"3","articleId":"611795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":611797,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Certain engine parameters are already measured by existing measurement sensors. Other parameters necessary or desirable for intelligent engine monitoring or control are not currently measured, either because those measurements would be too costly or too slow to be of use in real time. The approach is to use the suite of available sensor measurements along with neural networks with online learning capabilities to develop \"virtual sensors\" for the parameters that are needed but cannot be easily or rapidly measured. The data from these virtual sensors can then be used for performance monitoring and to make intelligent engine control decisions. A general aviation (GA) aircraft engine was used for data collection for this phase of the project. Three virtual sensors were developed in this project. These virtual sensors estimate parameters for pilot aid, diagnostics, and emission monitoring. High quality outputs were obtained for all parameters for normal operating conditions. The estimation errors ranged from /spl plusmn/3% to /spl plusmn/6%. This level of accuracy demonstrates feasibility of the virtual sensor concept for this application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/611885/","accessionNumber":"6015814","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Virtual sensors for spark ignition engines using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual sensors for spark ignition engines using neural networks","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00611885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052875S","chronDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4827","citationCount":"14","articleId":"611885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":611886,"authors":[{"name":"Yingxu Yang","affiliation":["Research Center of Automation, Notheilstern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yingxu Yang","id":"37087634765"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["Research Center of Automation, Notheilstern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Tianyou Chai","id":"37087164937"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3832-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1619"}],"articleNumber":"611886","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=611886","abstract":"Soft sensing or inferential estimation has long been considered a potent tool to deal with the conflict between small control interval and large sampling interval existing in a wide variety of industrial processes.

The strategy is based on splitting the power demand between the engine and the battery such that these power sources are operated at high efficiency. The power demand is estimated as the output of a high gain PI controller that controls the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle. The focus was to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle by suitable power assignment to the power sources. This power split (assignment) is implemented under a rule-base frame. The rules depend on the values of selected variables: the power demand itself, the driver's acceleration command and the status of the SOC (state of charge) of the battery. The rules ensure that the engine and the battery operate at high efficiency whenever possible. At high power demand the engine will operate at its maximum rated power. Simulation results of the proposed strategy showed improvement in fuel economy over the \"thermostat\" strategy. An improvement of 11% in the urban cycle and of 6% in the highway cycle have been achieved for a series hybrid vehicle driven by a 40 KW diesel engine and a 60 kW lead acid battery.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Batteries","Fuel economy","Internal combustion engines","Diesel engines","Power demand","Vehicle driving","Wheels","Pi control","Proportional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","intelligent control","acceleration control","power control","nonlinear control systems","linear systems","two-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule-based energy management strategy","series hybrid vehicle","rule-based control","power demand","high gain PI controller","longitudinal acceleration","fuel economy","power assignment","power sources","driver's acceleration command","urban cycle","highway cycle","40 KW diesel engine","60 kW lead acid battery","40 kW","60 kW"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1997.611889","startPage":"689","endPage":"693 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

The state feedback control law is explicitly constructed by using a Lyapunov-based recursive design procedure, i.e., the backstepping method. In the case when d(t) represents an unknown constant vector parameter and appears linearly in the nonlinear system, an adaptive controller is also developed, achieving global stability with state regulation.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1997.611922","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 American Control Conference (Cat.

However their practical use is limited due to the huge number of coefficients that need to be estimated even for simple SISO systems. Orthonormal basis functions, like distorted sine functions and Laguerre functions, have been proposed as a means to reduce the number of parameters. In linear system identification generalized orthonormal basis functions have been widely used to reduce the number of parameters one needs to estimate with very promising results. In this paper, we extend the use of generalized orthonormal basis functions to cover the nonlinear system identification and discuss the merits of such use. Finally, we give two examples on which we implement the proposed method, a CSTR system (SISO case) and a model IV fluid catalytic cracking unit (MIMO case).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"6016940","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear dynamical system identification using reduced Volterra models with generalised orthonormal basis functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear dynamical system identification using reduced Volterra models with generalised orthonormal basis functions","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00612016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058772S","chronDate":"4-6 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4827","citationCount":"9","articleId":"612016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":612027,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

An important example is the use of neural network pattern generators for the control of locomotion.

In the author's work, he is using neural networks to control locomotion and posture in individuals with spinal cord injury using functional neuromuscular stimulation.

Spreadsheets, CAD tools, and games, for instance, typically feature floating-point-intensive code. Over the past few years, the leading architectures have incorporated several generations of floating-point units (FPUs). However, while addition and multiplication implementations have become increasingly efficient, support for division and square root has remained uneven. The design community has reached no consensus on the type of algorithm to use for these two functions, and quality and performance of the implementations vary widely. This situation originates in skepticism about the importance of division and square root and an insufficient understanding of the design alternatives. Quantifying what constitutes good performance is challenging. One rule thumb, for example, states that the latency of division should be three times that of multiplication; this figure is based on division frequencies in a selection of typical scientific applications. Even if we accept this doctrine at face value, implementing division-and square root-involves much more than relative latencies. We must also consider area, throughput, complexity, and the interaction with other operations. This article explores the various trade-offs involved and illuminates the consequences of different design choices, thus enabling designers to make informed decisions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5680357","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Division and square root: choosing the right implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Division and square root: choosing the right implementation","sourcePdf":"00612224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034969S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"45","articleId":"612224","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":612229,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

However, several projects have shown that the Internet can also be the locus for large scale collaboration. In these projects, contributors from around the world combine their individual forces and develop a product that rivals those of multibillion dollar corporations. The Apache HTTP Server Project is a case in point. This collaborative software development effort has created a robust, feature-rich HTTP server software package that currently dominates the public Internet market (46 percent compared with 16 percent for Microsoft and 12 percent for Netscape, according to a June 1997 survey published by Netcraft). The software and its source code are free, but Apache's popularity is more often attributed to performance than price. The project is managed by the Apache Group, a geographically distributed group of volunteers who use the Internet and Web to communicate, develop, and distribute the server and its related documentation. In addition, hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the project.","doi":"10.1109/4236.612229","pdfPath":"/iel1/4236/13381/00612229.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"90","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4236.612229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Apache HTTP Server Project","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"The Apache HTTP Server Project","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5700284","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Apache HTTP Server Project","sourcePdf":"00612229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02894S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"31","articleId":"612229","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":612244,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The processors may collaborate on a parallel job or run independent tasks (as in the SMT proposal). The CMP architecture lends itself to simpler design, faster validation, cleaner functional partitioning, and higher theoretical peak performance.

Instead, programs are compiled directly onto the Raw hardware, with all units told explicitly what to do by the compiler. The compiler even schedules most of the intertile communication. The real limitation to this architecture is the efficacy of the compiler. The authors demonstrate impressive speedups for simple algorithms that lend themselves well to this architectural model, but whether this architecture will be effective for future workloads is an open question.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.612254","doi":"10.1109/2.612254","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/13382/00612254.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"Computer","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Baring it all to software: Raw machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Baring it all to software: Raw machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5699446","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Baring it all to software: Raw machines","sourcePdf":"00612254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045831S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"328","articleId":"612254","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":612272,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In third-generation systems, the influence of mobility on the network performance (e.g., handover rate) will be strengthened, mainly due to the huge number of mobile users in conjunction with the small cell size. In particular, the accuracy of mobility models becomes essential for the evaluation of system design alternatives and network implementation cost issues. The authors propose three basic types of mobility models, which are appropriate for the analysis of the full range of mobile communications design issues. The models provide different levels of detail regarding the user mobility behavior. In particular, (a) the city area model traces user motion at an area zone level, (b) the area zone model considers users moving on a street network, and (c) the street unit model tracks user motion with an accuracy of a few meters. The validity of the basic models for mobile communications design aspects is highlighted. Moreover, an \"integrated mobility modeling tool\" which considers the basic mobility models as components is proposed, aiming at the development of a refined modeling approach. This is achieved by improving the accuracy of the input parameters of each basic model via the exchange of some specific (mobility-related) parameters among the component models. To justify the applicability of the proposed integrated tool for both the analysis of design aspects and network planning, indicative results are presented, derived from simulation-based application examples of the three basic mobility models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612276/","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5699229","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobility modeling in third-generation mobile telecommunications systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility modeling in third-generation mobile telecommunications systems","sourcePdf":"00612276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107799S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"113","articleId":"612276","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":612372,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The first ANN, chosen as reference, is the popular multi-layer perceptron (MLP) equipped with taped-delay lines. The second pertains to the family of feedforward neural networks with first-order filters added locally to the neurons, while the third is recurrent in the usual sense, with an architecture that mimics a nonlinear discrete state-space system. In contrast with the MLP, the two latter ANNs theoretically allow system dynamics to be identified without having to feed past inputs and outputs explicitly. Based on realistic data obtained by simulating a line fault with a sample hydro-generator connected to an infinite bus, it is shown that all ANNs can successfully identify a three-input four-output model of the underlying electromechanical process. However, their performance varies widely, according to their numerical complexity, convergence characteristics and accuracy in predicting the system behavior for new inputs not seen during training.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612372/","accessionNumber":"5723349","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons of artificial neural networks for on-line identification of a nonlinear multivariate electromechanical process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons of artificial neural networks for on-line identification of a nonlinear multivariate electromechanical process","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00612372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056817S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4799","articleId":"612372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":612373,"authors":[{"name":"X.Z.

The meter employs absorption techniques, non-destructive and can easily be adapted for on-line measurements. The samples are placed in fixed size containers in 700-900 gr batches. The microwave energy absorption by the samples at certain frequencies is found to be proportional to moisture contents. The previous information about the microwave moisture properties of the dried fruits are stored in a microcontroller. The microcontroller interfaced to the system records the amount of absorption and indicates the moisture levels, after having compared with the stored information and taking the weights, grain sizes and the types of dried fruit samples into account. By this method an accuracy of 2-3% has been achieved. The device is consistent in readings, and is reliable and cost effective.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1997.612400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference Sensing, Processing, Networking.

We have developed a highly functional logic gate, called MOBILE (monostable-bistable transition logic element), which exploits the negative differential resistance (NDR) of the RT phenomenon. In this paper, we demonstrate the high-speed operation-up to 18 Gb/s-of the MOBILE flip-flop (FF) circuit at room temperature. The present result indicates the promise of MOBILE-based FF circuits for high-speed digital applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612488/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5723912","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High-speed operation of a resonant tunneling flip-flop circuit employing a MOBILE (monostable-bistable transition logic element)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed operation of a resonant tunneling flip-flop circuit employing a MOBILE (monostable-bistable transition logic element)","confLoc":"Fort Collins, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00612488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085734S","chronDate":"23-25 June 1997","isNumber":"13389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4839","citationCount":"8","articleId":"612488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":612513,"authors":[{"name":"N.

These methods have broad application to hardware, software, and system design. Design based on mathematical logic offers the capability to relate structural descriptions with behavioral descriptions and properties. The challenge is to move these methods into mainstream engineering. This requires teaching mathematical logic in engineering courses which are directly applicable to engineering design.

In this approach, the filter structure is composed of a periodic model filter, its complementary periodic filter, and two masking filters. Earlier, this structure has been used for FIR filters in order to reduce the arithmetic complexity. Here, two allpass filters in parallel are used for the model filter, whereas linear-phase FIR filters are used for the masking filters. The allpass filters are functions of z/sup M/ resulting in filter algorithms with high maximal sample frequencies. By realizing the allpass filters as a cascade of low-order sections, it is possible to obtain highly modular and parallel filter algorithms, which is advantageous from an implementation point of view. Further, by using wave digital filters for the allpass filters, it is possible to maintain stability under finite-arithmetic conditions. Using the new approach, it is possible to increase the maximal sample frequency to an arbitrary level, for arbitrary bandwidths.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Frequency","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","Arithmetic","Bandwidth","Periodic structures","Digital filters","Energy consumption","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive filters","filtering theory","all-pass filters","delay circuits","FIR filters","cascade networks","wave digital filters","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed recursive filtering","frequency-response masking","periodic model filter","complementary periodic filter","masking filter","all-pass filter","linear-phase FIR filter","cascade","modular parallel algorithm","wave digital filter","finite arithmetic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.612759","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13390/00612759.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2211 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.612759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed recursive filtering using the frequency-response masking approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=612759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-speed recursive filtering using the frequency-response masking approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612759/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5752235","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed recursive filtering using the frequency-response masking approach","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00612759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085458S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"13","articleId":"612759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":612764,"authors":[{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Soo-Chang Pei","id":"37086968340"},{"name":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chien-Cheng Tseng","id":"37087163224"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3583-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"612764","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"abstract":"In this paper, a new comb filter design method using fractional sample delay is presented.

Various well known multiplier architectures are compared and an appropriate structure for FPGA implementation is identified. The high data throughput required to accommodate the input sample values is achieved using an interleaved memory structure. To provide flexibility, a generic VHDL filter model has been developed which allows the automatic synthesis from specification down to FPGA realisation. The model operates on 2's complement numbers and is characterised by three user defined parameters: number of filter taps, signal and coefficient wordlengths. To demonstrate the design process, the implementation of a 64 tap linear phase filter with 60 dB attenuation at 0.28 fs, 12 dB attenuation at 0.25 fs and a passband ripple of /spl plusmn/0.01 dB up to 0.22 fs is included.

This proposed algorithm (1) self-generates coarse estimates of the sources' arrival angles to start off its MUSIC-based iterative search without any a priori source parametric information, (2) exploits information embedded in the impinging sonar velocity-field (as versus pressure field), (3) automatically pairs the x-axis direction-cosine estimates with the y-axis direction-cosine estimates. This method uses vector-hydrophones, each of which comprises three spatially co-located but orthogonally oriented velocity-hydrophones. Each velocity-hydrophone distinctly measures one Cartesian component the incident sonar wavefield's velocity-vector. Velocity-hydrophone technology is well established in underwater acoustics and a great variety of commercial models have long been available. This proposed algorithm forms velocity-field beams at each vector-hydrophone, and uses coarse estimates of each source's velocity-vector estimate obtained by decoupling the signal-subspace eigenvectors. Simulation results verify this innovative scheme's capability to self-generate initial direction-cosine estimates for its MUSIC-based iterative search and demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance relative to a similarly spaced army of pressure-hydrophones. Under one scenario, the proposed method lowers the estimation bias by 95% and the estimation standard deviation by 47%, relative to a similarly configured array of pressure-hydrophones provided with a priori initial arrival angle estimates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5760327","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"Self-initiating velocity-field beamspace MUSIC for underwater acoustic direction-finding with irregularly spaced vector-hydrophones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-initiating velocity-field beamspace MUSIC for underwater acoustic direction-finding with irregularly spaced vector-hydrophones","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00612845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045707S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"12","articleId":"612845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":612847,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Academia Sinica, China"],"lastName":"Chao Xu","id":"37614935500"},{"name":"Zhenming Chai","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Academia Sinica, China"],"lastName":"Zhenming Chai","id":"37609267700"},{"name":"Shiwei Shu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Academia Sinica, China"],"lastName":"Shiwei Shu","id":"37621022100"},{"name":"Minhui Zhu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Academia Sinica, China"],"lastName":"Minhui Zhu","id":"37404532100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3583-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"612847","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Time frequency analysis","Matched filters","Synthetic aperture radar","Spaceborne radar","Motion analysis","Signal analysis","Azimuth","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","radar detection","radar imaging","wavelet transforms","time-frequency analysis","matched filters","radar clutter","Wigner distribution","radar signal processing","interference suppression","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR detection","moving targets","approximate wavelet transform","time-frequency analysis","combinational technique","matched filtering","inverse process","background clutter suppression","Wigner-Ville distribution","noise suppression"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a combinational technique of approximate wavelet transform and time-frequency analysis for detection of moving targets in SAR signals.

With regular sampling, the size of each shift (step size) for computing an auto-correlation of a sequence is necessarily the same as the sampling period. When random sampling is adopted, there is no such natural choice and the step size must be determined according to other criteria. This paper suggests to choose a step size that can accommodate the highest frequency component of interest contained in a sequence. The techniques developed for solving the problems in finding overlaps and speeding up computation are described. Although the discussion is confined to circular auto-correlation, the computation techniques proposed can apply equally well to cross-correlation and convolution of randomly sampled sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Sampling methods","Signal sampling","Power engineering computing","Frequency domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Data engineering","Power engineering and energy","Digital signal processing","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","sequences","correlation methods","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["randomly sampled sequences","circular auto-correlation","power density spectrum","data sequence","digital signal processing","step size","pseudo-continuity","Nyquist limit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.612871","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13390/00612871.pdf","startPage":"2657","endPage":"2660 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.612871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing circular auto-correlation of randomly sampled sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=612871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computing circular auto-correlation of randomly sampled sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612871/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5752345","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing circular auto-correlation of randomly sampled sequences","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00612871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050275S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","articleId":"612871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":612876,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Comparisons with \"turbo codes\" and with serially concatenated codes show that the hybrid scheme offers better performance at very low BER.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.612925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.612925","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00612925.pdf","startPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid concatenated codes and iterative decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid concatenated codes and iterative decoding","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5827996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612925/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid concatenated codes and iterative decoding","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00612925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032794S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"25","articleId":"612925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":612942,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

This is natural for circularly symmetric densities such as IID Gaussian. A number of polar schemes have been proposed, analyzed and optimized. One of the best is unrestricted polar quantization (UPQ), in which the phase step size depends on the quantized magnitude. Prior analysis has shown that when optimized, its SNR is only 0.17 dB less than optimal 2-dimensional VQ. We show that UPQ can be very simply analyzed and optimized using the VQ version of Bennett's integral. Indeed, it is shown that one may optimize UPQ based solely on the criteria that it have the point density of an optimal VQ, and square rather than hexagonal cells. We also analyze and optimize power law polar quantization, in which the number of phase levels is proportional to a power of the quantized magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.612975","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00612975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.612975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","startPage":"60","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar quantization revisited","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=612975","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polar quantization revisited","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612975/","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5828046","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar quantization revisited","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00612975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033311S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"16","articleId":"612975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":612990,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The detector is simple in structure, consisting of a whitened matched filter and two variable thresholds for each symbol to be detected. The detector will make decisions on some, but most often not all, of the symbols in a transmitted sequence, and those decisions will be the same decisions as the maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) would have made. The number of symbols that are detected is stochastic, varying from sequence to sequence. The basis of the detector is a bound on a cross-product of the quadratic form in the log-likelihood function for the transmitted sequence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/612990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5828061","displayDocTitle":"Making MLSD-decisions on some individual symbols thresholding the matched filter output","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making MLSD-decisions on some individual symbols thresholding the matched filter output","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00612990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055198S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"2","articleId":"612990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":612997,"authors":[{"name":"O.

There is great interest in coding systems that employ various kinds of code concatenation. In all of these schemes, an important element in the decoder is the MAP decoder, a device that puts out the probability of trellis states or data bits, rather than simply the most likely state or bit. For trellis encoding and Markov data, the MAP decoder is a special scheme, the BCJR algorithm. Unfortunately, the BCJR algorithm is computationally intensive. The purpose of this paper is to present a strong simplification of it that does not sacrifice the decoder error performance. Our algorithms exploit the fact that most working probabilities in the BCJR algorithm are very small, and with a little care can be ignored without losing performance. We find that the most successful strategy is to ignore working probabilities that fall below a certain threshold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 1997-July 4 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5842005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-search BCJR algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-search BCJR algorithms","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00613145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060414S","chronDate":"June 29 1997-July 4 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"4","articleId":"613145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":613155,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.M.

The area has become highly topical because of the use of CDMA in current and proposed cellular personal communications systems, such as IS-95. Verdu (1986) introduced maximum-likelihood multi-user detection, and showed that it is able to enhance the capacity of CDMA systems. However, since it is computationally infeasible in practical situations, a number of reduced complexity techniques have been developed. One such technique (also due to Verdu) which has attracted considerable attention because of its relatively low complexity, is linear signal separation, or decorrelation. The cost of eliminating multi-user interference in linear signal separation is an enhancement of thermal noise and external interference. This increases rapidly as the number of signals to be separated approaches the number of degrees of freedom of the signals, which is equal to the number of sequence \"chips\" per channel symbol, after coding. Hence as code rate decreases, noise enhancement increases, setting a limit on the number of users possible and effectively preventing the use of low rate codes. In this paper we consider jointly signal separation and coding, and in particular the trade-off between the techniques: the effect of varying code rate for constant bandwidth efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.613287","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00613287.pdf","startPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.613287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of linear separation of CDMA signals with FEC coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Performance of linear separation of CDMA signals with FEC coding","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5848833","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of linear separation of CDMA signals with FEC coding","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00613287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168743S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"2","articleId":"613287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":613288,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We have two basic goals: (i) To characterize the best possible performance obtainable using multiuser detection. To this end, we consider the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver, which assumes knowledge of the timing and complex amplitudes for all users, and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), which requires knowledge only of the timing for all users. Both receivers have complexity exponential in the number of users. (ii) To obtain low-complexity multiuser detectors that outperform the conventional single user detector (which ignores the presence of the multiple-access interference).

The system uses a version of the slotted ALOHA protocol. An adaptive linear, minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) receiver implemented by a modified least-mean squares (LMS) algorithm is used in the system. The modifications to the adaptive LMMSE receiver overcome the well-known limitations of slow convergence and allow it to operate efficiently over fast fading channels. The modifications to the basic LMS algorithm are outlined and the performance of a system with multiple traffic types is investigated. Traffic types are distinguished by data rates and bit error-rate requirements. The performance of a single cell system with various number of users of each traffic type is investigated. The performance of the total system is calculated from the maximum number of users of each traffic type which the system can support and the total system throughput. The effect of limited power control of the user's signals is also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.613293","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00613293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.613293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","startPage":"358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple traffic type CDMA systems using an improved adaptive LMMSE receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=613293","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple traffic type CDMA systems using an improved adaptive LMMSE receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613293/","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5842074","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple traffic type CDMA systems using an improved adaptive LMMSE receiver","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00613293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021629S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"3","articleId":"613293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":613298,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Given a signal set or codebook C={x/sub 0/,x/sub 1/,...,x/sub M-1/}, the conditional error probability P(e|x/sub 0/) is upper bounded by a sum of pairwise error probabilities (PEP). Here we consider the additive white Gaussian channel, where C is a discrete and finite set of points in the N-dimensional real Euclidean space. In this case, the PEPs are the probabilities of the noise taking a signal on the other side of the hyperplane bounding the decision regions of x/sub 0/ and x/sub i/. An important step toward the reduction of the union bound to its minimal form was made by Verdu, who derived a theorem, commonly referred to as the Verdu-Shields theorem showing how terms can be removed from the upper bound to error probability in the case of binary antipodal transmission over the Gaussian channel with intersymbol interference. In this paper we derive a generalization of the Verdu-Shields theorem which provides a sufficient condition for expurgating a given error sequence x/sub k/ from the union bound.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.613310","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00613310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.613310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","startPage":"373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expurgating the union bound to error probability: a generalization of the Verdu-Shields theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=613310","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Expurgating the union bound to error probability: a generalization of the Verdu-Shields theorem","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613310/","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5848837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expurgating the union bound to error probability: a generalization of the Verdu-Shields theorem","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00613310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029256S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"10","articleId":"613310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":613311,"authors":[{"name":"Long Duan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Long Duan","id":"37366491100"},{"name":"B.

On the one hand, there is an old result saying that the capacity of the channel (under a power constraint but no bandwidth constraint) is the same as the infinite bandwidth capacity of the non-fading additive noise channel with the same average received power as the fading channel. On the other hand, it appears intuitively that when a CDMA system is spread too widely in bandwidth, it becomes increasingly difficult for a RAKE receiver to measure the channel and correspondingly difficult for detection to take place. Here the authors look at a particularly simple model of the fading channel, but the methodology appears to be extendable to more general models.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1997.613408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1997.613408","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4845/13396/00613408.pdf","startPage":"471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth scaling for fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth scaling for fading channels","conferenceDate":"29 June-4 July 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855198","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth scaling for fading channels","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00613408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018189S","chronDate":"29 Jun-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4845","citationCount":"16","articleId":"613408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":613415,"authors":[{"name":"K.V.

An upper bound on the running time of the sequential decoding algorithm is established, and found to resemble the Pareto distribution. Our bound indicates that the order of label groups in T plays an important role in determining the complexity of sequential decoding.

This paper introduces new features based on a combination of fourth- and second-order temporal cyclic cumulants. Such a combination enhances the theoretical discrimination that can be achieved by a single stationary cumulant, and moreover, the cyclic parameters become discriminating whereas it is not the case when they are considered at pure orders. As an application, we propose a process to classify 4-PSK vs. 16-QAM modulations. The classification is achieved by estimating the feature for the received signal, and comparing it with theoretical ones by a matched filter technique. Simulations show that though the cyclic parameters are a priori more discriminating than their stationary counterparts, the variance of their estimates may overcome this advantage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of linear modulations by a combination of different orders cyclic cumulants","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","doi":"10.1109/HOST.1997.613485","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel3/4844/13395/00613485.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1997.613485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=613485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Classification of linear modulations by a combination of different orders cyclic cumulants","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800880","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of linear modulations by a combination of different orders cyclic cumulants","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00613485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028448S","chronDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4844","citationCount":"22","articleId":"613485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":613487,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The adopted speech recognition system consists of four modules, namely, a preprocessor, endpoints' detector, feature extractor and classifier. The first method estimates the AR parameters of speech based on the third- and fourth-order cumulants using high-order Yule-Walker, W-slice and 1-D slice approaches. In the second, method, statistical features are extracted from the estimated high-order probability density function (pdf) of thresholded amplitude features. For each pdf estimate, the values of mean, variance, third order moment and entropy are computed. The total number of features for each frame of approximate length of 15 ms is 16. The adopted TDNN has 16 nodes in its input layer, 10 nodes in its output layer and two hidden layers. The learning rule of the adopted TDNN that is based on the backpropagation rule has been modified to decrease the training time. Computer simulation results obtained from recognizing 10 Farsi digits spoken by different speakers shows that the first method has a better recognition rate while the second method necessitates less computation.","doi":"10.1109/HOST.1997.613487","pdfPath":"/iel3/4844/13395/00613487.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1997.613487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolated word recognition using high-order statistics and time-delay neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Isolated word recognition using high-order statistics and time-delay neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5800882","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated word recognition using high-order statistics and time-delay neural networks","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00613487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04622S","chronDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4844","citationCount":"2","articleId":"613487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":613488,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Averaged over three COST-207 propagation environments, EVI leads to a mean SNR loss of 1.2 dB only, while it saves the 22% overhead in the GSM data rate due to the transmission of training sequences. Since just 142 samples are used for channel estimation, we consider this performance outstanding for an approach based on HOS.","doi":"10.1109/HOST.1997.613488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13395","startPage":"62","endPage":"66","pdfPath":"/iel3/4844/13395/00613488.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1997.613488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of blind versus non-blind channel estimation on the BER performance of GSM receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Bit error rate","GSM","Demodulation","Finite impulse response filter","Viterbi algorithm","Mathematical model","Baseband","Delay","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","nonblind channel estimation","BER performance","GSM receivers","HOS","eigenvector approach to blind identification","nonblind cross-correlation-based scheme","COST-207 mobile radio channels","bit error rates","Viterbi detection","signal-to-noise ratio","propagation environments","EVI","loss","training sequences","higher order statistics","1.2 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Impact of blind versus non-blind channel estimation on the BER performance of GSM receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613488/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5800883","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of blind versus non-blind channel estimation on the BER performance of GSM receivers","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00613488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029715S","chronDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4844","citationCount":"11","articleId":"613488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":613497,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Hsin Li","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Ta-Hsin Li","id":"37293054300"},{"name":"Ke-Shin Lii","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ke-Shin Lii","id":"37063291100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-8005-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"613497","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"A method is proposed for the restoration of linearly blurred two-tone images without requiring the knowledge of the blur parameters.

Each observation contains a mixture of two signals with noise. The objective is to estimate the frequency spectra of the linear filters that combine the two signals in the data stream. The main characteristic of the method is to take into account additive noises. No hypotheses on their probability densities are made. We derive for that an original objective function, based on nonlinear functions of the observations. Specific properties of these functions, chosen as exponential functions, and the hypothesis of independent sources lead to a direct solution for the estimation of the filters. An analytic solution may be computed from it, using only the data. The convergence speed of the method and its robustness against non gaussian noise are illustrated in the paper with simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1997.613539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13395","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel3/4844/13395/00613539.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation with noisy sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation with noisy sources","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5794174","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation with noisy sources","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00613539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042348S","chronDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4844","articleId":"613539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":613548,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, in many situations of practical interest, the received sources are (quasi)-cyclostationary (digital radiocommunications) and are not always statistically independent but may be correlated to each other, which occurs in particular for HF links or in mobile radiocommunications contexts where propagation multipaths are omnipresent. In such situations, the behaviour of the classical HO blind source separation methods is not known, which may be a limitation to the use of these methods in operational contexts. The purpose of this paper is precisely to fill the gap previously mentioned by analysing the behaviour, in radiocommunications contexts, of three classical HO blind source separation methods when several potentially correlated paths of each source, assumed (quasi)-cyclostationary, are received by the array.","doi":"10.1109/HOST.1997.613548","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel3/4844/13395/00613548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1997.613548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13395","startPage":"363","endPage":"367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behaviour of higher order blind source separation methods in the presence of cyclostationary correlated multipaths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=613548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Behaviour of higher order blind source separation methods in the presence of cyclostationary correlated multipaths","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613548/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5794182","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behaviour of higher order blind source separation methods in the presence of cyclostationary correlated multipaths","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00613548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05845S","chronDate":"21-23 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4844","citationCount":"3","articleId":"613548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":613588,"authors":[{"name":"Shi-Sheng Lee","affiliation":["UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shi-Sheng Lee","id":"37281132900"},{"name":"E.

To date we have measured contractile forces up to 32 /spl mu/N in response to an externally applied calcium stimulus.","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613617","startPage":"199","endPage":"200 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4846/13397/00613617.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single heart cell force measured in standard CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force measurement","Heart","Measurement standards","Piezoresistance","Transducers","Signal to noise ratio","Bridge circuits","Structural beams","Capacitive sensors","Calcium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force measurement","cardiology","CMOS integrated circuits","cellular biophysics","piezoresistive devices","strain gauges","biomedical electronics","biological techniques","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard CMOS","single heart cell force","active force","living individual heart cells","standard CMOS piezoresistive force transducer","signal-to-noise ratio","Wheatstone bridge","on-chip CMOS amplifier","cantilever beam deflection","strain gauge","saline environments","contractile forces","externally applied calcium stimulus","rat heart cell contractions","Ca"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Single heart cell force measured in standard CMOS","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-19 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5751668","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single heart cell force measured in standard CMOS","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00613617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046507S","chronDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4846","citationCount":"10","articleId":"613617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":613634,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The technique is performed at room temperature (cold weld) and at the back end of the process flow, and may thus provide a commercially viable alternative to monolithic integration and costly hybrid packages. The transfer is achieved using break-away tethers and by cold welding electroplated indium solder bumps to thick electroplated copper pads. Both high aspect ratio MEMS devices as well as surface micromachined devices have been successfully transferred using this method with no observable misalignment between moving and stationary parts. The ultimate tensile and shear strength of the solder bond is measured to be 11/spl plusmn/3 MPa and 9/spl plusmn/1 MPa respectively. The contact resistance is measured to be of the order of 1.5 m/spl Omega/ for a 65 /spl mu/m/spl times/65 /spl mu/m/spl times/4 /spl mu/m indium bump.","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13397","startPage":"265","endPage":"268 vol.1","pdfPath":"/iel3/4846/13397/00613634.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batch transfer of microstructures using flip-chip solder bump bonding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstructure","Bonding","Welding","Indium","Electrical resistance measurement","Assembly","Micromachining","Temperature","Monolithic integrated circuits","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-chip devices","lead bonding","micromachining","micromechanical devices","tensile strength","shear strength","mechanical strength","contact resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["batch transfer","flip-chip solder bump bonding","sacrificial-layer micromachining","cold weld","break-away tethers","aspect ratio","MEMS devices","surface micromachined devices","tensile strength","shear strength","contact resistance","1.5 mohm","4 micron","65 micron","In-Cu"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Batch transfer of microstructures using flip-chip solder bump bonding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613634/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5751685","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"19-19 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batch transfer of microstructures using flip-chip solder bump bonding","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00613634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032736S","chronDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4846","citationCount":"29","articleId":"613634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":613640,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The condenser microphone is made by micromachining of polyimide on silicon, and is compatible with CMOS technology. Therefore, the structure can be realised by post processing on substrates containing integrated circuits, independently of the IC process. Microphones with a required DC bias voltage of 4 V have been realised on a CMOS substrate containing PMOS buffer preamplifiers. From the measurements on these structures, it is illustrated how an immediate improvement of 4.8 dB of the microphone sensitivity and noise level can be obtained by using the integrated preamplifier. The measured sensitivity of the integrated condenser microphone was 2.5 mV/Pa and the equivalent noise level (ENL) was 29.5 dB(A) SPL.","doi":"10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.1997.613681","startPage":"445","endPage":"446 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4846/13397/00613681.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference (Transducers '97)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A polymer condenser microphone on silicon with on-chip CMOS amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A polymer condenser microphone on silicon with on-chip CMOS amplifier","conferenceDate":"19-19 June 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"5751732","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polymer condenser microphone on silicon with on-chip CMOS amplifier","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00613681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039413S","chronDate":"16-19 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4846","citationCount":"2","articleId":"613681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":613690,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The approach represents a path by a series of via points connected by elastic strings which are subject to displacement due to collisions with obstacle regions as well as constraints pertaining to the domain to which path planning is applied. Obstacle regions are represented by a potential field created by a multilayered neural network. A fast simulated annealing approach is used for local minima problems from the potential field. The automatic generation and removal of via points is incorporated in the path planning approach to ensure collision-free planning regardless of the complexity of the environment. Local and global bias on the potential field is used to avoid any existing singularities and local minima. Our path planning approach is flexible, efficient and massively parallel.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.1997.613846","startPage":"108","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation CIRA'97.

We describe a method for detecting frontiers in evidence grids and navigating to these frontiers. We also introduce a technique for minimizing specular reflections in evidence grids using laser-limited sonar. We have tested this approach with a real mobile robot, exploring real-world office environments cluttered with a variety of obstacles. An advantage of our approach is its ability to explore both large open spaces and narrow cluttered spaces, with walls and obstacles in arbitrary orientation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1997 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation CIRA'97.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network learning architecture to counter these problems. Namely, we combine (1) flexible cascade neural networks, which dynamically adjust the size of the neural network as part of the learning process, and (2) node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering (NDEKF), a fast converging alternative to backpropagation. In this paper, we first summarize how learning proceeds in cascade neural networks. We then show how NDEKF fits seamlessly into the cascade learning framework, and how cascade learning addresses the poor local minima problem of NDEKF. We analyze the computational complexity of our approach and compare it to fixed-architecture training paradigms. Finally, we report learning results for continuous function approximation and dynamic system identification-results which show substantial improvement in learning speed and error convergence over other neural network training methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613860/","accessionNumber":"5680147","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-11 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascade neural networks with node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00613860.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02632S","chronDate":"10-11 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4842","citationCount":"23","articleId":"613860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":613865,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Deng","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Kan Deng","id":"37613302600"},{"name":"A.W.

In many applications, these parameter vectors will be separable into different groups, due to the different underlying mechanisms that generate differing time series. We can then use classification algorithms to predict the class of a new, uncategorized time series. For the purposes of a highly autonomous system, our approach to this classification uses memory-based learning and intensive cross-validation for feature and kernel selection. In an example application, we distinguish between driving data of a skilled, sober driver vs. a drunk driver, by calculating the ARMA model for the respective time series. In this paper, we first give a brief introduction to the theory of time series.

We use an evolutionary algorithm as a means for active learning of a route map for the path planner. Given a source-destination pair, the path planner searches the map for a best matching route. If an acceptable match is not found, the planner uses another evolutionary algorithm to generate online a path for the source-destination pair.

Computer simulation shows that the proposed HMM-NN algorithm yields higher recognition rate compared with several conventional face recognition algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.613982","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1362 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13360/00613982.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.613982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid approaches to frontal view face recognition using the neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Image recognition","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Facial features","Face detection","Eyes","Computer simulation","Nose"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","edge detection","feature extraction","hidden Markov models","filtering theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","digital simulation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid approaches","frontal view face recognition","neural network","hidden Markov models","locally adaptive threshold scheme","facial features","generic knowledge","forward-backward algorithm","recognition rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid approaches to frontal view face recognition using the neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5691500","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid approaches to frontal view face recognition using the neural network","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00613982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039392S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"613982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":613996,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.G.

An ensemble consists a set of independently trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying instances. Previous research suggests that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper we evaluate bagging and boosting as methods for creating an ensemble of neural networks. We also include results from Quinlan's (1996) decision tree evaluation of these methods. Our results indicate that the ensemble methods can indeed produce very accurate classifiers for some dataset, but that these gains may depend on aspects of the dataset. In particular we find that bagging is probably appropriate for most problems, but when properly applied boosting may produce even larger gains in accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/613999/","accessionNumber":"5691508","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An empirical evaluation of bagging and boosting for artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical evaluation of bagging and boosting for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00613999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043633S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"12","articleId":"613999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":614000,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

Since a direct assessment from all wavelet coefficients will often turn out to be tedious or leads to inaccurate results, a preprocessing routine that computes robust features directly correlated to the process parameters is highly desirable. In this paper, a new efficient feature extraction method based on the fast wavelet transform is presented. This method divides the matrix of computed wavelet coefficients into clusters equal to row vectors.

This algorithm allows one to adaptively construct a better approximation for each block by optimally selecting the basis functions from a universal set. The convergence is guaranteed by orthogonalizing the selected bases at each iteration. The coefficients of the approximations are obtained by back-projection with convex combinations.

Unfortunately, the number of clusters in general is unknown to the user. Therefore, the clustering becomes a tedious trial-and-error work and the clustering result is often not very promising especially when the number of clusters is large. In this paper we propose a genetic algorithm for the clustering problem. This algorithm can automatically cluster the data according to their similarities and automatically find the proper number of clusters. In traditional classification methods, usually a set of parameters is used to represent a class. But in many case, although belonging to the same class, the data may be divided into several clusters and the data in each cluster may have different characteristics. Hence, we also apply the genetic algorithm to the classification problem and obtain good results especially when the situation stated above happened. Another genetic algorithm is proposed for the feature selection problem. This algorithm can not only search for a good set of features but also find the weight of each feature such that the application of these features associated with their weights to the classification problem will achieve a good classification rate.

The purpose is to achieve robot programming by demonstration. Instead of using geometric models of the workpieces, both methods use force sensor signals only. In the first method, fuzzy logic is used to model the patterns in the force signals. Membership functions are generated automatically from training data and then used by the fuzzy classifier. In the second method, a neural network architecture is used to learn the mapping from force signals to contact formation class. Experimental results are presented for both the fuzzy and neural network classifiers, and the results are compared. In some cases, the fuzzy classifier has better performance, and in other cases, the neural net classifier is better. The results are discussed, and, finally, a training modification is presented which dramatically improves the performance of the inadequate neural net classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614137/","accessionNumber":"5691549","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identifying contact formations from force signals: a comparison of fuzzy and neural network classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying contact formations from force signals: a comparison of fuzzy and neural network classifiers","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050871S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"10","articleId":"614137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":614139,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Lei Wang","id":"37087209463"},{"name":"Feihu Qi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"Feihu Qi","id":"37087170166"},{"name":"Yulong Mo","affiliation":["School of Communication & Information Engineering, Shanghai University, China"],"lastName":"Yulong Mo","id":"37087167483"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4122-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"614139","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Image restoration","Degradation","Hopfield neural networks","Image converters","Power engineering and energy","Neural networks","Filters","Equations","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","Hopfield neural nets","convergence","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degraded images","parallel self-feedback continuous Hopfield neural network model","global minimum","uniform velocity motion-blurred images","signal-to-noise ratio","visual quality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614139","abstract":"This paper proposes a modified full parallel self-feedback continuous Hopfield neural network model to restore degraded images.

A new learning algorithm is proposed which distributes the learning error to each subnetwork and enables online training. Several simulation results are provided, which show the robustness ability by the partitioned neurocontroller, and compare it with the results obtained through sliding mode control.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614161","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13360/00614161.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1760 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust telemanipulator control using a partitioned neural network architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Robust telemanipulator control using a partitioned neural network architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5691572","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust telemanipulator control using a partitioned neural network architecture","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032276S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"614161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":614162,"authors":[{"name":"Sangbong Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sangbong Park","id":"37087285439"},{"name":"Cheol Hoon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"lastName":"Cheol Hoon Park","id":"37087195664"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4122-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"614162","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Robots","Manipulator dynamics","Uncertainty","Control systems","Neural networks","Adaptive control","Trajectory","Cost function","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","tracking","neurocontrollers","uncertain systems","feedback","genetic algorithms","suboptimal control","manipulator dynamics","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based path planning","tracking control","neural networks","planar robot manipulator","system uncertainty","obstacles","feedback","suboptimal trajectory","optimal trajectory","evolutionary algorithm","neural controller","compensation","tracking errors","uncertainty","disturbance","robustness","tracking performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614162","abstract":"In this paper, a new method is presented for a path planning and tracking control of a planar robot manipulator in the presence of system uncertainty and obstacles using neural networks combined with the conventional feedback controller.

The most significant contribution of CMSEHN is that it guarantees the convergence of the learning procedure with fast speed, automatically determines the number of neurons in the hidden layer and selects much effective hidden nodes to improve the generalization ability of network. Also, CMSEHN can solve the two problems of the other construction methods, that are difficulty in improving generalization ability and difficulty in applying them to problems with analog input vectors of different length. In the meantime, the network constructed by CMSEHN is able to learn an arbitrary training set. Experiment results of handwritten digit recognition show that the network constructed by CMSEHN has good learning and generalization performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614189","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1906 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13360","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13360/00614189.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A construction method of feedforward neural network for selecting effective hidden nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614189/","displayDocTitle":"A construction method of feedforward neural network for selecting effective hidden nodes","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5691599","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A construction method of feedforward neural network for selecting effective hidden nodes","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063046S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"614189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":614192,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

The number of hidden layer neurons determine the order of the neural network model and consequently the generalization performance of the network. This paper puts into perspective the approaches used to address this problem and presents a new paradigm which uses dependent evolution of hidden layer neurons to self-regulate the model order. We show through simulations that despite an abundance of free-parameters (i.e. starting with a larger than necessary network), the proposed paradigm allows for localization of specializing hidden layer neurons with the unspecialized hidden layer neurons behaving similarly. These similarly behaving neurons reduce the model order and allow for the benefits of a smaller sized network.

The experimental and the simulation results substantiate the practical effects of the proposed method for a class of dynamic systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614221","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614221.pdf","startPage":"2067","endPage":"2071 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of unmeasured inputs using recurrent neural networks and the extended Kalman filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of unmeasured inputs using recurrent neural networks and the extended Kalman filter","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5691627","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of unmeasured inputs using recurrent neural networks and the extended Kalman filter","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039873S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"17","articleId":"614221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614225,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Each neural network is iteratively trained on the training data which the previous neural networks could not guarantee or produce proper results. Each network works by filtering out unsatisfactory instances to pass to the next sub-network to handle. This approach provides a way, by exploring different search spaces, to handle the local minima problem without complex computations via the use of neural networks working in parallel.

The comparison shows that neural nets outperform the conventional techniques with regard to the prediction quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614234/","accessionNumber":"5697704","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sales forecasting using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sales forecasting using neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019273S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"24","articleId":"614234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":614235,"authors":[{"name":"T.-W.

The learning rules can be derived from different viewpoints such as information maximization, maximum likelihood and negentropy which result in similar rules for the weight update. We transform the learning rule into the frequency domain where the convolution and deconvolution property becomes a multiplication and division operation. In particular the FIR polynomial algebra techniques as used by Lambert present an efficient tool to solve true phase inverse systems allowing a simple implementation of noncausal filters. The significance of the methods is shown by the successful separation of two voices and separating a voice that has been recorded with loud music in the background. The recognition rate of an automatic speech recognition system is increased after separating the speech signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614235.pdf","startPage":"2129","endPage":"2134 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation of real world signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Finite impulse response filter","Automatic speech recognition","Independent component analysis","Sensor arrays","Frequency domain analysis","Convolution","Biology computing","Deconvolution","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","convolution","deconvolution","maximum entropy methods","neural nets","FIR filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","signal processing","deconvolution","noncausal FIR filters","learning rules","information maximization","maximum likelihood","negentropy","learning rule","frequency domain","convolution","polynomial algebra","phase inverse systems","speech recognition","neural nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation of real world signals","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5697705","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation of real world signals","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056909S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"78","articleId":"614235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614237,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

Moreover, the number of non-recurrent hidden neurons can be arbitrarily increased according to the complexity of a given problem with a relatively little increase in computation during training.

Theoretical researches focus on the capabilities of the network to reach an optimal solution. Unfortunately, few results concerning the design, and training of the network are available. When dealing with a specific application, the performances of the network dramatically depend on the number of neurons and on the distribution of the hidden neurons in the input space. Generally, the network resulting from learning applied to a predetermined architecture, is either insufficient or over-complicated. In this study, we focus on genetic learning for the RBF network applied to prediction of chaotic time series. The centers and widths of the hidden layer neurons basis function-defined as the barycenter and distance between two input patterns-are coded into a chromosome. It is shown that the basis functions which are also coded as a parameter of the neurons provide an additional degree of freedom resulting in a smaller optimal network. A direct matrix inversion provides the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer and avoids the risk of getting stuck into a local minimum. The performances of a network with Gaussian basis functions is compared with those of a network with genetic determination of the basis functions on the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5697716","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"RBF neural network, basis functions and genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBF neural network, basis functions and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040062S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"15","articleId":"614247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":614249,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Through tracking a set of world points of unknown coordinates, the internal parameters of the cameras (including lens distortions), the mounting parameters as well as the coordinates of the world points are estimated. The approach is fully autonomous, in that no initial guesses of the unknown parameters are to be provided from the outside by humans for the solution of a set of nonlinear equations. Sufficient conditions for a unique solution are derived in terms of controlled motion sequences. To improve robustness of the calibration, we propose to identify the best lens-distortion model by using F-test.

In many robotic control strategies it is assumed that the actuator is an ideal torque source. However, converting harmonic drive systems to ideal torque sources is still a challenging control problem for researchers. In this paper the torque control of harmonic drive system under free motion is examined in detail. A built-in torque sensor is developed in order to measure the torque, and by employing a Kalman filter the undesired torque signatures like torque ripples and misalignment torque are filtered out. An empirical nominal model for the system is obtained through experimental frequency response estimates, and the deviation of the system from the model is encapsulated by multiplicative uncertainty. A robust torque controller is subsequently designed in an H/sub /spl infin//-framework and implemented employing Kalman filtered torque estimates. From time and frequency domain experiments, it is shown that the closed-loop system retains robust stability, while improving the tracking performance exceptionally well.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.614402","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13374/00614402.pdf","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1754 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.614402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent torque sensing and robust torque control of harmonic drive under free-motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent torque sensing and robust torque control of harmonic drive under free-motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5684992","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent torque sensing and robust torque control of harmonic drive under free-motion","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00614402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02521S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"15","articleId":"614402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-18"},{"_id":614423,"authors":[{"name":"F.S.

Modeling of nonlinear systems using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) is a promising approach to the knowledge acquisition, and a FNN is specially designed for knowledge extraction. The authors have proposed a hierarchical fuzzy modeling method using FNNs and a genetic algorithm (GA). This method can identify fuzzy models of nonlinear objects with strong nonlinearity. The disadvantage of the method is that the training of the FNN is time consuming. This paper presents a quick method for a rough search for proper structures in the antecedent of fuzzy models. The fine tuning of the acquired rough model is done by the FNN. This modeling method is quite efficient to identify precise fuzzy models of systems with strong nonlinearities. A simulation is done to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614437/","accessionNumber":"5697752","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge extraction from hierarchical fuzzy model obtained by fuzzy neural networks and genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge extraction from hierarchical fuzzy model obtained by fuzzy neural networks and genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045409S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"6","articleId":"614437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":614439,"authors":[{"name":"N.K.

The proposed approach consists of two procedures: rule extraction from a trained neural network and rule selection by a genetic algorithm. We first describe how linguistic rules can be extracted from a multilayer feedforward neural network that has been already trained for a classification problem with many continuous attributes. In our rule extraction procedure, a linguistic input vector corresponding to the antecedent part of a linguistic rule is presented to the trained neural network, and the fuzzy output vector front the trained neural network is examined for determining the consequent part and the grade of certainty of that linguistic rule. Next we explain how a genetic algorithm can be utilized for selecting a small number of significant linguistic rules from a large number of extracted rules. Our rule selection problem has two objectives: to minimize the number of selected linguistic rules and to maximize the number of correctly classified patterns by the selected linguistic rules. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed for finding a set of non-dominated solutions with respect to these two objectives. Finally we illustrate our hybrid approach by computer simulations on real-world test problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614441/","accessionNumber":"5697755","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Linguistic rule extraction from neural networks and genetic-algorithm-based rule selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linguistic rule extraction from neural networks and genetic-algorithm-based rule selection","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042376S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"12","articleId":"614441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":614446,"authors":[{"name":"N.E.

The new operator adaptively decides the division points of each chromosome for the bacterial mutation and the cutting points for the crossover, according to the distribution of degrees of truth values of the rules.

In the proposed MRAC system adopting overparameterization and a robust adaptive algorithm, the boundedness of the estimated parameters is assured under some conditions. Second, an adaptive linearization scheme for Wiener systems with nonlinearity in their output part is realized by using a kind of functional-link network.

A synchronous type motor-generator is used for power input/output. Each flywheel system consists of four disk modules made from a carbon fibre composite material, rated at 125 kWh and weighing 3 t. Passive superconducting bearings, integrated into the disk modules, are used for frictionless levitation. The operating speed will be in the 2250...4500 RPM range. Maximum rim velocity is 600 m/s with a maximum tensile stress of 810 MPa. Details of the system layout are discussed, addressing thermal design and subsystems such as power conditioning system and cooling facilities. A preliminary cost analysis has been worked out. In the Western European UCPTE (Union for the Coordination of Production and Transport of Electricity) high power system, the plant could be used to provide spinning reserve for about 30 s while conventional thermal generating units ramp up to meet the increased load during peak power periods. Other applications in the electric utility field include power conditioning and stabilization in portions of a high-voltage power system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/13416/00614513.pdf","doi":"10.1109/77.614513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.614513","startPage":"398","endPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conceptual system design of a 5 MWh/100 MW superconducting flywheel energy storage plant for power utility applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614513/","displayDocTitle":"Conceptual system design of a 5 MWh/100 MW superconducting flywheel energy storage plant for power utility applications","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5655770","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conceptual system design of a 5 MWh/100 MW superconducting flywheel energy storage plant for power utility applications","sourcePdf":"00614513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053023S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"47","articleId":"614513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614518,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The power conversion equipment necessary for connecting a SMES coil to a dc system is much simpler and easier to control than the interface needed to connect a SMES coil to an ac system. There is also added flexibility if the LVdc system is mesh connected. The LVdc system already has the power conditioning necessary for connection to the ac load and supply systems. The SMES coil can be connected to the LVdc mesh either through a dedicated dc-dc converter or it can be added directly into the mesh and controlled using the converters already present on the mesh. The rectifier voltage regulation schemes control the charging and discharging of the coil. If one of the rectifiers is supplied by a unit-connected generator, a simpler rectifier scheme can be used, and the generator field excitation control can be used to control the SMES coil. The SMES coil could then be used both to level generator loading and provide added reliability in case of disturbances on the ac supply system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","publicationDate":"June 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5655775","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of a SMES coil into a superconducting LVdc transmission system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of a SMES coil into a superconducting LVdc transmission system","sourcePdf":"00614518.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038144S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"4","articleId":"614518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":614631,"authors":[{"name":"B.

From the results of the authors' previous analysis, the magnetic field acting on the superconducting wires of an air-core transformer under load includes the rotating component besides the alternating component. Since this rotating component has a possibility of affecting the wire stability, the influence should be clarified. In this paper, a method of stability limit analysis based on the instantaneous magnetic field calculation is proposed. Quench tests of an experimental air-core superconducting transformer are carried out, and the stability limit of the air-core superconducting transformer is analyzed by using the proposed method. From the results of the analysis, it is seen that the load factor of the superconducting wire, which is defined in this paper, is almost the same regardless of the superconducting power transformer load.","doi":"10.1109/77.614680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/13416/00614680.pdf","startPage":"1013","endPage":"1016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.614680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of air-core superconducting power transformer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614680/","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of air-core superconducting power transformer","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5676535","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of air-core superconducting power transformer","sourcePdf":"00614680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025966S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"13","articleId":"614680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614684,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

There has been a proliferation of techniques aimed at redressing this situation and, in particular, for extracting the knowledge embedded in trained feedforward ANNs as sets of symbolic rules. However, if the dissemination of ideas in the field of ANN rule extraction is to proceed in a systematic manner, then it is essential that a rigorous taxonomy exists for categorizing the plethora of techniques being developed. This paper shows how one of the proposed schemas for categorizing ANN rule extraction techniques is able to accommodate such developments in the field. In addition attention is drawn to what are seen to be some of the key challenges in the area including the identification of factors which appear to limit what is actually achievable through the rule extraction process.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614691","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614691.pdf","startPage":"2530","endPage":"2534 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The truth is in there: current issues in extracting rules from trained feedforward artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"The truth is in there: current issues in extracting rules from trained feedforward artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5691664","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The truth is in there: current issues in extracting rules from trained feedforward artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038745S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"6","articleId":"614691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":614693,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

Most of this work has focused on the simplest class of deterministic state machines, that is deterministic finite automata and Mealy (or Moore) machines. The class of translations these machines can perform is very limited, mainly because these machines output symbols at the same rate as they input symbols, and therefore, the input and the translation have the same length; one may call these translations synchronous. Real-life translations are more complex: word reorderings, deletions, and insertions are common in natural-language translations; or, in speech-to-phoneme conversion, the number of frames corresponding to each phoneme is different and depends on the particular speaker or word. There are, however, simple deterministic, finite-state machines (extensions of Mealy machines) that may perform these classes of \"asynchronous\" or \"time-warped\" translations. A simple DTRNN model with input and output control lines inspired on this class of machines is presented and successfully applied to simple asynchronous translation tasks with interesting results regarding generalization. Training of these nets from input-output pairs is complicated by the fact that the time alignment between the target output sequence and the input sequence is unknown and has to be learned: we propose a new error function to tackle this problem. This approach to the induction of asynchronous translators is discussed in connection with other approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614693.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2540 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous translations with recurrent neural nets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Automata","Informatics","Computer networks","Hafnium","Inference algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","finite state machines","multilayer perceptrons","learning (artificial intelligence)","generalisation (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous translations","recurrent neural nets","discrete-time recurrent neural networks","finite-state machines","computational equivalence","deterministic finite automata","Mealy machines","Moore machines","word reorderings","natural-language translations","speech-to-phoneme conversion","deterministic finite-state machines","time-warped translations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous translations with recurrent neural nets","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5691665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous translations with recurrent neural nets","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028513S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"10","articleId":"614693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614698,"authors":[{"name":"N.K.

In this paper, according to the characteristics of the bank check, a fault tolerant Chinese bank check recognition system is presented and analyzed in detail. First, a high performance SOM classifier is adopted as the classifier to the numerals in the bank check. Next, a simple method is presented of SOM classifier to provide second recognition choice of the input numerals. We also propose a new idea of fault-tolerant recognition in the paper. With the combination of SOM classifier and fault tolerant technique, this system can reach high recognition rate and high reliability simultaneously in automatic processing of bank checks with the dynamic cipher code. A practical scheme of fault-tolerant recognition of bank check is described.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614705","startPage":"2560","endPage":"2565 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614705.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fault tolerant Chinese bank check recognition system based on SOM neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","Neural networks","Character recognition","Handwriting recognition","Optical character recognition software","Automation","Finance","Forgery","Laboratories","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cheque processing","banking","self-organising feature maps","fault tolerant computing","character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chinese bank check recognition system","SOM neural networks","image classifier","fault-tolerant recognition","reliability","dynamic cipher code","banking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A fault tolerant Chinese bank check recognition system based on SOM neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5691670","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault tolerant Chinese bank check recognition system based on SOM neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028188S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"2","articleId":"614705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":614707,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The structure of the network is similar to the one presented by Day-Davenport (1993), that is, in addition to the weights of the synaptic connections, we model their length through a parameter that indicates the delay a discrete event suffers when going from the origin neuron to the target neuron through a synaptic connection. Like the weights, these delays are also trainable, and a training algorithm can be obtained that is almost as simple as the backpropagation algorithm, and which is really an extension of it. We present an application of these networks to the task of identifying normal QRS and ventricular QRS complexes in an ECG signal with the network receiving the signal sequentially, that is, no windowing or segmentation is applied.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.614707","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13362/00614707.pdf","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2570 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.614707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synaptic delay based artificial neural networks and discrete time backpropagation applied to QRS complex detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Synaptic delay based artificial neural networks and discrete time backpropagation applied to QRS complex detection","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5691671","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synaptic delay based artificial neural networks and discrete time backpropagation applied to QRS complex detection","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00614707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048556S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","articleId":"614707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":614726,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

This resource scheduling/allocation problem consists of determining when and on which unit to schedule a given task with the objective of minimizing total execution time, while respecting precedence relations and resource constraints. In this paper, we use a branch and bound search method with a non deterministic heuristic to find quasi optimal solution to the allocation problem. Partial schedules are built up starting at time 0 and proceed systematically by adding at each decision point subsets of activities until a complete feasible schedule is obtained. At each decision point m, the procedure identifies all operations that can be put in progress according to precedence rules. If it is impossible to schedule all eligible activities at time m, a heuristic is used to determine which operations are to be scheduled and which are to be delayed. The key idea of the heuristic is that, given the set of available resources (AR) and the set of candidate operations (SC) that meet precedence constraints, the criteria for matching operation j with resource k is a probabilistic decision based on quantifying the opportunity cost of k and the scheduling urgency of j.","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

In the first phase of the system's operation, time-varying visual speech patterns are obtained from a sequence of images. In the second phase, the system uses recurrent neural networks to classify the spatio-temporal pattern as one of the previously-trained words. By specifying a certain behavior when a recurrent network is presented with exemplar sequences, the network is trained with no more than feed-forward complexity. The network's desired behavior is based on characterizing a given word by well-defined segments. Adaptive segmentation is employed to segment the training sequences of a given word.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1997.614788","startPage":"55","endPage":"58 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

The characteristics of the expected signal classes are stored in the form of histograms that record the frequencies of all possible amplitude changes and phase changes of subsequent symbols. The histogram of a received signal of unknown class is cross-correlated with all the stored histograms. The resulting scores are combined using a discriminant function to yield a classification decision. The new QAM discrimination method may offer several advantages over existing methods due to the fact that the classification decisions are based on a large number of symbol to symbol changes. Specifically, the relative nature of the symbol to symbol measurements and the finite bin sizes used in the histograms make the proposed method substantially immune to receiver errors related to carrier recovery, symbol timing recovery, channel equalization, and channel noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

The block-diagonal structure of the BDRNN is exploited to modify the backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) algorithm to reduce the storage requirements while still maintaining exactness and locality of gradient computation. To achieve this, a numerically stable method for recomputing the state variables in the backward pass of the BPTT algorithm is presented.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1997.614848","startPage":"297","endPage":"300 vol.1","publicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

We have also proposed the incremental inter-neuron communication method. In the incremental communication method, instead of communicating the full magnitude of the output value of a node, only the (reduced precision) increment or decrement to its previous value is sent on a communication link. In this paper, Partan is modified to incorporate incremental communication. The effects of the limited precision incremental communication method on the convergence behaviour and performance of the Partan backpropagation algorithm are investigated with the sonar problem discussed in literature. It is found through simulation that the communication costs during the training process decrease by a factor of 1.6. The application of the incremental reduced precision Partan method to larger networks is expected to result into even higher savings in communication costs.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1997.614849","pdfPath":"/iel3/4813/13408/00614849.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"304 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE '97.

It is implemented in an aggressive static CMOS technology with a 0.20-/spl mu/m effective channel length. The multiplier has been demonstrated in a single-image shared-memory multiprocessor at frequencies up to 400 MHz. The multiplier requires three machine cycles for a total latency of 7.5 ns, though the design can support a latency of 4.0 ns if the latches are removed. The design goal was to implement a versatile S/980 multiplier with reasonable performance at a very aggressive cycle time. The multiplier implements a radix-8 Booth algorithm and is capable of supporting S/390 floating-point and fixed-point multiplications, and also divisions and square roots. Logic design and physical design issues are discussed relating to the Booth decoding and counter tree implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614873","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","startPage":"2","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A radix-8 CMOS S/390 multiplier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A radix-8 CMOS S/390 multiplier","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614873/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5680085","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A radix-8 CMOS S/390 multiplier","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047791S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"21","articleId":"614873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":614875,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Higher division performance is achieved by retiring more quotient bits in each cycle. Previous research has shown that realistic stages are limited to radix-2 and radix-4. Higher radix dividers are therefore formed by a combination of low-radix stages. In this paper, we present an analysis of the effects of radix-2 and radix-4 SRT divider architectures and circuit families on divider area and performance. We show the performance and area results for a wide variety of divider architectures and implementations. We conclude that divider performance is only weakly sensitive to reasonable choices of architecture but significantly improved by aggressive circuit techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614875.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRT division architectures and implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"SRT division architectures and implementations","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5680087","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRT division architectures and implementations","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077943S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"53","articleId":"614875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614876,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

The interpolation method employs a compressed look-up table and a small-sized multiplier to yield an output reciprocal as a simple direct operation. The leading bits of the arbitrarily precise input are used to index the table, and a limited number of succeeding fractional bits are used to interpolate on the table employing a multiply/add operation.

The interpolation method generates 2k-bit faithful reciprocals employing a k-bits-in, (2k+2)-bits-out table and a (k+3)/spl times/(k+3)-bit multiplier. A single-precision faithful reciprocal can be generated employing a table of size 13 kBytes and a 15/spl times/15-bit multiplier, compared to a table size of 46 MBytes for conventional reciprocal tables.

As a result, any improvement in the delay for performing this operation could have a positive impact on clock speed, instruction time and processor performance. In this paper, we show how, by extending our view of a parallel multiplier, we can apply recent innovations in parallel multiplier design to multiply-accumulators. This application results in multiply-accumulators that are as fast as multipliers of the same size (these multipliers have been shown to result in provably optimal delays faster than current designs). This allows a single (optimal multiply-accumulate) circuit to be used for both operations without delay penalty. As a result, multiply-accumulate can be efficiently and effectively implemented as an instruction in RISC CPUs. Additionally, the circuit design reduces the number of devices needed over current fast multiplier designs, so that real estate and power savings also result.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614884","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614884.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing multiply-accumulate operation in multiplication time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementing multiply-accumulate operation in multiplication time","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5680096","publicationDate":"1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing multiply-accumulate operation in multiplication time","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024097S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"15","articleId":"614884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614885,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The main problem in the algorithm is that the modulus of the vector is scaled in each CORDIC iteration so that a direct comparison of y[j] with t does not assure convergence. We present a scheme that overcomes this and in which the implementation consists of a standard CORDIC module plus a module to determine the direction of rotation. This improves over a previous proposal in which more complex iterations are introduced as part of the CORDIC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614885","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614885.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORDIC vectoring with arbitrary target value","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CORDIC vectoring with arbitrary target value","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5680097","publicationDate":"1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614885/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CORDIC vectoring with arbitrary target value","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022436S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"3","articleId":"614885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":614886,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

The industry wide usage of performance benchmarks, such as SPECmarks, and the popularity of 3D graphics applications forces processor designers to pay particular attention to implementation of the floating point unit, or FPU. The paper presents results of the Stanford subnanosecond arithmetic processor (SNAP) research effort in the design of hardware for floating point addition, multiplication and division. We show that one cycle FP addition is achievable 32% of the time using a variable latency algorithm. For multiplication, a binary tree is often inferior to a Wallace tree designed using an algorithmic layout approach for contemporary feature sizes (0.3 /spl mu/m). Further, in most cases two bit Booth encoding of the multiplier is preferable to non Booth encoding for partial product generation. It appears that for division, optimum area performance is achieved using functional iteration, and we present two techniques to further reduce average division latency.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614891.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The SNAP project: design of floating point arithmetic units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floating-point arithmetic","Delay","Encoding","Computer applications","Computational complexity","Computer graphics","Application software","Process design","Hardware","Binary trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","computational complexity","mathematics computing","mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNAP project","floating point arithmetic units","computer applications","computational complexity","industry wide usage","performance benchmarks","SPECmarks","3D graphics applications","processor designers","FPU","Stanford subnanosecond arithmetic processor","floating point addition","multiplication","division","variable latency algorithm","binary tree","Wallace tree","algorithmic layout approach","contemporary feature sizes","two bit Booth encoding","partial product generation","functional iteration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"The SNAP project: design of floating point arithmetic units","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5680102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The SNAP project: design of floating point arithmetic units","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035926S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"43","articleId":"614891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":614899,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

The speed of the exponentiation algorithm largely depends on the availability of a fast method for multiplying two polynomials of length w defined over GF(2). The theoretical analysis and experiments indicate that the proposed exponentiation method is at least 6 times faster than the exponentiation method using the standard multiplication when w=8. Furthermore, the availability of a 32-bit GF(2) polynomial multiplication instruction on the underlying processor would make the new exponentiation algorithm up to 37 times faster.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 13th IEEE Sympsoium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel3/4854/13407/00614899.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast software exponentiation in GF(2/sup k/)","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1997.614899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1997.614899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=614899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/614899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast software exponentiation in GF(2/sup k/)","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5680110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast software exponentiation in GF(2/sup k/)","confLoc":"Asilomar, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00614899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030891S","chronDate":"6-9 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4854","citationCount":"2","articleId":"614899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":615044,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The simulation was constructed to model the case of a source antenna in close proximity to the Earth's surface with receiving antennas both in the ground and on the Earth's surface. The objective of the modeling and simulation was the prediction of the back scattered temporal and spatial waveforms from various objects buried in the partially conducting subsurface layers of the Earth. In the author's investigation three primary modifications were performed to the simulation code. First, the code was ported from a mainframe computer to a Sun work station. This involved splitting the simulation into a data calculation phase and an interactive data display phase. During the calculation phase, all the simulation results are computed to create time histories of the total electromagnetic field in a region of space which included both the source antenna and all the receive antenna locations. The receive antennas were located both on the surface of the Earth as well as buried within the subsurface layers of the Earth. The calculation phase creates a large matrix of time histories of the transmitted, scattered and total electromagnetic fields at all the sampled receive locations. An interactive display module was developed using MATLAB on the Sun workstation to view the results of the simulation. The second extension of the simulation code was the incorporation of coherent transmit and receive waveforms into the simulation. An analytic formulation of the transmit pulse into real and imaginary parts allows coherent signal generation and analysis. This permits the calculation of both amplitude and phase information for the incident, scattered and total electromagnetic fields during the calculation phase of the simulation. The third modification to the simulation code was the inclusion of the capability to place multiple scattering objects within the subsurface layers. The objects were allowed to be partially conducting and to have random statistical distributions of both size and spatial location. This represents a first attempt at providing simulation results for a simple two media model of an inhomogeneous layer. The simulation results to be shown include a variety of antenna and scattering object locations for various combinations of layered Earth models. The results are shown as color plots of the two dimensional maps of the electromagnetic fields as well as a pseudo animation of the two dimensional spatial maps. These pseudo animation results were obtained by sampling the hard copy color outputs of the simulation and display and combining them into a temporal record which approximates the time history animation results obtainable using the interactive display module. The matrix of simulation results of the complex values of the vector E and H fields may be processed with signal processing algorithms to create detection maps and image reconstructions. The model produces time histories of the complex field values at all points in the simulation volume. Since the field values are coherent, the data created by the simulation may be processed with temporal and spatial signal processing algorithms to develop simulated results of particular Earth models and scattering object geometries. This allows the creation of performance predictions of candidate signal sensing and processing approaches for the detection of man made objects buried in the Earth. A proposed sensing and processing system is described which allows the detection and imaging of man made buried objects.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1997.615299","publicationTitle":"IGARSS'97. 1997 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium Proceedings.

The topic has interesting implications for a wide range of radar remote sensing applications where the time evolution of the ecosystem is of importance. Focus will be given here to a thematic application-monitoring of the tropical forest-which is one of the major R/D activities within the European Commission TREES project, and which offered the motivation to develop the approach presented. The theory behind two statistical estimators, which were previously proposed by one of the authors, and that are used in the present study, is briefly summarized. Implementation issues which are specific to the case at hand are then discussed. Finally some results are presented, based on simulated SAR images and an ERS-1 time series acquired over the tropical forest in West Africa. The results highlight the performance of the filters, in terms of speckle suppression and restoration of the image texture. At this stage of the authors' research they can already conclude that the approach has a high potential for radar remote sensing applications; the key point is that it allows for the reconstruction of the underlying radar reflectivity time evolution at the full spatial resolution of the signal but with a dramatic improvement of the signal to noise ratio; the way is thus paved for reaching unprecedented results in the visual or automatic interpretation of SAR imagery.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1997.615338","publicationTitle":"IGARSS'97. 1997 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium Proceedings.

The only restriction is that the interprocessor communication cost is the same for any pair of processors. This is suitable for local area network based systems, such as Ethernet, as well as fully interconnected multiprocessor systems. An optimal polynomial solution exists if sufficient homogeneous processors and communication capacity are available. This solution is generalized to obtain two faster heuristics, one for the case of homogeneous processors and the other for heterogeneous processors. The heuristics were tested extensively with 60,900 systematically generated random TIGs and shown to be stable independent of the size of the TIG. A performance model is also proposed to predict the performance of the heuristic algorithms, and it is successful in explaining the experimental results qualitatively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615437/","volume":"8","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"5721153","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Allocating task interaction graphs to processors in heterogeneous networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocating task interaction graphs to processors in heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"00615437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060169S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"42","articleId":"615437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":615446,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper, a simplified model of a pushbroom sensor (the linear pushbroom model) is introduced. It has the advantage of computational simplicity while at the same time giving very accurate results compared with the full orbiting pushbroom model. Besides remote sensing, the linear pushbroom model is also useful in many other imaging applications. Simple noniterative methods are given for solving the major standard photogrammetric problems for the linear pushbroom model: computation of the model parameters from ground-control points; determination of relative model parameters from image correspondences between two images; and scene reconstruction given image correspondences and ground-control points. The linear pushbroom model leads to theoretical insights that are approximately valid for the full model as well. The epipolar geometry of linear pushbroom cameras is investigated and shown to be totally different from that of a perspective camera. Nevertheless, a matrix analogous to the fundamental matrix of perspective cameras is shown to exist for linear pushbroom sensors. From this it is shown that a scene is determined up to an affine transformation from two views with linear pushbroom cameras.","doi":"10.1109/34.615446","startPage":"963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/13427/00615446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.615446","endPage":"975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear pushbroom cameras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Linear pushbroom cameras","volume":"19","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5727080","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear pushbroom cameras","sourcePdf":"00615446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0537S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"257","articleId":"615446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":615448,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

Unfortunately, the complexity of most existing search algorithms, such as k-d tree and R-tree, grows exponentially with dimension, making them impractical for dimensionality above 15. In nearly all applications, the closest point is of interest only if it lies within a user-specified distance /spl epsiv/. We present a simple and practical algorithm to efficiently search for the nearest neighbor within Euclidean distance /spl epsiv/. The use of projection search combined with a novel data structure dramatically improves performance in high dimensions. A complexity analysis is presented which helps to automatically determine /spl epsiv/ in structured problems. A comprehensive set of benchmarks clearly shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm for a variety of structured and unstructured search problems. Object recognition is demonstrated as an example application. The simplicity of the algorithm makes it possible to construct an inexpensive hardware search engine which can be 100 times faster than its software equivalent. A C++ implementation of our algorithm is available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/13427/00615448.pdf","startPage":"989","endPage":"1003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.615448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.615448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=615448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple algorithm for nearest neighbor search in high dimensions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","Pattern recognition","Euclidean distance","Data structures","Search problems","Object recognition","Application software","Software algorithms","Hardware","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","search problems","data structures","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nearest neighbor search","high-dimensional spaces","pattern recognition","search algorithms","projection search","data structure","complexity analysis","object recognition","hardware search engine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A simple algorithm for nearest neighbor search in high dimensions","volume":"19","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719885","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple algorithm for nearest neighbor search in high dimensions","sourcePdf":"00615448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041914S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"202","articleId":"615448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":615449,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

In the military, object recognition is applied to the discrimination of military targets, ranging from human-aided to autonomous operations, and is called automatic target recognition (ATR). The research described here has been concentrated in human-aided target recognition applications, but some attention has been paid to automatic processes. Definitions and performance metrics that have been developed are described along with performance data showing the present state-of-the-art. The effects of signal-to-noise and clutter parameters are indicated in the data. Multisensor fusion and model-based algorithms are discussed as the latest techniques under consideration by the military research community. The results demonstrate that useful performance can be achieved, and tools are evolving to understand and improve the performance under real-world conditions.

First, the experienced optical engineer can usually determine, sometimes partly subjectively, the positions of phase wraps in the image. This suggests that the information necessary to identify phase wraps does exist. Second, to date, no universally applicable technique for phase wrap detection is available. Indeed, it may be that there is no straight forward analytical method that can be used. The concept of a neuron was first postulated by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and a neural network provides a mechanism by which a machine can learn from experience. The foregoing discussion suggests that neural network technology may be suitable for addressing the phase unwrapping problem. This paper describes preliminary work on the use of neural networks to identify phase wraps earlier in the phase measuring process, prior to the calculation of wrapped phase.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19970981","pdfPath":"/iel3/4857/13412/00615613.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"683 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","publicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19970981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase unwrapping in 3-D shape measurement using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Phase unwrapping in 3-D shape measurement using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5710217","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase unwrapping in 3-D shape measurement using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"00615613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022237S","chronDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13412","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4857","citationCount":"4","articleId":"615613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":615636,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

It is based on quaternion numbers, which may be thought of as a generalisation of the complex numbers with one real part and three imaginary parts. The transform is referred to the discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT). The DQFT is a useful generalisation of the two-dimensional complex DFT to the case of images with more than two (but not more than four) image components. Natural colour images are a significant example of such images and their three components, for example, red, green and blue, may now be transformed as a whole. There are some important further theoretical steps needed, however, to make generalisation of monochrome frequency domain techniques in image processing widely applicable to colour and other multispectral images.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4857/13412/00615636.pdf","startPage":"790","endPage":"793 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19971004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=615636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The discrete quaternion Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete quaternion Fourier transform","two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform","colour images","multispectral images","quaternion numbers","complex numbers","DQFT","two-dimensional complex DFT","image components","monochrome frequency domain techniques","image processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"The discrete quaternion Fourier transform","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5724195","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The discrete quaternion Fourier transform","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"00615636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028275S","chronDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13412","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4857","citationCount":"12","articleId":"615636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":615637,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A hierarchical knowledge-based localisation scheme is used to localise bones in the hand radiograph image. Bone contour detection is then implemented with further knowledge represented by active shape models (ASM). Hence a set of parameters is generated to describe the bone contour shape. The bone image is parameterised to describe its texture which is correlated to growth age. Regression and Bayesian methods are then used to model the characteristics of the most correlated shape parameters to the growth age as well as texture parameters in a training set. The models are finally applied to test images to estimate their bone ages. The Bayesian methods result in an 8.93% average relative error.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971008","publicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4857/13412/00615640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19971008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13412","startPage":"809","endPage":"813 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated vision system for skeletal age assessment using knowledge based techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=615640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"Automated vision system for skeletal age assessment using knowledge based techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615640/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5724199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated vision system for skeletal age assessment using knowledge based techniques","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"00615640.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044916S","chronDate":"14-17 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13412","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4857","citationCount":"11","articleId":"615640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":615669,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Kai Cliff Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Hung-Kai Cliff Choi","id":"37614440900"},{"name":"Chok-ki Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chok-ki Chan","id":"37384703300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4114-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"615669","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=615669","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sequences","Image coding","Vector quantization","Interpolation","Mesh generation","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Layout","Pixel","Signal generators","Signal processing algorithms"]}],"publicationTitle":"Fourth International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4853/13406/00615669.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00615669.png","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Sequence Coding Using Motion Embedded 3d Vector Quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-30 Aug. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/615669/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"25-30 Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image Sequence Coding Using Motion Embedded 3d Vector Quantization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Sequence Coding Using Motion Embedded 3d Vector Quantization","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00615669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039511S","chronDate":"25-30 Aug. 1996","isNumber":"13406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4853","citationCount":"16","articleId":"615669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":615705,"authors":[{"name":"I.B.

Ship tracks form long, thin, complex features in satellite images. These features do not typically follow straight lines or other low-order polynomial curves, making automated detection difficult. Nonetheless, the ability to automatically detect ship tracks is an important one, with military, navigation, environmental, and rescue applications. A multi-step automated approach for detection of ship tracks in AVHRR images has been developed. First, an enhanced ship track image is produced from AVHRR channels 1, 3, and 4. Ship tracks stand out as bright linear features, or ridges, in this enhanced image. Then a new technique called ridge detection by iterated erosion is applied to this enhanced image. Finally, postprocessing based on connected components analysis is used to eliminate ridges that do not correspond to ship tracks.","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.1997.615827","publicationTitle":"IGARSS'97. 1997 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium Proceedings.

This approach is based on a new formulation of an odd prime-length DCT algorithm. It uses two half-length cyclic convolutions with the same form, which are such reformulated that multipliers can be efficiently replaced by small biport ROMs and computed in parallel. Using this approach, high structural regularity, low hardware cost of the PE's and average computation time, and low I/O cost can be obtained. So, the average computation time has been reduced to one half and the throughput has been doubled, when compared with that of Guo et al. (1992). Thus an efficient systolic array for DCT, which is well suited for VLSI realization, can be obtained. It possesses also a much lower control complexity, it simpler interconnection structure, and a simpler hardware structure of the PEs, having thus a shorter cycle time.

Conventional or single-user detection so far has been preferred in CDMA receivers despite many shortcomings due to its simplicity. Multiuser detectors on the other hand can offer dramatically higher capacity at the expense of some increase in complexity. We consider the performance improvements afforded by multiuser detection of coded CDMA systems. We focus on two-stage detection schemes and particularly the two-stage detector with a conventional first stage and show that it is a robust detector under different operating conditions.

The Lyapunov exponent is measured for a single-layer recurrent network when the signal-amplitude gain of neurons is varied. Time-sequential output signals are also presented for elucidating what happens in the network. It is found in the experiment that the network has a wide range of stably dynamic behavior in the gain domain where a phase-directional motive force governs the dynamics. This phenomenon is in a contrast to the behavior of conventional recurrent networks having dynamic signals generated by the information geometry in real-number space. The result suggests that the recurrent complex-valued networks are more useful for a stably dynamic information processing such as oscillation, waveform synthesis and adaptive filtering than conventional networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616099/","accessionNumber":"5691371","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental analysis of behavior stability in neuron gain domain in recurrent complex-valued neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental analysis of behavior stability in neuron gain domain in recurrent complex-valued neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037092S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"2","articleId":"616099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":616105,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This and other approximate dynamic programming approaches have been discussed in the literature, all being members of the adaptive critic design family. It suggests and investigates several alternative procedures and compares their performance with respect to convergence speed and quality of resulting controller design. A modification is to introduce a real copy of the criticNN (criticNN 2) for making the \"desired output\" calculations, and this criticNN 2 is trained differently than is criticNN 1. The idea is to provide the \"desired outputs\" from a stable platform during an epoch while adapting the criticNN 1. Then at the end of the epoch, criticNN 2 is made identical to the then-current adapted state of criticNN 1, and a new epoch starts. In this way, both the criticNN 1 and the actionNN can be simultaneously trained online during each epoch, with a faster overall convergence than the older approach. The measures used suggest that a \"better\" controller design (the actionNN) results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616109","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616109","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616109.pdf","startPage":"712","endPage":"717 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training strategies for critic and action neural networks in dual heuristic programming method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Training strategies for critic and action neural networks in dual heuristic programming method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5691378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training strategies for critic and action neural networks in dual heuristic programming method","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026926S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"46","articleId":"616109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":616110,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The neural network is essentially composed of feedback-type connections, and arrays of integrators, linear gains, and nonlinear activation functions. By seeking a minimum energy state, the neural network solves for the sets of representation coefficients required to model a given signal in terms of elementary basis signals. An analytical model of the recurrent neural network was obtained through discretization of the integrator blocks and linearization of the activation function. Continuity of the algorithm when segment boundaries are crossed is made possible by varying the slope of the linearized activation function. The proposed approach results in a closed analytical form of the recurrent neural network solution. The perceived advantages are estimation of robustness, prediction of convergence by examining the eigenvalues of the analytical state matrix, and increase of computational speed. Moreover, unlike classical traditional methods, the approach offers the possibility of handling time-varying signals with uncertainties and considerable noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616138","startPage":"865","endPage":"870 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616138.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical and computational results on recurrent dynamic neural network for signal representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Signal representations","Gain","Energy states","Analytical models","State estimation","Noise robustness","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal representation","recurrent neural nets","transfer functions","convergence","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent dynamic neural network","signal representation","feedback-type connection","linear gains","nonlinear activation functions","minimum energy state","elementary basis signals","analytical model","closed analytical form","robustness","convergence prediction","eigenvalues","analytical state matrix","computational speed","time-varying signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Analytical and computational results on recurrent dynamic neural network for signal representation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5691407","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical and computational results on recurrent dynamic neural network for signal representation","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030313S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","articleId":"616138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":616139,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To the best of our knowledge, ETL is the first algorithm to synthesize a threshold network for an arbitrary switching function, automatically determining a required number of threshold elements in the hidden layer. For example, it turns out that the required number of threshold elements in the hidden layer of TLTN for an n-bit parity function is equal to n. Utilizing the fact that the threshold element in the proposed TLTN employs only integer weights and an integer threshold, we propose an efficient method to implement the proposed TLTN using current CMOS VLSI technology. The positive weights are realized using pMOS gates and negative weights using nMOS gates. The weights themselves are realized by manipulating the W/L (width/length) ratio of the respective transistor's channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616142","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616142.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"893 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI implementation of a 3-layer threshold network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI implementation of a 3-layer threshold network","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5691411","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI implementation of a 3-layer threshold network","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043347S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"616142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":616146,"authors":[{"name":"I.

We show measured results from an analog chip that solves the problem of system identification-identifying an unknown linear circuit from its input/output relationship.

The MPAA can be easily integrated into any host system via memory interface. Specifically, the MPAA system provides an efficient mechanism for its local memory accesses allowed by the row basis and the column basis using the hybrid row and column decoding, which is suitable for the computation model of ANNs such as the accessing and alignment patterns given for matrix-by-vector operations. Mapping algorithms to implement the multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning on the MPAA system are also provided. The proposed algorithms support both neuron and layer level parallelisms which allow the MPAA system to operate the learning phase as well as the recall phase in the pipelined fashion.

Usually, the back-propagation method is widely used as a learning rule of neural networks. Since the backpropagation needs error back propagation to update weights, realizing it in a form of hardware is relatively difficult. In this paper, we present a pulse density neural network system with learning ability. As learning rules, the simultaneous perturbation method is used. The learning rules need only one forward operation of networks. Thus, without a complicated circuit to calculate gradients of an error function, we could construct the network system with learning ability. Pulse density is used to represent basic quantities in this system. A result for the exclusive OR problem is shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616159/","accessionNumber":"5691428","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pulse density neural network system using simultaneous perturbation learning rule","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulse density neural network system using simultaneous perturbation learning rule","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027334S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","articleId":"616159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":616161,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the RNN model, each neuron accumulates arriving pulses and can fire if its potential at a given instant of time is strictly positive. Firing occurs at random, the intervals between successive firing instants following an exponential distribution of constant rate. When a neuron fires, it routes the generated pulses to the appropriate output lines in accordance with the connection probabilities. In the digital circuitry the fundamental parts of the neuron are simulated by realizing input module, neuron potential module, firing module and routing module. The neuron potential module accumulates incoming signals collected by the input module at the input site. The firing module generates random pulses with an exponential distribution of fixed rate. The pulses generated by the firing module are distributed to the other neurons through the routing module at the output side. A network of neurons can be constructed by using the digital circuitry presented for the single neuron. All the parts of the random neuron circuit are simulated by using Circuitmaker and Pspice digital simulation packages and the neuron is realized digitally by using LS-TTL ICs.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616163.pdf","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1004 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=616163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital neuron realization for the random neural network model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Neural networks","Pulse generation","Recurrent neural networks","Fires","Exponential distribution","Circuit simulation","Routing","Digital simulation","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","random processes","exponential distribution","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital neuron realization","random neural network model","digital circuitry","exponential distribution","connection probabilities","input module","neuron potential module","firing module","routing module","Circuitmaker","Pspice digital simulation packages","LS-TTL ICs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A digital neuron realization for the random neural network model","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5691432","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital neuron realization for the random neural network model","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044228S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"5","articleId":"616163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":616168,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method is described and demonstrated using 4 different sets of classification data.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616186","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1120 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616186.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector quantisation reduction method for the probabilistic neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616186/","displayDocTitle":"A vector quantisation reduction method for the probabilistic neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5691454","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector quantisation reduction method for the probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034464S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"12","articleId":"616186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":616187,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two types of neural identifiers, that are robust to adaptation-unworthy environmental parameters and adaptive to adaptation-worthy ones, are discussed, one requiring online weight adjustment and the other not. Risk-sensitive criteria are proposed for both training neural identifiers off-line and adjusting their weights online. These criteria induce robust performance by emphasising large errors in an exponential manner. A robust adaptive neural identifier without online weight adjustment is a time lagged recurrent network (TLRN) synthesized from input/output data of the dynamic system at with respect to a risk-sensitive criterion. The neural identifier's ability to adapt to the adaptation-worthy environmental parameters is a manifestation of the ability of the TLRN to estimate these parameters internally. A robust adaptive neural identifier with online weight adjustment is a neural network with long- and short-term memories. The long-term memory, which consists of the nonlinear weights of the neural network, is determined in an a priori off-line training in such a way that it is independent of the adaptation-worthy variables. The short-term memory, which consists of the linear weights of the neural network, is adjusted online to adapt to the adaptation-worthy variables. The criteria used for both the off-line determination of the long-term memory and the online adjustment of the short-term memory are risk-sensitive to induce the neural identifier's robust performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616187/","accessionNumber":"5691455","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive identification of dynamic systems by neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive identification of dynamic systems by neural networks","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040639S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"616187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":616189,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In order to maximize the throughput, a combinatorial optimization problem must be solved in real time of finding a switching configuration which does not only satisfy the constraints on the system, but also maximizes the number of copies under transmission demands. In this paper, we focus on the one-shot scheduling problem where all the copies of selected packets must be sent out simultaneously. We propose the neural network composed of W/spl times/N binary neurons for the problem in the W-window-N-input-port system. The motion equation is newly defined with three heuristic methods. We verify the performance through simulations in up to 3-window-1000-input-port systems, where our binary neural network provides the better performance than the existing methods so as to reduce the delay time under practical situations.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616216","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1271 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616216.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A binary neural network approach for one-shot scheduling problems in multicast packet switching systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Packet switching","Centralized control","Routing","Neurons","Equations","Informatics","Throughput","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","scheduling","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary neural network approach","one-shot scheduling problems","multicast packet switching systems","combinatorial optimization problem","switching configuration","heuristic methods","3-window-1000-input-port systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A binary neural network approach for one-shot scheduling problems in multicast packet switching systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","accessionNumber":"5691484","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A binary neural network approach for one-shot scheduling problems in multicast packet switching systems","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057238S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"1","articleId":"616216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":616218,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The goal of the approach is to divide a problem into sub-problems, solve them with parallel ANNs, then combine the resulting sub-solutions. The divide-and-conquer approach is based on a mathematical principle of orthogonal division errors, which provides the criteria for optimal problem division. The resulting division minimizes the cross-correlation among sub-problems, and hence the necessary communication among them. It therefore provides a minimum-communication allocation of sub-problems to parallel processors. Moreover, the divide and conquer can be done recursively, so that it occurs at all resolutions of the data. We show how wavelets can perform the necessary multiple-resolution data clustering. The divide-and-conquer approach is particularly effective for large-scale fractal data, which exhibits clustering over a large number of resolutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1997.616218","pdfPath":"/iel3/4831/13415/00616218.pdf","startPage":"1278","endPage":"1283 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1997.616218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-resolution divide and conquer neural networks for large-scale TSP-like energy minimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-resolution divide and conquer neural networks for large-scale TSP-like energy minimization problems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5691486","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-resolution divide and conquer neural networks for large-scale TSP-like energy minimization problems","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00616218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055505S","chronDate":"9-12 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4831","citationCount":"3","articleId":"616218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":616220,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The segmentation results obtained by SDNN can serve as important cues to effectively separate objects but also help obtain the accurate outline of each object. The segmented results enables the system to quickly adjust camera positions to the chosen object, and to obtain an accurate range map as well.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.1997.616296","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation Proceedings, EFTA '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4868/13441/00616296.pdf","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE 6th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation Proceedings, EFTA '97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.1997.616296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image segmentation using self-development neural network-applied to active stereo vision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Neural networks","Stereo vision","Neurons","Backpropagation algorithms","Frequency","Oceans","Sea measurements","Systematics","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","stereo image processing","active vision","vector quantisation","unsupervised learning","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","self-development neural network","active stereo vision","vitality measure","vitality conservation principle","biologically plausible vector quantization","learning parameters","camera positions","accurate range map"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Image segmentation using self-development neural network-applied to active stereo vision","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5717312","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image segmentation using self-development neural network-applied to active stereo vision","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00616296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037761S","chronDate":"9-12 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4868","articleId":"616296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":616338,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

Experimental results of a fuzzy logic based optimum flux search controller are presented. For transient states a new original idea is introduced: a fuzzy logic based controller actuating as a supervisor is proposed to work with reduced flux levels during transients to optimize efficiency also in dynamic mode. Two different rule tables are designed, for torque transitions and for reference speed changes. With this controller efficiency can be improved in transients, and also search controller convergence speed is increased. Experimental results with a 1.5 kW induction motor drive demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Induction motor drives","Induction motors","Motor drives","Environmental economics","Environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques","Industrial pollution","Steady-state","Torque","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","fuzzy logic","fuzzy control","machine control","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","economic saving","environmental pollution","fuzzy logic","steady-state efficiency optimization","fuzzy logic based optimum flux search controller","supervisor","dynamic mode","torque transitions","reference speed changes","convergence speed"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1997.616371","startPage":"219","endPage":"224 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4864/13437/00616371.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1997.616371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic based improvements in efficiency optimization of induction motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic based improvements in efficiency optimization of induction motor drives","accessionNumber":"5697009","publicationDate":"1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic based improvements in efficiency optimization of induction motor drives","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00616371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034802S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"18","articleId":"616371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":616378,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this paper, we formulate the threshold decision as a clustering problem. Feature parameters extracted from the analysis frame are clustered into three types: silence, consonants, and vowels. Distributed fuzzy rules which have been used in clustering the numerical data are used for this task. The distributed fuzzy rules, which do not need many training data, have good performance in clustering problems and are beneficial for clustering the features of speech data. Such a method, however, has many fuzzy if-then rules. So, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based method for selecting a small number of significant fuzzy if-then rules to construct a compact fuzzy classification system with high classification power. Effectiveness of this approach has been substantiated by classification experiments for continuous radio news speech samples uttered by two females and two males.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616406/","accessionNumber":"5697029","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed fuzzy rules for preprocessing of speech segmentation with genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed fuzzy rules for preprocessing of speech segmentation with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00616406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030906S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"1","articleId":"616406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":616408,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.K.

A suboptimal solution can be obtained by such an algorithm which applies the paradigm of various evolutionary selection and searches through many generations via different genetic operators. The selection of features associated with each individual is based on the fitness-proportionate selection in which parents are chosen from the population. This fitness is a problem-specific property that describes an individual's performance upon some chosen features quantitatively. This paper describes a formal fuzzy genetic algorithm to overcome the traditional problems in feature classification and selection and provides fuzzy templates for the identification of the smallest subset of features.

The most important feature of the proposed controller is its simple structure, consisting of a single input variable, three rules, and four design parameters. The four parameters are a fuzzy integral gain, a scalar factor for crisp output, and two parameters for the allocation of the membership functions of the fuzzy sets. A closed-form solution for the proportional control action is defined in terms of the design parameters. The nonlinear proportional gain is explicitly presented in the error domain. Through genetic algorithms, the optimal design of the system is achieved. This new method has been applied for two problems, a first-order process with/without a time delay, and an overdamped second-order process. A practical limitation on actuator saturation is considered in the simulation. Good simulation results were obtained using the present method, which produced superior control performance in handling nonlinearities due to time delay and saturation.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1997.616416","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4864/13437/00616416.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"496 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1997.616416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretic and genetic design of a three-rule fuzzy PI controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=616416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616416/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretic and genetic design of a three-rule fuzzy PI controller","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5697039","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretic and genetic design of a three-rule fuzzy PI controller","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00616416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03592S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"9","articleId":"616416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":616417,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

SCM has significant advantages over both conventional peak and average current-mode control techniques in noise susceptibility and dynamic range. The method supports both line and bulk load regulation, and reduces control complexity to a single loop. The static and dynamic performance of SCM are analyzed and verified experimentally for DC-DC converters. Performance in continuous and discontinuous modes compares favorably to conventional techniques when noise is not a factor, but is significantly better when noise and wide load ranges are a concern. The SCM method encompasses one-cycle control as a special case; the general SCM method is introduced here as a public domain control technique.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1997.616726","publicationTitle":"PESC97.

A four level inverter is able to synthesize better waveforms and attain higher voltages while reducing the device ratings. While converter device count and kVA are high, a conventional diode bridge rectifier is a low cost multilevel drive solution for the input rectifier if suitable inverter side DC voltage balancing schemes can be devised. This paper investigates the operation of four level rectifier/inverter based drives under commonly used modulation schemes. Link voltage balancing and output voltage capability are analyzed for a four level inverter. Simulation results are presented to verify the link voltage balancing strategy in the absence of any balancing action from the rectifier.","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC97.

This power amplifier is connected in parallel with the conventional 4-switch type full-bridge PWM power conversion circuit using IGBTs at their inputs/outputs in order to realize further high-power density. A digital optimal control scheme for PWM power conversion circuit requires minimization of the current ripple and improvement of dynamic response characteristics of the current in the gradient coils (GCs). It is proposed in this paper that a unique current tracking control scheme can achieve the research objective. This power amplifier can be easily used in the advanced MRI because the output current waves are not restricted to ramped-square waves and can assume any arbitrary wave forms. It is proved that the proposed technique will highly enlarge the diagnostic target and improve the image quality of MRI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Pulse width modulation","Power conversion","Bridge circuits","RLC circuits","Magnetic circuits","Switching circuits","Magnetic switching","Power generation","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NMR imaging","PWM power convertors","power amplifiers","bridge circuits","magnetic fields","digital control","electric current control","power engineering computing","switching circuits","dynamic response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digitally-controlled optimum current tracking scheme","two-paralleled high-power PWM amplifier","magnetic resonance imaging","switch-mode power current tracking technique","gradient magnetic field","4-switch type full-bridge PWM power conversion","IGBT","high-power density","digital optimal control","current ripple minimisation","dynamic response improvement","current tracking control","output current waves","diagnostic target enlargement","image quality improvement","digital control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.1997.616795","publicationTitle":"PESC97.

The proposed digital control scheme incorporates an inner current loop with an outer voltage loop to regulate the output voltage of the PWM inverter. The digital controller is designed through deadbeat theory so that the inverter can achieve fast dynamic response. To enhance the robustness of the PWM inverter concerned, an output voltage decoupling mechanism is added to improve the performance of the inner current loop. Besides, a load disturbance compensation scheme is also developed to remedy the voltage distortion caused by load variation. Both the frequency-domain and time-domain behavior of the proposed control scheme have been examined in this paper. A PWM inverter control system based on DSP TMS320C14 was constructed to verify the control law. The results show that the output voltage of the controlled PWM inverter has little distortion even under rough load conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1997.616798","publicationTitle":"PESC97.

It is shown that the complete suppression of the input current ripple of the system is only given in a theoretical extreme case. For a practical realization only such a ripple reduction of the input current of the basic converter structure is obtained as corresponds to a simple low-pass input filter. This is proven by a detailed analysis also for a zero-ripple Cuk and for a zero-ripple SEPIC converter structure. Furthermore, it is shown that the realization of a zero-ripple Cuk or zero-ripple SEPIC converter is not linked to a magnetic coupling of the input and output inductors, but can also be achieved by a simple rearrangement of the elements of the basic converter structures. There one can see that the operating behavior of a zero input current ripple SEPIC converter is equivalent to the operating behavior of a buck-boost converter stage with LC input filter. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the different realization approaches of zero-ripple topologies are compared. Also, an outlook towards the planned further treatment of the topic is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/616810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Jun 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-27 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5684747","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel aspects of an application of 'zero'-ripple techniques to basic converter topologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel aspects of an application of 'zero'-ripple techniques to basic converter topologies","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00616810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030701S","chronDate":"22-27 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4860","citationCount":"56","articleId":"616810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":616820,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

The load demand can exhibit abrupt changes from light load (<0.5 amps) to full load in a matter of few hundred nanoseconds. Future processor generations are projected to require greater current (up to 60 amps) at supply voltages as low as 1 volt. Furthermore, these future processors are projected to impose load steps with di/dt on the order of 5 amp/nS when the processor switches between inactive and active modes, or vice versa. In this paper, we discuss some of the ramifications for the design of the power supply required to supply these microprocessor loads. We focus on the use of a paralleled active circuit which can be thought of as an active clamp which is designed to support the load during transients. Breadboards of these circuits have been built and tested. A prototype IC design is currently under test.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1997.616898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1997.616898","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1185 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC97.

Decision of antecedent structures of fuzzy models of nonlinear systems is made possible by a combination of FNN and genetic algorithm (GA). The disadvantage of this fuzzy modeling method is that the learning of FNN is time consuming. This paper presents an efficient fuzzy modeling method using simple fuzzy inference. The results of fuzzy modeling are heavily dependent on evaluation criteria. This paper also studies effects of evaluation criteria for the decision of the antecedent structure.

Experience gained through the design, implementation, and testing of a three-phase, 50-kHz converter using this topology has revealed several issues and limitations of practical importance. One of the most important issues is the robustness of the basic control strategy to variations in circuit parameters and operating conditions. Several different variations are identified with a remedy in the form of an improved control strategy presented. The performance of this new control strategy is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1997.616923","publicationTitle":"PESC97.

Therefore, it yields inefficient inter-processor communications, low cpu utilization, and low system throughput. To solve these problems, we propose an improved genetic algorithm method for sender-initiated load balancing in distributed systems, and define a suitable fitness function. In this scheme, the processors that the request messages are transfered to are determined by genetic algorithm. The method also decreases unnecessary request messages. Compared with the conventional sender-initiated algorithms, we show that the proposed algorithm performs better.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1997.616928","startPage":"302","endPage":"307 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Conventional and Knowledge Based Intelligent Electronic Systems.

The lossless passive soft-switching converter properties and synthesis procedure are described and extended here for inverters. Promising half-bridge and full-bridge soft-switching inverter examples are shown from the synthesis results. The voltage stress across the main switches and snubber diodes can be easily maintained below 125% of V/sub bus/. No transformers are used for energy recovery, eliminating their associated diode stress and leakage inductance problems. The soft turn-on full bridge contains only six components. The soft turn-on/turn-off half-bridge contains 12 components. The theoretical and experimental waveforms and analysis are given.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1997.616955","publicationTitle":"PESC97.

The receiver consists of three major elements: (1) a nonlinear radio frequency (RF) front-end, (2) a signal sampler and formatting system (analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and demultiplexers), and (3) a patented \"monobit\" algorithm implemented as an ASIC for signal detection and frequency measurement. The receiver's front end, ADC and algorithm experimental performance results will be presented. The receiver uses a two-bit ADC operating at 2.5 GHz whose outputs are collected and formatted by demultiplexers for presentation to the ASIC. The ASIC has two basic functions: (1) perform a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and (2) determine the number of signals and report their frequencies. The ASIC design contains five stages: (1) the input, (2) the FFT, (3) the initial sort, (4) the squaring and addition, and (5) the final sort.

In this paper, we will show how a fast covering algorithm can be used as an evaluation engine for the decomposition phase. We show that decomposition has a significant impact on the quality of the final mapping result. More specifically, we show that starting from the same circuit topology, a blind decomposition leads to mapping results that use an average of 70 to 150% more LUTs compared to the results obtained using a technology driven decomposition algorithm. A technology driven decomposition algorithm is developed based on the proposed idea. Experiments on a number of MCNC benchmark circuits show an average of 12% to 72% improvement on the number of LUTs compared to the previously reported results.","doi":"10.1109/ASIC.1997.617006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASIC.1997.617006","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

It can handle mixed attributes, work with multiclass data, and remove irrelevant and redundant attributes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/13452/00617056.pdf","doi":"10.1109/69.617056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.617056","startPage":"642","endPage":"645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection via discretization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/617056/","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection via discretization","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5707409","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection via discretization","sourcePdf":"00617056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046385S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1997","isNumber":"13452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"203","articleId":"617056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":617150,"authors":[{"name":"Unawong","affiliation":["Department of Communication Eng.

First, by using the Middleton's (1977) class-A impulsive noise model, we evaluate the performance of conventional DS/CDMA system under impulsive radio noise and it is shown that the performance of the conventional DS/CDMA system is degraded by the effect of impulsive noise. Next, using the dependence between the quadrature components of impulsive radio noise, we propose a receiver designed for impulsive noise and evaluate the performance improvement achieved by this receiver. Moreover, in order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed receiver for actual impulsive radio noise, we evaluate the performance of the receiver under microwave oven interference. Numerical results conclude that the performance of the DS/CDMA system is much improved by using the proposed receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver design of CDMA system for impulsive radio noise environment","publicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/ELMAGC.1997.617150","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Proceedings of International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel3/4872/13446/00617150.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAGC.1997.617150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=617150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/617150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Receiver design of CDMA system for impulsive radio noise environment","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800654","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver design of CDMA system for impulsive radio noise environment","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00617150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034147S","chronDate":"21-23 May 1997","isNumber":"13446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4872","citationCount":"8","articleId":"617150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":617211,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We later thought of a more simple neural network analyzing only a small part of each image each time, with a preprocessor scanning the image. We finally preferred to simplify the role of the neural network by putting an image preprocessing sequence in front, to extract objects that were then identified by the neural network. We describe the sequence of treatments that we use and detail each processing step: improvement of the original image, extraction of significant objects (possible distresses) and identification of these objects by the neural network.

Cittolin and A. Fucci et al. (1995) describe a design approach for programmable message driven multi port memories (DPMs) with a high throughput (100 MByte/s). The design for nearly sequential requests (typical for some data acquisition systems (DAC)) causes accessing problems for more general applications. Considering hard real time requirements of DAC systems, the paper proposes two hardware implemented (based on FPGA technology) coprocessor architectures for searching in the file descriptor table of the dual port memory and compares them according to implementation costs and performance. Additionally the used searching strategy was implemented on the TI DSP C40 and the performance was compared to the hardware implementation. The examined hardware strategy is independent from the rest of the dual port memory and can therefore also be integrated into other computer systems as a generic searching coprocessor.","publicationTitle":"EUROMICRO 97.

Most studies on the effects of these parameters on the performance of GA-based systems have focused on a parameter at a time without considering the effect of other parameters on that parameter and vice versa. Consequently there is hardly any theory about the interactions and interdependencies of these parameters. This paper contributes towards correcting the situation mentioned above by examining empirically the relationship between two parameters of genetic algorithms (GAs): population size and replacement methods in the performance of GA-based systems. Results are presented that appear to show a link between replacement strategy and an appropriate population size when applying genetic algorithms to a particular problem. It is suggested that, in the domain of application considered in this paper one can infer that the more individuals that are replaced during reproduction the larger the population size that is needed for all optimum performance of GA-based systems. It is suggested that directing our efforts towards establishing the interdependencies and interactions between parameters of evolutionary systems will enhance the advancement of this new technology.","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.1997.617394","pdfPath":"/iel3/4879/13462/00617394.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"643","displayPublicationTitle":"EUROMICRO 97.

Therefore, the use of algorithms with a parallel search of feasible schedules seems to be attractive. In turn, Hopfield-type neural networks are suitable to solve complex combinatorial problems, owing to their fast convergence, if analog hardware is implemented. However, these neural networks have associated concepts of sub-optimality and the possibility of unfeasible solutions, which are contrary to the notion of system predictability. The paper presents a systematic procedure to map the scheduling problem onto a neural network in such a way that network solutions are always feasible schedules. Network convergence time is studied with digital computer simulations, using a discrete time model. Global asymptotic consistency between the discrete time model and the continuous one is assured. The paper also presents an analysis of the complexity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/EURMIC.1997.617400","pdfPath":"/iel3/4879/13462/00617400.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"678","displayPublicationTitle":"EUROMICRO 97.

Our algorithm allows operations to occur in different network partitions simultaneously. When the sites from different partitions merge, the algorithm detects and resolves both read-write and write-write conflicts without taking into account the semantics of the transactions. Once the conflicts have been detected some reconciliation steps for the resolution of conflicts have also been proposed.

Countermeasures are discussed that can be taken at the head level, at the head-disk interface level, at the channel electronics level and at the system level. Various forms of electronic abatement are presented. Several methods for generating TI flags are shown. Circuitry for \"cloaking\" the TI events is discussed.

As a new type of (1,7) PRML system, a PR(1,1.5,0,-1.5,-1) system called a modified MEEPR4 (MMEEPR4) which contains a spectral null below the Nyquist frequency is proposed. We compared the performances of 8/9 (0,4,4) PR4, (1,7) EEPR4, (1,7) MEEPR4 and (1,7) MMEEPR4 in recording systems with both electronic and medium noise characterized by Thurlings' model. Medium noise power was corrected using the code magnetic transition probability. Thus the average medium noise power for code-2/3 (1,7) was 20% smaller than that of code-8/9 (0,4,4). To verify the practical use of this system, we defined the broader constraints and calculated the error propagation. It is clear that the (1,7) MEEPR4 system does not satisfy the broader constraints because it generates no quasi-catastrophic trellis sequence. Simulation results indicate that the narrow-band (1,7) MMEEPR4 system provides a significant improvement over 8/9 (0,4,4) PR4 and (1,7) EEPR4 and avoids the signal band extension for a 2/3 code-rate without a loss in performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/13466/00617739.pdf","startPage":"2812","endPage":"2814","doi":"10.1109/20.617739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.617739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New type (1,7) RLL partial response over 5 Gbit/in/sup 2/ areal density","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/617739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"New type (1,7) RLL partial response over 5 Gbit/in/sup 2/ areal density","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712348","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New type (1,7) RLL partial response over 5 Gbit/in/sup 2/ areal density","sourcePdf":"00617739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035635S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","articleId":"617739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":617773,"authors":[{"name":"S.

There are clear definable features and advantages that have a profound impact on the next-generation applications that use SSPCs. The present design of SSPCs has come a long way, but the future brings improvements that will necessitate the use of SSPCs in the next generation of power distribution systems.

As a result, the transition boundaries are no longer sharp and show onset of percolation. The onset of on-track percolation for films deposited at 160/spl deg/C with higher exchange interaction occurs at lower recording density compared to the film deposited at 235/spl deg/C.

Stable detection is realized by detecting prohibited run-length codes and adjusting the decision algorithm to disk recording characteristics. The proposed detection scheme is effective at high linear densities and with tilt phenomena, and this circuit is much smaller than that of the Viterbi detector.","doi":"10.1109/20.617911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13466","startPage":"3262","endPage":"3264","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/13466/00617911.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.617911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple detection method for RLL codes (Run detector) [magneto-optical disk systems]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Intersymbol interference","Viterbi algorithm","Magnetooptic effects","Magnetooptic recording","Image edge detection","Disk recording","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magneto-optical recording","runlength codes","intersymbol interference","error correction codes","signal detection","partial response channels","integrated logic circuits","magnetic recording noise","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magneto-optical disk systems","RLL codes","detection method","edge detection method","run-length limited code","inter-symbol interference","prohibited run-length code detection","decision algorithm","tilt phenomena","high linear densities","Run detector","LSI circuit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A simple detection method for RLL codes (Run detector) [magneto-optical disk systems]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/617911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5719742","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple detection method for RLL codes (Run detector) [magneto-optical disk systems]","sourcePdf":"00617911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029855S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"5","articleId":"617911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":617912,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These audio-coding standards are the first international standards in the field of high-quality digital audio compression. MPEG-1 covers coding of stereophonic audio signals at high sampling rates aiming at transparent quality, whereas MPEG-2 also offers stereophonic audio coding at lower sampling rates. In addition, MPEG-2 introduces multichannel coding with and without backwards compatibility to MPEG-1 to provide an improved acoustical image for audio-only applications and for enhanced television and video-conferencing systems. MPEG-2 audio coding without backwards compatibility, called IMPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), offers the highest compression rates. Typical application areas for MPEG-based digital audio are in the fields of audio production, program distribution and exchange, digital sound broadcasting, digital storage, and various multimedia applications. We describe in some detail the key technologies and main features of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 audio coders. We also present the MPEG-4 standard and discuss some of the typical applications for MPEG audio compression.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Audio coding","Transform coding","ISO standards","Audio compression","Image sampling","Image coding","MPEG standards","Standardization","Standards development","Standards organizations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","Hi-Fi equipment","code standards","telecommunication standards","ISO standards","signal sampling","data compression","channel coding","digital audio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPEG digital audio coding","MPEG audio compression","Moving Pictures Expert Group","International Organization of Standardization","ISO","audio-visual standards","MFEG-1","MPEG-2","audio coding standards","international standards","digital audio compression","stereophonic audio signals","high sampling rates","stereophonic audio coding","multichannel coding","backwards compatibility","audio-only applications","enhanced television systems","videoconferencing systems","IMPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding","MPEG-4 standard","audio coders","digital sound broadcasting"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.618009","startPage":"59","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/13473/00618009.pdf","doi":"10.1109/79.618009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPEG digital audio coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"MPEG digital audio coding","accessionNumber":"5702345","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","volume":"14","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPEG digital audio coding","sourcePdf":"618009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049676S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"106","articleId":"618009","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":618017,"authors":[{"name":"I.

An approach which centers on programmable logic devices is now much more appropriate given their widespread adoption by industry. This can support all standard concepts in combinational and sequential design with the advantage of introducing a technology now standard for implementation. Programmable array logic (PAL) technology appears most suited to an introductory approach since it is low-cost with clear extension to advanced programmable logic techniques; there are many PAL specification (programming) systems and many PAL devices available. There is no ideal \"educational\" PAL since commercial design is a compromise of great complexity. A review of several systems which can be used to specify PAL interconnect (covering PALASM, PLPL, PLACE, ABEL-SE, and MAX+PLUS II) shows that all can support an introductory course, that there is limited standardization, and that there are a number of advantages offered by the more sophisticated packages. Using a programmable approach implies that the academic curriculum can be revised for a new implementation. Such revision is not new in a subject which has demonstrated awesome progress in its short history. The time is now right for programmable logic to give a new interpretation into the appropriate concepts for introducing students to digital design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","volume":"40","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5693609","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On a programmable approach to introducing digital design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On a programmable approach to introducing digital design","sourcePdf":"00618030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079057S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"14","articleId":"618030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":618037,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To understand the contribution of the systematic and the random common mode gains to the overall common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) we studied three op amp topologies, which use N-P complementary input differential pairs. A detailed small signal analysis for each of them has been performed to compare their systematic and random CMRR. The analysis shows that random CMRR caused by mismatch does not depend on the topology, while the systematic CMRR is topology dependent. It is also concluded that the CMRR of low voltage op amps with N-P complementary input pairs will be ultimately limited by the process mismatch and that the random CMRR will determine the overall CMRR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low voltage","Operational amplifiers","Topology","Tail","Rail to rail inputs","Differential amplifiers","Signal analysis","Analog circuits","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","differential amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common mode rejection ratio","low voltage operational amplifiers","complementary N-P input pairs","differential pairs","mismatch errors","tail current switching","random common mode gains","op amp topologies","small signal analysis","random CMRR","systematic CMRR","process mismatch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/82.618045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/13459/00618045.pdf","startPage":"678","endPage":"683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.618045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the common mode rejection ratio in low voltage operational amplifiers with complementary N-P input pairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the common mode rejection ratio in low voltage operational amplifiers with complementary N-P input pairs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618045/","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5682878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the common mode rejection ratio in low voltage operational amplifiers with complementary N-P input pairs","sourcePdf":"00618045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029608S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"12","articleId":"618045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":618050,"authors":[{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Min Li","id":"37366386200"},{"name":"Kuang-Ping Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Kuang-Ping Ma","id":"38183191300"},{"name":"D.M.

In this paper, we first describe a simple exact algorithm for this problem, based on the approach of edge replacement in the minimum spanning tree of G. Next we present polynomial-time randomized algorithms that produce optimal and approximate solutions to this problem. For |V|=n and |E|=m, our algorithm producing optimal solution has a time complexity of O(mn) with probability of success at e/sup -/k/sup 2//2(m-n-1)-2 log/sub c/ k/k-4, c=1+1/2/sup k//2, and the algorithm producing approximate solution runs in time O(mn+nk/sup 2/ log k) and yields results within factor 2 to the optimal one. Finally we show that both of our randomized algorithms can be easily parallelized. On a CREW PRAM, the first algorithm runs in O(n) time using n/sup 2/ processors, and the second algorithm runs in O(log/sup 2/ n) time using mn/log n processors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding the k most vital edges with respect to minimum spanning tree","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1997 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference.

Such systems can be employed to replace standard electronic components, to augment existing systems, or to enable new technologies. In this paper we survey the field of low-power communication systems from the avionics engineering perspective. We review the fundamental merits of optical fiber for information transmission and discuss various information modulation schemes. These modulation techniques naturally determine the performance requirements for laser transmitters. We describe the horizontal- and vertical-cavity semiconductor lasers currently available for these systems, and measure their performance against the additional environmental constraints of avionics platforms. Finally, we outline expected near- and far-term trends in system and device development.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1997 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference.

For all of these techniques, the maximum capacity is achieved when the transmitter varies the data rate sent to each user as their channels vary. This optimal scheme requires channel estimates at the transmitter; dynamic allocation of timeslots, bandwidth, or codes; and variable-rate and power transmission. For both AWGN and fading channels, nonorthogonal code-division with successive decoding has the largest capacity region, while time-division, frequency-division, and orthogonal code-division have the same smaller region. However, when all users have the same average received power, the capacity region for all these techniques is the same. In addition, the optimal nonorthogonal code is a multiresolution code which does not increase the signal bandwidth. Spread-spectrum code-division with successive interference cancellation has a similar rate region as this optimal technique, however, the region is reduced due to bandwidth expansion. We also examine the capacity region of nonorthogonal code-division without interference cancellation and of orthogonal code-division when multipath corrupts the code orthogonality. Our results can be used to bound the spectral efficiency of the downlink channel using time-division, frequency-division, and code-division, both with and without multiuser detection.","doi":"10.1109/25.618181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/13429/00618181.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.618181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of downlink fading channels with variable rate and power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of downlink fading channels with variable rate and power","volume":"46","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5674676","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618181/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of downlink fading channels with variable rate and power","sourcePdf":"00618181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059857S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"77","articleId":"618181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":618182,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

An efficient allocation of resources is the key to high system capacity. In this paper, a distributed dynamic resource allocation (DDRA) scheme based on local signal and interference measurements is proposed for multiuser radio networks. It offers \"soft capacity\" for time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, bounded above by N per base station, where N is the total number of channels in the system. The decisions are made local to a terminal and its base and are essentially independent of the rest of the system. A distributed dynamic channel assignment scheme is used to assign channels to new calls. This scheme assigns a channel that offers the maximum carrier to interference ratio (CIR) to a new call. A distributed constrained power control (DCPC) scheme based on CIR measurements is used for power control. The channel assignment scheme and the power control scheme are coupled to obtain an interactive resource allocation scheme. We compare the capacity of a system which uses the distributed dynamic resource allocation scheme described above with the capacity of a system which uses the channel assignment scheme alone. The system capacity is measured by simulation as the number of terminals that can be served by the system with a CIR above an acceptable minimum. In a 1D cellular system, coupling the channel assignment scheme with power control is discussed.

The design problem is posed as an optimization to obtain the best tradeoff between the expected number of service failures and expected number of handoffs, where a service failure is defined to be the event that the signal strength falls below a level required for satisfactory service to the subscriber. Based on dynamic programming arguments, an optimal solution is obtained, which, though impractical, can be used as a benchmark in the comparison of suboptimal schemes. A simple locally optimal handoff algorithm is derived from the optimal solution. Like the standard hysteresis algorithm, the locally optimal algorithm is characterized by a single threshold. A systematic method for the comparison of various handoff algorithms that are akin to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of radar detection is presented. Simulation results show that the locally optimal algorithm outperforms the hysteresis algorithm, especially in situations where accurate prediction of signal strength is possible. A straightforward technique for adapting the locally optimal algorithm to changing environments is suggested. That natural adaptability is the algorithm's principle advantage over current approaches.","doi":"10.1109/25.618185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/13429/00618185.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.618185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13429","startPage":"603","endPage":"609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A locally optimal handoff algorithm for cellular communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A locally optimal handoff algorithm for cellular communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5674680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A locally optimal handoff algorithm for cellular communications","sourcePdf":"00618185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05627S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"51","articleId":"618185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":618187,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two kinds of demodulation strategies are proposed: a bit-by-bit demodulation algorithm and an efficient demodulation-algorithm frequency-sequence estimation (FSE) based on the Viterbi algorithm.

Expressions for the system bit-error rate (BER) are obtained when the channel is free of fading and when the channel suffers from frequency nonselective (flat) slow Rayleigh fading in the face of additive white Gaussian noise. To arrive at the desired expressions, the probability density function (pdf) of the phase angle between a pair of Gaussian random vectors is used to obtain the probability of bit error conditioned on the channel fading and timing error. The resulting expressions are then averaged over the nonnegligible timing error and the channel fading to arrive at the desired expressions for the system BER. Finally, with the aid of numerical analysis and in the presence of the aforementioned impairments, a number of conclusions are drawn and the performance of differential receivers for DQPSK and /spl pi//4-shifted-DQPSK modulation schemes are compared. It is shown here that the performance of a DQPSK receiver in the absence of fading and timing error is substantially impaired by mixer imbalance for BERs less than 10/sup -4/. In the presence of fading, the performance is noticeably degraded due to mixer imbalance when a nonzero timing error is present.","doi":"10.1109/25.618190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/13429/00618190.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.618190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of DQPSK communication systems impaired by timing error, mixer imbalance, and frequency nonselective slow Rayleigh fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618190/","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of DQPSK communication systems impaired by timing error, mixer imbalance, and frequency nonselective slow Rayleigh fading","volume":"46","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5674685","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of DQPSK communication systems impaired by timing error, mixer imbalance, and frequency nonselective slow Rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"00618190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038772S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","articleId":"618190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":618191,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Wave-propagation models for rural areas consider mainly the influence of topography and often ignore the effects due to land usage in the vicinity of mobile receivers. In some models, this path loss is accounted for either by empirical corrections or by additional knife edges. In this paper, new ray optical approaches for the calculation of the additional path loss for receiver sites within forested and suburban environments are presented. Typical macro situations are defined to describe the RNR. For urban areas, the additional path loss is determined by means of the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), whereas in forested areas, a lateral wave-propagation approach is used. The resulting RNR model is tested in an operating global system for mobile communication (GSM) network. The results show good agreement with both wide- and narrow-band measurements.","doi":"10.1109/25.618199","startPage":"739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/13429/00618199.pdf","endPage":"747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.618199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618199/","displayDocTitle":"The influence of land usage on UHF wave propagation in the receiver near range","volume":"46","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5674694","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of land usage on UHF wave propagation in the receiver near range","sourcePdf":"00618199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04322S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"618199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":618202,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

Our method uses binary probe test data at the wafer level to estimate the size, shape and location of large-area defects or clusters of defective chips.

An important by product of this analysis is a decomposition of wafer yield that attributes defective chips to either large- or small-area defects. Simulation studies show that our procedure is superior to the time-honored windowing technique for achieving a similar breakdown. In addition, by directly estimating defect clusters, we can provide engineers with a greater understanding of the manufacturing process.

For many important applications (e.g., wireless and other high speed technologies), the need for miniaturization requires that these high-speed electrical interconnections be provided on relatively dense PWBs and MCMs. This leads to design uncertainties concerning characteristic impedance and especially crosstalk.

The results also showed that the magnitude of residual stresses in IC packages depended not only on the magnitude of loading but also on the loading history due to the hygro-thermo-viscoelastic behavior of plastic mold compound materials.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/13431/00618224.pdf","doi":"10.1109/96.618224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.618224","startPage":"247","endPage":"255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residual stresses in plastic IC packages during surface mounting process preceded by moisture soaking test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618224/","displayDocTitle":"Residual stresses in plastic IC packages during surface mounting process preceded by moisture soaking test","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5673473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residual stresses in plastic IC packages during surface mounting process preceded by moisture soaking test","sourcePdf":"00618224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046453S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"29","articleId":"618224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":618228,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The objective is to find an optimal policy which maximizes the expected total discounted payoff over the infinite horizon. A stochastic neural network model is suggested for the controller. The parameters of the neural net, which determine a random control strategy, are updated at each instant using a simple learning scheme. This learning scheme involves estimation of some relevant parameters using an adaptive critic.

Then we tune the fuzzy rules, i.e., the slopes of the membership functions, successively until there is no improvement in the recognition rate of the training data. We evaluate our method using the Fisher iris data, numeral data of vehicle license plates, thyroid data, and blood cell data.

In this paper, the adaptive heuristic critic algorithm of Barto et al. (1987) is extended to include a priori control knowledge of human operators.

The passive mesh network could have any topology, with cycles allowed. A technique for calculating the multipath response of the passive mesh network is presented. Both the delay and attenuation of a coaxial cable are represented by a single transform variable. The mesh network is modeled as a linear system with a state space that represents signal propagation. The channel responses of the individual sections of cable define the entries of a state-transition matrix. Using this theory, expressions are given for the overall mesh-network channel response. These expressions are manipulated to derive equalizer structures. The equalizers are zero-forcing and use decision feedback. It is shown that signals transmitted on any mesh network can be equalized. An example mesh topology, and equalizers for it, are presented. Signal and interference attenuation, and opposite-phase received carrier cancellation, are also discussed. The passive mesh network could be an inexpensive fault-tolerant architecture for residential access to telephony, cable TV, and future services.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.618298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/13436/00618298.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"947","doi":"10.1109/26.618298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coaxial cable passive mesh networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Coaxial cable passive mesh networks","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5668050","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coaxial cable passive mesh networks","sourcePdf":"00618298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036994S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","articleId":"618298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":618299,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Therefore, both the transmission power and bandwidth are scarce resources. Artificial power capture is a simple and effective method to exploit the transmission bandwidth to give a higher throughput, but it may consume a larger mean transmission power because some packets are transmitted at higher power. In this paper, we analyze the mean power consumption of artificial power capture, and formulate two capture control problems which regulate the mean power consumption and the throughput. The analysis reveals that, although some packets are transmitted at higher power, artificial power capture has a smaller mean power consumption than the case without capture when the traffic is sufficiently heavy. This is because artificial power capture can significantly increase the probability of successful transmission at heavy traffic, and hence the mean power consumed for successfully transmitting a packet is smaller.","doi":"10.1109/26.618300","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/13436/00618300.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.618300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"957","endPage":"964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mean power consumption of artificial power capture in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Mean power consumption of artificial power capture in wireless networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618300/","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5668052","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean power consumption of artificial power capture in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00618300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049185S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","articleId":"618300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":618311,"authors":[{"name":"Cherng-Shung Hsu","affiliation":["Chung-Shan Institute of Sciences and Technology, Lung Tan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cherng-Shung Hsu","id":"37382928400"},{"name":"V.O.K.

A 10 Gb/s optical duobinary signal can be transmitted over 200 km of standard single-mode fiber (SMF) with 1 dB dispersion penalty. The advantages of the proposed system are confirmed experimentally. The optical duobinary signal was successfully received by the binary IM-DD receiver at the same sensitivity as a binary IM signal. Power penalty due to chromatic dispersion over a 164-km standard SMF was about 1.8 dB at 10 Gb/s.

Their implementation requires only the calculation of a boundary-field value as a function of the local fields and their recent time history. A general method is described, which enables highly accurate calculation of the reflection properties of these boundary conditions for plane-wave incidence. A number of commonly used time-space ABCs are studied, and the technique is verified by way of FDTD simulation. It is demonstrated that the performance of time-space ABCs is substantially degraded by the influence of the finite-mesh discretizations. A technique is described, which enables these discretization inaccuracies to be overcome by correctly choosing the relevant ABC weighting parameters, thus enabling the various boundary conditions to perform precisely as desired. Solutions for these weighting parameters are provided for a number of common boundary conditions such that their absorption characteristics may be precisely configured to suit any level of mesh discretization. As a consequence, a performance equivalence is established amongst all time-space ABCs of the same order.","doi":"10.1109/22.618403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/13457/00618403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.618403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13457","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reflection analysis of FDTD boundary conditions.

The difference-frequency power is coupled out of the photomixer using coplanar waveguide at low frequencies and using log-spiral, dipole, and slot antennas at higher frequencies. Difference-frequency power is limited by the maximum optical-pump power that the photomixer can withstand. Fiber-coupled photomixers were operated at 77 K-a configuration in which they exhibited improved heatsinking and, therefore, withstood higher pump power.

TWPDs can be long for high efficiency without significantly compromising bandwidth. The TWPD is modeled by a terminated section of transmission line with a position-dependent photocurrent source propagating on it at the optical group velocity. A wave model for the transmission line confirms the accuracy of an equivalent-circuit model for electrical wave propagation. The velocity-mismatch impulse and frequency response are determined by absorption coefficient and wave velocities rather than junction capacitance and load resistance. The velocity-mismatch bandwidth limitations can be written in a simple form which elucidates the factors affecting device response, A discretized periodic TWPD is described by the same equations as the fully distributed version.

These goals can be met by a centralized PCS infrastructure using analog fiber-optic links. It is essential that the relationship between optical-link quality in terms of spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and PCS quality of service be accurately quantified so that optical device and other infrastructure design requirements can be determined. This paper presents a comprehensive wireless/optical simulation model which combines wireless system characteristics (such as fading, cochannel interference, diversity, and power control) with the noise and nonlinearities of fiber-optic links. Results of the simulation indicate that representative SFDR requirements for fiber infrastructures in PCS systems are in the 72-83 dB/spl middot/Hz/sup 2/3/ range. The impact of varying environmental characteristics as quantified by distance loss and shadowing variance is between 7-10 dB. A larger distance loss or lower shadowing variance result in lower SFDR requirements. The required automatic gain control (AGC) accuracy decreases as the SFDR increases. These results indicate that either distributed feedback (DFB) or Fabry-Perot (FP) semiconductor laser diodes can be used in the implementation of PCS infrastructures.","doi":"10.1109/22.618441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/13458/00618441.pdf","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.618441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic range requirements for microcellular personal communication systems using analog fiber-optic links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic range requirements for microcellular personal communication systems using analog fiber-optic links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5700664","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic range requirements for microcellular personal communication systems using analog fiber-optic links","sourcePdf":"00618441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02828S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"59","articleId":"618441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":618444,"authors":[{"name":"G.H.

A unique digital control scheme for PWM power conversion, which requires minimized ripple and improved rise/fall response characteristics of the current in the gradient coils (GCs), is proposed and described here. This power processor as an overall system is completely suited to the power amplifier for advanced MRI applications because the output current waves are not restricted to ramped-square waves and can assume any arbitrary waveform. It is expected that the proposed techniques will highly enlarge the diagnostic target and improve the image quality of MRI.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital control","Pulse width modulation","Magnetic resonance imaging","Bridge circuits","Power conversion","Power amplifiers","Coils","RLC circuits","Magnetic circuits","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","switching circuits","bridge circuits","bipolar transistor switches","power bipolar transistors","power semiconductor switches","insulated gate bipolar transistors","harmonic distortion","power system harmonics","switched mode power supplies","power amplifiers","coils","biomedical NMR","biomedical electronics","power supplies to apparatus","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two parallel bridge PWM power conversion circuit","switch-mode gradient power current tracking amplifiers","magnetic resonance imaging","advanced digital control scheme","power IGBT switches","gradient coils","output current waveform","ripple minimisation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PEDS.1997.618756","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Second International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Second International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4887/13474/00618756.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"518 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.1997.618756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced digital control scheme of two-paralleled bridge type current tracking power conversion amplifier for magnetic resonance imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced digital control scheme of two-paralleled bridge type current tracking power conversion amplifier for magnetic resonance imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618756/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5709364","conferenceDate":"26-29 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 May 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced digital control scheme of two-paralleled bridge type current tracking power conversion amplifier for magnetic resonance imaging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00618756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03565S","chronDate":"26-29 May 1997","isNumber":"13474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4887","citationCount":"4","articleId":"618756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":618894,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This method simulates the stuck-at fault model and may also be used for multiple faults and bridging faults. The implementation discussed in this paper is only for SSFs (single stuck-at faults). When tested on combinational circuits using a commercial emulator, speeds varying from a few kHz to several MHz were reached. The efficiency of this form of fault injection is illustrated by the experimental results presented in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping Shortening the Path from Specification to Prototype","pdfPath":"/iel3/4885/13471/00618894.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 8th IEEE International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping Shortening the Path from Specification to Prototype","doi":"10.1109/IWRSP.1997.618894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWRSP.1997.618894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to fault emulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emulation","Circuit faults","Circuit simulation","Circuit testing","Hardware","Computational modeling","Logic circuits","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","logic CAD","combinational circuits","fault diagnosis","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-based fault emulation","fault injection","logic emulator","hardware modules","single stuck-at faults","multiple faults","bridging faults","combinational circuits","commercial emulator","speeds","efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1997","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to fault emulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to fault emulation","confLoc":"Chapel Hill, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00618894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043151S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1997","isNumber":"13471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4885","citationCount":"6","articleId":"618894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":618903,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The authors describe a high-performance neural network that in addition to predicting stock market direction, allows the user to visualize the relationship between current conditions and previous conditions that led to similar predictions. Visualization is accomplished by forming a gated multi-expert network using funnel-shaped multilayer dimensionality reduction networks. The neck of the funnel is a two-neuron layer that displays the training data and the decision boundaries in a two-dimensional space. This architecture facilitates a) interactive design of the decision functions and b) explanation of the relevance of past decisions from the training set to the current decision. They describe a stock market prediction system whose design incorporates a visual neural network for prediction, wavelet transforms and tapped delay lines for feature extraction, and a genetic algorithm for feature selection. This system shows that the visual neural network provides the low error rates (i.e., accurate predictions) of multi-expert networks along with the visual explanatory power of nonlinear dimensionality reduction.","doi":"10.1109/CIFER.1997.618903","pdfPath":"/iel3/4886/13472/00618903.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"49","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFER.1997.618903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network that explains as well as predicts financial market behavior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"A neural network that explains as well as predicts financial market behavior","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5644608","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"24-25 March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network that explains as well as predicts financial market behavior","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00618903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040524S","chronDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4886","citationCount":"4","articleId":"618903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":618923,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Differently, qualitative data and, in particular, articles from on-line news agencies or from financial newspapers are not yet successfully processed. As a result, financial operators suffer from qualitative data-overload. The paper addresses the issue of the use of natural language processing and, in particular, information extraction, for processing qualitative financial data. The financial information extraction system under development at the University of Durham can identify specific kinds of information within a source article, producing a set of relevant templates which represent the most important information in the article and therefore reducing the operators' qualitative data-overload. The application has been designed in close contact with experts of the financial sector and can be fully customized by the user who can add new templates to the existing ones.","doi":"10.1109/CIFER.1997.618923","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4886/13472/00618923.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFER.1997.618923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural language processing and information extraction: qualitative analysis of financial news articles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=618923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618923/","displayDocTitle":"Natural language processing and information extraction: qualitative analysis of financial news articles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5644619","conferenceDate":"24-25 March 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural language processing and information extraction: qualitative analysis of financial news articles","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00618923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053357S","chronDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4886","citationCount":"12","articleId":"618923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":618932,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Using the THONN model, the accuracy is about 5%-10% better than conventional trigonometric polynomial neural network models.","doi":"10.1109/CIFER.1997.618934","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4886/13472/00618934.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFER.1997.618934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Financial simulation system using a higher order trigonometric polynomial neural network group model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling","Graphical user interfaces","Electronic mail","Sun","Workstations","Economic forecasting","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","financial data processing","graphical user interfaces","human factors","data handling","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial simulation system","trigonometric polynomial high order neural network","THONN","C language","user-friendly","graphical user interface","X-Windows","Sun workstation","higher order nonlinear data","discontinuous data","multilayer neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","displayDocTitle":"Financial simulation system using a higher order trigonometric polynomial neural network group model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-25 March 1997","accessionNumber":"5644630","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Financial simulation system using a higher order trigonometric polynomial neural network group model","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00618934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042412S","chronDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4886","citationCount":"8","articleId":"618934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":618940,"authors":[{"name":"E.

New methods such as artificial neural networks replaced traditional approaches which usually were appropriate for linear models only. Nevertheless, there are still applications where accurate estimations of linear processes, such as ARMA models, are sufficient. However, the methods for this class of models were developed more than 20 years ago, with the restrictions of the, then current, computers in mind.

A novel hybrid neural network algorithm for noisy time series prediction is presented which exhibits excellent performance on the problem. The method is motivated by consideration of how neural networks work, and by fundamental difficulties with random correlations when dealing with small sample sizes and high noise data. The method permits the inference and extraction of rules. One of the greatest complaints against neural networks is that it is hard to figure out exactly what they are doing-this work provides one answer for the internal workings of the network. Furthermore, these rules can be used to gain insight into both the real world system and the predictor. The paper focuses on noisy time series prediction and rule inference-use of the system in trading would typically involve the utilization of other financial indicators and domain knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/CIFER.1997.618945","startPage":"253","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFER.1997.618945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13472","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE/IAFE 1997 Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4886/13472/00618945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule inference for financial prediction using recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/618945/","displayDocTitle":"Rule inference for financial prediction using recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5644639","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-25 March 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule inference for financial prediction using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00618945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033908S","chronDate":"23-25 Mar 1997","isNumber":"13472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4886","citationCount":"28","articleId":"618945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":619071,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This transferred knowledge can also be \"tuned\" with and without locking the feature level synaptic weights. We examine the impact and feasibility of sharing (on both levels, with and without locking features) neural network modules trained on actual sonar data in the global self-localization (GSL) problem.

Hydraulic pressure variations in each of three flexible tubes (bellows) in each finger create a bending moment, and consequent motion or increase in contact force during grasping. Such fingers have inherent passive compliance, no moving parts, and are naturally depth pressure-compensated, making them ideal for reliable use in the deep ocean. In addition to the mechanical design, development of the hand has also been considered for closed loop finger position and force control, coordinated finger motion for grasping, force and slip sensor development/signal processing, and reactive world modelling/planning for supervisory \"blind grasping\". Initially, the application focus is for marine science tasks, but broader roles in offshore oil and gas, salvage, and military use are foreseen. Phase I of the project has been completed, with the construction of a first prototype. This paper summarizes the developments in Phase I.

Our mobile robot group has a task to prevent a trespasser from passing along a way in a surveillance area by a group formation. To control the formation, each robot has a formation vector. In particular, the formation is controllable by the vectors. The group encounters various ways and each way has its own width. Moreover, the number of the robots in the group is changed when some of them are broken. However, the group in our control method can make a specified formation to achieve the task, adapting to variations of such conditions. In other words, we prove an existence of a distributed control method that enables the adaptation of the formation.

The emphasis is on developing a robust manipulation process that allows fingers to traverse the surface of an object. The process consists of a sequence of phases in which some fingers are responsible for grasping and manipulating the object while others roll and slide over the object surface. The rolling/sliding fingers can utilize sensors to determine surface properties such as texture, friction or small features such as grooves and ridges. Simulations and experiments with a two-fingered hand were conducted to investigate the robustness of the approach for exploring various object shapes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619334/","accessionNumber":"5679982","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Haptic exploration of objects with rolling and sliding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Haptic exploration of objects with rolling and sliding","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00619334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036079S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"51","articleId":"619334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":619348,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The fault-tolerance measure used is a worst-case quantity, given by the minimum, over all single joint failures, of the minimum singular value of the post-failure Jacobians. Given any end-effector trajectory, the goal is to continuously follow this trajectory with the manipulator in configurations that maximize the fault-tolerance measure. The computation required to track these optimal configurations with brute-force methods is prohibitive for real-time implementation. We address this issue by presenting algorithms that quickly compute estimates of the worst-case fault-tolerance measure and its gradient. Real-time implementations are presented for all these techniques, and comparisons show that the performance of the best is indistinguishable from that of brute-force implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.619352","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13470/00619352.pdf","startPage":"2595","endPage":"2600 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.619352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Real-time failure-tolerant control of kinematically redundant manipulators","volume":"3","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5685092","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619352/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time failure-tolerant control of kinematically redundant manipulators","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00619352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069233S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"7","articleId":"619352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":619358,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The defect tolerance of the RAM is based on a hierarchical redundancy technique employing a self-test and self-reconfiguration logic and is applicable to any standard RAM device. The presented approach is based on a two-level redundancy. Therefore, the memory is split in b smaller RAM blocks of equal size plus one redundant block. Each of those b+1 blocks is equipped with four spare rows and contains a simple self-test logic to detect and mask defects on the lower redundancy level by replacing defective rows. In the last phase of the procedure, b reconfigured (or defect-free) blocks form the RAM on the higher level. This redundancy technique leads to a significant increase in yield with a comparatively low area overhead. Furthermore, only a very moderate delay in the signal path is added so that there is nearly no decrease in the memory's performance.

Test generation for LUTs and RAMs is analyzed and discussed by reducing the number of configurations as primary objective. It is proved that a memory with n inputs and two programmable modes (given by the LUT-mode and the RAM-mode) can be tested using a total of 4n/spl times/2/sup n/ READs and 2n/spl times/2/sup n/ WRITEs in 2n+1 configurations (in practice n/spl Lt/5). The conditions by which constant testability of one-dimensional arrays made of memories in a given mode is possible are presented. Hence, to test n/sub r/ memories with two programmable modes, the number of configurations is given by 3n and the number of tests is 8n/spl times/2/sup n/.

A module decides its outputs through the interaction with other modules, but the module does not share all information of other modules. In addition, the information received from other modules often includes ambiguous and incomplete information. We therefore apply fuzzy theory to represent incomplete information of other modules. Furthermore, we apply a virus-evolutionary genetic algorithm (VEGA) to a fuzzy flow shop scheduling problem with fuzzy transportation time. The VEGA is a stochastic optimization method simulating coevolution of host population and virus population. The simulation results indicate that the fuzzified information is effective when a module has incomplete information in the SOMS.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1997.619472","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1288 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1997.619472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13484","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4864/13484/00619472.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy manufacturing scheduling by virus-evolutionary genetic algorithm in self-organizing manufacturing system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619472/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy manufacturing scheduling by virus-evolutionary genetic algorithm in self-organizing manufacturing system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5698072","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy manufacturing scheduling by virus-evolutionary genetic algorithm in self-organizing manufacturing system","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00619472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064506S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"5","articleId":"619472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":619506,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The exchange coupling was exhibited only for samples with the FeMn film crystallized into the /spl gamma/-phase. The value of an exchange bias field barely depends on the amount of the /spl gamma/-FeMn phase. Even a small amount of the /spl gamma/-FeMn phase localized at the interface can provide a strong enough exchange coupling in the NiFe/FeMn system. The samples deposited on the Ta underlayer at room temperature exhibited the lowest roughness, smallest crystallite size and highest exchange coupling.

Each weight as well as node in the RSONFIN has its own meaning and represents a special element in a fuzzy rule. There are no hidden nodes (i.e., no membership functions and fuzzy rules) initially in the RSONFIN. They are created online via concurrent structure identification (the construction of dynamic fuzzy if-then rules) and parameter identification (the tuning of the free parameters of membership functions). The structure learning together with the parameter learning forms a fast learning algorithm for building a small, yet powerful, dynamic neural fuzzy network.

The proposed multiuser detector is based on spatial-temporal filtering and decision-feedback techniques, hence the name spatial-temporal decorrelating decision-feedback (STDF) detector. An optimum STDF detector is expected to have an exponential complexity as the number of users grow. A suboptimum STDF detector shows a better performance in terms of probability of error (or SNR) and asymptotic efficiency as compared to the other suboptimum detectors. Simulation results under diverse channel conditions show that STDF is a bandwidth efficient technique, which is an essential requirement for modern wireless communications. Also the results indicate that STDF performance gains are more significant for relatively weak users.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1997.619894","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/4892/13485/00619894.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1997.619894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13485","startPage":"22","endPage":"27 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-temporal decorrelating decision-feedback multiuser detector for synchronous code-division multiple-access channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=619894","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-temporal decorrelating decision-feedback multiuser detector for synchronous code-division multiple-access channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619894/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-temporal decorrelating decision-feedback multiuser detector for synchronous code-division multiple-access channels","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00619894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037799S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","citationCount":"1","articleId":"619894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":619936,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The performance of a maximal-ratio combiner with finite tap decisions (M-MRC), and the optimum linear diversity combiner (L-MRC) which combines all the L resolvable multipaths, is also evaluated for comparison. The results reveal that M-SCMRC outperforms M-MRC, although the combination of a strong specular component and a heavily decayed multipath intensity profile may result in only a minimal degradation of the receiver performance for an M-MRC RAKE receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5745666","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of predetection diversity techniques for RAKE receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of predetection diversity techniques for RAKE receivers","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00619942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036524S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","citationCount":"13","articleId":"619942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":619968,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is known that a system of dual loops improves the instability and suppresses the steady-state error of a third-order PLL. A conventional third-order PLL using dual loops is implemented by digital equipment. Since the digital PLL cannot be used in the high frequency band in satellite communications because of limitations of the operational frequency, conventional third-order PLL using dual loops are unavailable in such an environment. In this paper, we propose a new third-order PLL using dual loops which are implemented by analog equipment. We investigate the transient response and the steady-state behavior of the proposed PLL due to the frequency ramp transition. Results show that the steady-state phase error of the proposed PLL is suppressed. Furthermore, we show that the stability of the proposed PLL is better than that of the typical third-order PLL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Third-order phase-locked loops using dual loops with improved stability","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1997.619968","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/4892/13485/00619968.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"341 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1997.619968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=619968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/619968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Third-order phase-locked loops using dual loops with improved stability","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745691","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Third-order phase-locked loops using dual loops with improved stability","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00619968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039052S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","citationCount":"7","articleId":"619968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":619976,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.
