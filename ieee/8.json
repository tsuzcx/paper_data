He considers the performance of a number of software spin-waiting algorithms. Arbitration for control of a lock is in many ways similar to arbitration for control of a network connecting a distributed system. He applies several of the static and dynamic arbitration methods originally developed for networks to spin locks. A novel method is proposed for explicitly queueing spinning processors in software by assigning each a unique number when it arrives at the lock.

The authors describe in detail several optimal implementations of algorithms given for one-way one- and two-dimensional systolic arrays. Since interprocessor communication is many times slower than local computation in parallel computers built to date, the problem of efficient communication is specifically addressed for these mappings. In order to validate the technique experimentally, five systolic algorithms were mapped in various ways onto a 64-node NCUBE/7 MIMD hypercube machine. The algorithms are for the following problems: the shuffle scheduling problem, finite impulse response filtering, linear context-free language recognition, matrix multiplication, and computing the Boolean transitive closure. Experimental evidence indicates that good performance is obtained for the mappings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.80124","startPage":"48","endPage":"63","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2627/00080124.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.80124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On mapping systolic algorithms onto the hypercube","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hypercubes","Systolic arrays","Concurrent computing","Computer architecture","Scheduling algorithm","Filtering algorithms","Processor scheduling","Finite impulse response filter","Nonlinear filters","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","computational complexity","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel to parallel mappings","performance evaluation","time-space graph","one way linear systolic array","systolic algorithms","hypercube","systolic array algorithms","fixed-size hypercube architecture","two-dimensional systolic arrays","interprocessor communication","local computation","parallel computers","64-node NCUBE/7 MIMD hypercube machine","shuffle scheduling problem","finite impulse response filtering","linear context-free language recognition","matrix multiplication","Boolean transitive closure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"On mapping systolic algorithms onto the hypercube","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3665566","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On mapping systolic algorithms onto the hypercube","sourcePdf":"00080124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032807S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"2627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"25","articleId":"80124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":80128,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Two types of move are allowed: cell exchanges and cell displacements. The computation of the cost function in parallel among all the processors in the hypercube is described, along with a distributed data structure that needs to be stored in the hypercube to support such a parallel cost evaluation. A novel tree broadcasting strategy is presented for the hypercube that is used extensively in the algorithm for updating cell locations in the parallel environment. A dynamic parallel annealing schedule is proposed that estimates the errors due to interacting parallel moves and adapts the rate of synchronization automatically. Two novel approaches in controlling error in parallel algorithms are described: heuristic cell coloring and adaptive sequence control.

The tasks are characterized by worst-case computation times, deadlines, and resources requirements. Starting with an empty partial schedule, each step of the search extends the current partial schedule by including one of the tasks yet to be scheduled. The heuristic functions used in the algorithm actively direct the search for a feasible schedule, i.e. they help choose the task that extends the current partial schedule. Two scheduling algorithms are evaluated by simulation. To extend the current partial schedule, one of the algorithms considers, at each step of the search, all the tasks that are yet to be scheduled as candidates. The second focuses its attention on a small subset of tasks with the shortest deadlines. The second algorithm is shown to be very effective when the maximum allowable scheduling overhead is fixed. This algorithm is hence appropriate for dynamic scheduling in real-time systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.80146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2628/00080146.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.80146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"184","endPage":"194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient scheduling algorithms for real-time multiprocessor systems","volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3683383","publicationDate":"April 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient scheduling algorithms for real-time multiprocessor systems","sourcePdf":"00080146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053917S","chronDate":"Apr 1990","isNumber":"2628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"232","articleId":"80146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":80155,"authors":[{"name":"V.W.

The state of the art in data dependence analysis and some parallel execution techniques are examined. The major findings are included. Many subscripts contain symbolic terms with unknown values. A few methods of determining their values at compile time are evaluated. Array references with coupled subscripts appear quite frequently; these subscripts must be handled simultaneously in a dependence test, rather than being handled separately as in current test algorithms. Nonzero coefficients of loop indexes in most subscripts are found to be simple: they are either 1 or -1. This allows an exact real-valued test to be as accurate as an exact integer-valued test for one-dimensional or two-dimensional arrays. Dependencies with uncertain distance are found to be rather common, and one of the main reasons is the frequent appearance of symbolic terms with unknown values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.80162","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"356","endPage":"364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2629/00080162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.80162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical study of Fortran programs for parallelizing compilers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Data analysis","Testing","Scheduling","Statistics","US Department of Energy","NASA","Councils","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FORTRAN","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array references","Fortran programs","parallelizing compilers","program characteristics","data dependence analysis","program transformations","integer-valued test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"An empirical study of Fortran programs for parallelizing compilers","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3728161","publicationDate":"July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80162/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical study of Fortran programs for parallelizing compilers","sourcePdf":"00080162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0514S","chronDate":"Jul 1990","isNumber":"2629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"81","articleId":"80162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":80185,"authors":[{"name":"I.D.

The idea is based on a definition of orthogonal binary vectors and leads to a construction rule for a class of orthogonal graphs. An orthogonal graph is first defined as a set of 2/sup m/ nodes, which in turn are linked by 2/sup m-n/ edges for every link model defined in an integer set Q*. The degree and diameter of an orthogonal graph are determined in terms of the parameters n, m, and the number of link modes defined in Q*. Routing in orthogonal graphs is shown to reduce to the node covering problem in bipartite graphs. The proposed theory is applied to describe a number of well-known interconnection networks such as the binary m-cube and spanning-bus meshes. Multidimensional access (MDA) memories are also shown as examples of orthogonal shared memory multiprocessing systems. Finally, orthogonal graphs are applied to the construction of multistage interconnection networks. Connectivity and placement rules are given and shown to yield a number of well-known networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.80185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2631/00080185.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.80185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal graphs for the construction of a class of interconnection networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal graphs for the construction of a class of interconnection networks","volume":"2","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3883783","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80185/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal graphs for the construction of a class of interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"00080185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041214S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"31","articleId":"80185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":80187,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The hardware overhead is almost 1/n, n being the dimensionality of the hypercube, which is negligible for large n. For this new design, optimal routing algorithms are developed and proven to be remarkably more efficient than those of the conventional n-cube. For one-to-one communication, each node can reach any other node in the network in at most (n/2) hops (each hop corresponds to the traversal of a single link), as opposed to n hops in the standard hypercube. One-to-all communication (broadcasting) can also be performed in only (n/2) steps, yielding a 50% improvement in broadcasting time over that of the standard hypercube. All routing algorithms are simple and easy to implement. Correctness proofs for the algorithms are given. For the proposed architecture, communication parameters such as average distance, message traffic density, and communication time delay are derived. In addition, some fault tolerance capabilities of this architecture are quantified and compared to those of the standard cube. It is shown that this structure offers substantial improvement over existing hypercube-type networks in terms of the above-mentioned network parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Properties and performance of folded hypercubes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.80187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2631/00080187.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.80187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2631","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Properties and performance of folded hypercubes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3883785","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties and performance of folded hypercubes","sourcePdf":"00080187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045445S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"269","articleId":"80187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":80188,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Thus, it allows for integrated, on-chip learning in large analog and optical networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-free distributed learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.80205","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2632/00080205.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2632","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"Model-free distributed learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3665552","pubMedId":"18282823","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-free distributed learning","sourcePdf":"00080205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038016S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"2632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"42","articleId":"80205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":80206,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In representative computer simulations, multiple training has been shown to lead to an improvement over the original Kosko strategy for recall of multiple pairs as well. A sufficient condition for a correlation matrix to make the energies of the training pairs be local minima is discussed.

Both methods involve one-pass learning algorithms that can be implemented directly in parallel neural network architectures. The performances of the two methods are compared with multipass backpropagation networks, and relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. PNN and the polynomial Adaline are complementary techniques because they implement the same decision boundaries but have different advantages for applications. PNN is easy to use and is extremely fast for moderate-sized databases. For very large databases and for mature applications in which classification speed is more important than training speed, the polynomial equivalent can be found.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3665557","pubMedId":"18282828","publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic neural networks and the polynomial Adaline as complementary techniques for classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic neural networks and the polynomial Adaline as complementary techniques for classification","sourcePdf":"00080210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033333S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"2632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"354","articleId":"80210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":80212,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

This network incorporates learning, which adds failure tolerance; the network is able to modify its connection weights an internal representation so that spare neurons can replace neurons which fail. A brief review of trellis-coding concepts is included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80228","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2633/00080228.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis codes, receptive fields, and fault tolerant, self-repairing neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","displayDocTitle":"Trellis codes, receptive fields, and fault tolerant, self-repairing neural networks","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3704161","pubMedId":"18282833","publicationDate":"June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis codes, receptive fields, and fault tolerant, self-repairing neural networks","sourcePdf":"00080228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030378S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"2633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"21","articleId":"80228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":80229,"authors":[{"name":"O.K.

Between two stages there is a nonlinear transformation of input vectors rejected by the previous stage. The new architecture has many desirable properties, such as optimized system complexity (in the sense of minimized self-organizing number of stages), high classification accuracy, minimized learning and recall times, and truly parallel architectures in which all stages operate simultaneously without waiting for data from other stages during testing.

The dynamic equation is shown to be equivalent to a projection of the input vector onto this subspace. In the case of content-addressable memory, it is shown that spurious fixed points can occur at any corner of the hypercube that is on or near the subspace spanned by the memory vectors. Analysed is why the network can frequently converge to an invalid solution when applied to the traveling salesman problem energy function. With these expressions, the network can be made robust and can reliably solve the traveling salesman problem with tour sizes of 50 cities or more.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2633/00080232.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theoretical investigation into the performance of the Hopfield model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1990","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical investigation into the performance of the Hopfield model","volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3704165","pubMedId":"18282837","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80232/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical investigation into the performance of the Hopfield model","sourcePdf":"00080232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026793S","chronDate":"June  1990","isNumber":"2633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"299","articleId":"80232","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80233,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The proposed neural network is significantly different in architecture and connectivity from previous models. Its emphasis is on high parallelism and modularity. The network connectivity is enriched by recurrent connections within the modules. Each module is, effectively, a Hopfield net. Connections within a module are plastic and are modified by associative learning. Connections between modules are fixed and thus not subject to learning. Although the network is tested with character recognition, it cannot be directly used as such for real-world applications. It must be incorporated as a module in a more complex structure. The architectural principles of the proposed network model can be used in the design of other modules of a whole system. Its architecture is such that it constitutes a good mathematical prototype to analyze the properties of modularity, recurrent connections, and feedback. The model does not make any contribution to the subject of learning in neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3750526","pubMedId":"18282844","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The design of a neural network with a biologically motivated architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of a neural network with a biologically motivated architecture","sourcePdf":"00080250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074008S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"11","articleId":"80250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":80251,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices, no two of which are adjacent. A maximum independent set is an independent set whose cardinality is the largest among all independent sets of a graph.

The proposed system, composed of an n neural network array (where n is the number of edges in the circle graph of the number of possible base pairs), not only generates a near-maximum independent set but also predicts the secondary structure of ribonucleic acids within several hundred iteration steps. The simulator discovered several solutions which are more stable structures, in a sequence of 359 bases from the potato spindle tuber viroid, than previously proposed structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel algorithms","RNA","Backpropagation algorithms","Computational modeling","Sequences","Testing","Shape","Concurrent computing","Neural networks","Organisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","iterative methods","neural nets","parallel algorithms","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary structure prediction","near-maximum independent set","circle graph","parallel algorithm","vertices","cardinality","ribonucleic acids","RNA","neural network array","edges","base pairs","iteration steps","stable structures","potato spindle tuber viroid"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80251","startPage":"263","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2634/00080251.pdf","doi":"10.1109/72.80251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel algorithms for finding a near-maximum independent set of a circle graph","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Parallel algorithms for finding a near-maximum independent set of a circle graph","accessionNumber":"3750527","pubMedId":"18282845","publicationDate":"Sept. 1990","volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel algorithms for finding a near-maximum independent set of a circle graph","sourcePdf":"00080251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046578S","chronDate":"Sept.  1990","isNumber":"2634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"46","articleId":"80251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":80265,"authors":[{"name":"N.E.

The behavior of a single decision-maker containing a neural network is studied in a random environment using reinforcement learning. The objective is to determine the optimal action corresponding to a particular state. Since decisions have to be made throughout the context space based on a countable number of experiments, generalization is inevitable. Many different approaches can be followed to generate the desired discriminant function. Three different methods which use neural networks are discussed and compared. In the most general method, the output of the network determines the probability with which one of the actions is to be chosen. The weights of the network are updated on the basis of the actions and the response of the environment. The extension of similar concepts to decentralized decision-making in a context space is also introduced. Simulation results are included. Modifications in the implementations of the most general method to make it practically viable are also presented. All the methods suggested are feasible and the choice of a specific method depends on the accuracy desired as well as on the available computational power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80288","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080288.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative learning in random environments using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Associative learning in random environments using neural networks","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3883762","pubMedId":"18276348","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative learning in random environments using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00080288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049848S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"17","articleId":"80288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":80290,"authors":[{"name":"S.-C.

An upper bound is given for realizing binary-valued functions that are related to pattern-classification problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80290","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080290.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"55","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on the number of hidden neurons in multilayer perceptrons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on the number of hidden neurons in multilayer perceptrons","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3883764","pubMedId":"18276350","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on the number of hidden neurons in multilayer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00080290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036236S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"257","articleId":"80290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":80292,"authors":[{"name":"L.X.

The structured network is a multilayer feedforward network composed of linear summers in which the weights of these summers have a clear physical meaning. The first level is composed of random access memory units, which are used to control the connectivities of the second-level summers. The second level is composed of three layers of linear summers in which the weight of any summer represents the moving-average parameter to be estimated. The connectivities among these summers are controlled by the first-level memory units in such a way that the outputs of the second-level structured network equal the desired second-order or third-order statistics if the summer weights equal their corresponding true moving-average parameter values. Each second-order and third-order cumulant is viewed as a pattern which the structured network needs to learn, and a steepest-descent algorithm is proposed for training the structured network.

The proposed scheme is a coarse-to-fine search process, and a Hopfield network is used at each stage. Compared with conventional object-matching schemes, the proposed technique provides a more general and compact formulation of the problem and a solution more suitable for parallel implementation. At the coarse search stage, the surface matching scores between the input image and each object model in the database are computed through a Hopfield network and are used to select the candidates for further consideration. At the fine search stage, the object models selected from the previous stage are fed into another Hopfield network for vertex matching. The object model that has the best surface and vertex correspondences with the input image is finally singled out as the best matched model. Experimental results are reported using both synthetic and real range images to corroborate the proposed theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80293","startPage":"84","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080293.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical multiple-view approach to three-dimensional object recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80293/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical multiple-view approach to three-dimensional object recognition","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3883766","pubMedId":"18276353","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical multiple-view approach to three-dimensional object recognition","sourcePdf":"00080293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049517S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"72","articleId":"80293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":80294,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Tracking accuracy is a function of the controller's ability to compensate for disturbances produced by dynamical interactions between the links. A model-based control algorithm uses a nominal model of those dynamical interactions to reduce the disturbances. The problem is how to provide accurate dynamics information to the controller in the presence of payload uncertainty and modeling error. Neural network payload estimation uses a series of artificial neural networks to recognize the payload variation associated with a degradation in tracking performance. The network outputs are combined with a knowledge of nominal dynamics to produce a computationally efficient direct form of adaptive control. The concept is validated through experimentation and analysis on the first three links of a PUMA-560 manipulator. A multilayer perceptron architecture with two hidden layers is used. Integration of the principles of neural network pattern recognition and model-based control produces a tracking algorithm with enhanced robustness to incomplete dynamic information. Tracking efficacy and applicability to robust control algorithms are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80294","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080294.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network payload estimation for adaptive robot control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network payload estimation for adaptive robot control","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3883767","pubMedId":"18276354","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network payload estimation for adaptive robot control","sourcePdf":"00080294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068096S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"35","articleId":"80294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":80295,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

A layered perceptron partially trained for binary classification is considered. The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points.

Expectations for network outputs in such cases are weighted least-squares approximations to a posteriori probabilities for the classes, which justifies interpretation of network outputs as indicating degree of confidence in class membership.

This analysis is pertinent to the area of VLSI-based network implementations with analog weight storage. The results show that, if weight decay is unavoidable, bipolar decay achieves an order-of-magnitude better performance than unipolar and that the weight resolution required in actual implementations of feedforward, connectionist hardware is higher than predicted by computer simulations of network responses to random or Gaussian weight perturbations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080308.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","startPage":"168","endPage":"170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weight decay and resolution effects in feedforward artificial neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weight decay and resolution effects in feedforward artificial neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3883779","pubMedId":"18276368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weight decay and resolution effects in feedforward artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00080308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070136S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"15","articleId":"80308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80309,"authors":[{"name":"F.M.A. Salam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"F.M.A.","lastName":"Salam","id":"37328099700"},{"name":"S.

In contrast to most neural approaches to combinatorial optimization based on quadratic energy cost function, the authors propose to use linear cost functions. As a result, the network complexity (number of neurons and the number of resistive interconnections) grows only linearly with problem size, and large-scale implementations become possible. The proposed approach is related to the linear programming network described by D.W. Tank and J.J. Hopfield (1985), which also uses a linear cost function for a simple optimization problem. It is shown how to map a difficult constraint-satisfaction problem onto a simple neural net in which the number of neural processors equals the number of subjobs (operations) and the number of interconnections grows linearly with the total number of operations. Simulations show that the authors' approach produces better solutions than existing neural approaches to job-shop scheduling, i.e. the traveling salesman problem-type Hopfield approach and integer linear programming approach of J.P.S. Foo and Y. Takefuji (1988), in terms of the quality of the solution and the network complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.80311","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2636","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2636/00080311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to job-shop scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80311/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to job-shop scheduling","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3883782","pubMedId":"18276371","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to job-shop scheduling","sourcePdf":"00080311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047264S","chronDate":"Jan.  1991","isNumber":"2636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"59","articleId":"80311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":80329,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

Several general issues are raised, and generic methods appraised, for pulsed encoding, arithmetic, and intercommunication schemes. Two contrasting synapse designs are presented and compared. The first is based on a fully analog computational form in which the only digital component is the signaling mechanism itself-asynchronous, pulse-rate encoded digital voltage pulses. In this circuit, multiplication occurs in the voltage/current domain. The second design uses more conventional digital memory for weight storage, with synapse circuits based on pulse stretching. Integrated circuits implementing up to 15000 analog, fully programmable synaptic connections are described.

Since they are based on two-layer recurrent neural networks and their operations depend on the correlation measure, these associative memories are called recurrent correlation associative memories (RCAMs). The RCAMs are shown to be asymptotically stable in both synchronous and asynchronous (sequential) update modes as long as their weighting functions are continuous and monotone nondecreasing. In particular, a high-capacity RCAM named the exponential correlation associative memory (ECAM) is proposed. The asymptotic storage capacity of the ECAM scales exponentially with the length of memory patterns, and it meets the ultimate upper bound for the capacity of associative memories. The asymptotic storage capacity of the ECAM with limited dynamic range in its exponentiation nodes is found to be proportional to that dynamic range. Design and fabrication of a 3-mm CMOS ECAM chip is reported. The prototype chip can store 32 24-bit memory patterns, and its speed is higher than one associative recall operation every 3 mu s. An application of the ECAM chip to vector quantization is also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent correlation associative memories","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.80338","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/2637/00080338.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.80338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent correlation associative memories","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3924022","pubMedId":"18276381","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent correlation associative memories","sourcePdf":"00080338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061121S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"100","articleId":"80338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":80339,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.

However, if the input data are drawn from a high-dimensional space, the number of required basis functions grows exponentially with dimension, leading many to suggest the use of adaptive nonlinear basis functions whose parameters can be determined by iterative methods. The author proposes a technique based on the idea that for most of the data, only a few dimensions of the input may be necessary to compute the desired output function. Additional input dimensions are incorporated only where needed. The learning procedure grows a tree whose structure depends upon the input data and the function to be approximated. This technique has a fast learning algorithm with no local minima once the network shape is fixed, and it can be used to reduce the number of required measurements in situations where there is a cost associated with sensing. Three examples are given: controlling the dynamics of a simulated planar two-joint robot arm, predicting the dynamics of the chaotic Mackey-Glass equation, and predicting pixel values in real images from pixel values above and to the left.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3924023","pubMedId":"18276382","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"2","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"A tree-structured adaptive network for function approximation in high-dimensional spaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tree-structured adaptive network for function approximation in high-dimensional spaces","sourcePdf":"00080339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035133S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"95","articleId":"80339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":80341,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A common learning algorithm for radial basis function networks is based on first choosing randomly some data points as radial basis function centers and then using singular-value decomposition to solve for the weights of the network. Such a procedure has several drawbacks, and, in particular, an arbitrary selection of centers is clearly unsatisfactory. The authors propose an alternative learning procedure based on the orthogonal least-squares method. The procedure chooses radial basis function centers one by one in a rational way until an adequate network has been constructed. In the algorithm, each selected center maximizes the increment to the explained variance or energy of the desired output and does not suffer numerical ill-conditioning problems. The orthogonal least-squares learning strategy provides a simple and efficient means for fitting radial basis function networks. This is illustrated using examples taken from two different signal processing applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3924025","pubMedId":"18276384","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal least squares learning algorithm for radial basis function networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal least squares learning algorithm for radial basis function networks","sourcePdf":"00080341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028109S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"2450","articleId":"80341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":80342,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

The decision surface mapping method (DSM) is a fast supervised learning algorithm and is a member of the LVQ family of algorithms.

The training set is then used to adapt these prototypes to map the decision surface separating the classes. This algorithm is compared with NN pattern classification, learning vector quantization, and a two-layer perceptron trained by error backpropagation. When the class boundaries are sharply defined (i.e., no classification error in the training set), the DSM algorithm outperforms these methods with respect to error rates, learning rates, and the number of prototypes required to describe class boundaries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3924028","pubMedId":"18276387","volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive nearest neighbor pattern classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive nearest neighbor pattern classification","sourcePdf":"00080344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017673S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"86","articleId":"80344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":80495,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The efficiency and accuracy of these formulations are examined by comparison with measured data for rectangular and nonrectangular plates. The latter method is found to provide a more accurate computation of the plate scattering by eliminating aliasing errors (other than those due to undersampling).

Elementary cells in this circuit family can generate, pass, memorize, and reproduce picosecond voltage pulses with a nominally quantized area corresponding to transfer of a single magnetic flux quantum across a Josephson junction. Functionally, each cell can be viewed as a combination of a logic gate and an output latch (register) controlled by clock pulses, which are physically similar to the signal pulses. Hand-shaking style of local exchange by the clock pulses enables one to increase complexity of the LSI RSFQ systems without loss of operating speed. The simplest components of the RSFQ circuitry have been experimentally tested at clock frequencies exceeding 100 GHz, and an increase of the speed beyond 300 GHz is expected as a result of using an up-to-date fabrication technology. This review includes a discussion of possible future developments and applications of this novel, ultrafast digital technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","volume":"1","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3895273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub-terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSFQ logic/memory family: a new Josephson-junction technology for sub-terahertz-clock-frequency digital systems","sourcePdf":"00080745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141489S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"1414","articleId":"80745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":80761,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

These are written in a language called grammar specification language (GSL). The compiler has a preprocessing (macroexpansion) phase, a parse phase, graph code generation and compilation phases, and three optimization phases. Digraphs can also be linked together by a graph linker to form larger digraphs. Language complexity is analyzed in a statistics phase. It is demonstrated that the optimization phase yields graphs with even greater efficiency than previously achieved by hand. Some preliminary speech recognition results of applying these techniques to intermediate and large graphs are discussed. With the introduction of these tools it is now possible to provide a speech recognition user with the ability to define new task grammars in the field. GSL has been used by several untutored users with good results. Experience with GSL indicates that it is a viable medium for quickly and accurately defining grammars for use in connected speech recognition systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3905264","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A grammar compiler for connected speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A grammar compiler for connected speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00080761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050687S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"80761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":80762,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The continuous variable duration model was trained using 450 sentences of fluent speech, each of which was spoken by a single speaker, and segmented and labeled using a fixed number of phonemes, each of which has a direct correspondence to the states of the matrix. The inherent variability of each phoneme is modeled as the observable random process of the Markov chain, while the phonotactic model of the unobservable phonetic sequence is represented by the state transition matrix of the hidden Markov model. The model assumes that the observed spectral data were generated by a Gaussian source.

The approach involves modeling the extrapolation process as a linear, time-varying (LTV) system, or filter. Together with a previously developed Fourier theory for LTV systems, this model provides a frequency-domain transfer function representation for the extrapolation system. This representation serves as a powerful tool for characterizing and comparing the reconstruction properties of several well-known least squares optimal algorithms for band-limited extrapolation. Moreover, the frequency-domain setting provides a conceptually attractive means for understanding the process of extrapolation itself. Additionally, a least squares approximation methodology for designing LTV filters for band-limited extrapolation is developed. The design technique is shown to unify a broad class of algorithms for extrapolating discrete-time data and, further, to provide a means for designing new and improved extrapolation algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time varying systems","Extrapolation","Algorithm design and analysis","Power system modeling","Signal analysis","Signal design","Nonlinear filters","Frequency domain analysis","Transfer functions","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","extrapolation","filtering and prediction theory","frequency-domain analysis","least squares approximations","linear systems","signal processing","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear time varying system","discrete-time band-limited signal extrapolation","noniterative algorithms","filter","Fourier theory","frequency-domain transfer function","least squares optimal algorithms","least squares approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.80765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2655/00080765.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear, time-varying system framework for noniterative discrete-time band-limited signal extrapolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A linear, time-varying system framework for noniterative discrete-time band-limited signal extrapolation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80765/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3905267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear, time-varying system framework for noniterative discrete-time band-limited signal extrapolation","sourcePdf":"00080765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054255S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","articleId":"80765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":80767,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Adaptive implementation is obtained with a simple, fast converging algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80767","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2655/00080767.pdf","startPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An eigenanalysis interference canceler","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80767/","displayDocTitle":"An eigenanalysis interference canceler","volume":"39","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3895281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An eigenanalysis interference canceler","sourcePdf":"00080767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055305S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"218","articleId":"80767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80769,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.M.

A framework for the analysis of the error propagation in FTF algorithms is first developed; within this framework, it is shown that the computationally most efficient 7N form is exponentially unstable. However, by introducing redundancy into this algorithm, feedback of numerical errors becomes possible; a judicious choice of the feedback gains then leads to a numerically stable FTF algorithm with a complexity of 8N multiplications and additions per time recursion.

A least squares formulation, which is an expanded matrix representation of the state space iteration, is adopted to develop an efficient iterative QR triangularization and consecutive data prewhitening formulations. This formulation has advantages in both numerical accuracy and processor utilization efficiency. Moreover, it leads naturally to pipelined architectures such as systolic or wavefront arrays. For an n state and m measurement dynamic system, the SKF triarray design uses n(n+3)/2 processors and requires only 4n+m timesteps to complete one iteration of prewhitened Kalman filtering system. This means a speedup factor of approximately n/sup 2//4 when compared with a sequential processor. Also proposed for the colored noise case are data prewhitening triarrays which offer compatible speedup performance for the preprocessing stage. Based on a comparison of several competing alternatives, the proposed array processor may be considered a most efficient systolic or wavefront design for Kalman filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80775","startPage":"171","endPage":"182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2655/00080775.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic array designs for Kalman filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systolic arrays","Kalman filters","Filtering","Covariance matrix","Least squares methods","Radar signal processing","Time measurement","State-space methods","Least squares approximation","Colored noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised signal processing","filtering and prediction theory","iterative methods","Kalman filters","least squares approximations","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic arrays","Kalman filtering","triangular array","least squares formulation","state space iteration","iterative QR triangularization","consecutive data prewhitening formulations","numerical accuracy","processor utilization efficiency","pipelined architectures","wavefront arrays","triarray design","colored noise","speedup performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"Systolic array designs for Kalman filtering","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3905276","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic array designs for Kalman filtering","sourcePdf":"00080775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031477S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","articleId":"80775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":80779,"authors":[{"name":"L.-W.

Conventional approaches for solving this problem generally consist of two steps: calibrating sensor locations and then performing bearing estimation based on the calibrated sensor locations. Approaches to carrying out bearing estimation based on the Toeplitz and eigenstructure reconstruction of the covariance matrix without the need for calibration are proposed. The Toeplitz approximation method (TAM) and a modification of it (MTAM) are used to reconstruct a matrix with Toeplitz structure. To further enhance the capabilities of the TAM and MTAM, an iterative algorithm incorporating with the TAM (ITAM) and the MTAM (IMTAM) is proposed to iteratively reconstruct both the Toeplitz and the desired eigenstructure from the observed covariance matrix. Computer simulations show that the MTAM is more effective than the TAM.

Estimates of target angles are obtained by minimizing the norm of an error matrix function involving the covariance of the sensor outputs. The algorithm yields estimates that are automatically correctly associated with previous estimates. Consequently, the data association problem does not arise, and this results in a much more efficient scheme in comparison to existing methods involving search over N factorial possible measurement/target associations (where N is the number of targets). Performance of the algorithm is illustrated by a simulation example.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for tracking the angles of arrival of moving targets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.80796","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2655/00080796.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1991","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algorithm for tracking the angles of arrival of moving targets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1991","accessionNumber":"3895294","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algorithm for tracking the angles of arrival of moving targets","sourcePdf":"00080796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045179S","chronDate":"Jan 1991","isNumber":"2655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"80796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80798,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The algorithm performs all functions simultaneously, namely, time alignment, work boundary detection, recognition, and parsing. As a result, no postprocessing is required. From the probabilistic point of view, the algorithm finds the most likely explanation or derivation for the observed input string, which amounts to Viterbi scoring rather than Baum-Welch scoring in the case of regular or finite-state languages.

Threshold decomposition and the stacking property together establish a unique relationship between integer and binary domain filtering. The authors present a method to find the weighted median filter which is equivalent to a stack filter defined by a positive Boolean function. Because the cascade of WM filters can always be expressed as a single stack filter this allows expression of the cascade of WM filters as a single WM filter. A direct application is the computation of the output distribution of a cascade of WM filters. The same method is used to find a nonrecursive expansion of a recursive WM filter. As applications of theoretical results, several interesting deterministic and statistical properties of WM filters are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80823","endPage":"410","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00080823.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2656/00080823.pdf","startPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the properties of median and weighted median filters using threshold logic and stack filter representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80823/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the properties of median and weighted median filters using threshold logic and stack filter representation","volume":"39","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3924308","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the properties of median and weighted median filters using threshold logic and stack filter representation","sourcePdf":"00080823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044103S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"250","articleId":"80823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80824,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This method, called discrete all-pole (DAP) modeling, uses a discrete version of the Itakura-Saito distortion measure as its error criterion. One result is an autocorrelation matching condition that overcomes the limitations of linear prediction and produces better fitting spectral envelopes for spectra that are representable by a relatively small discrete set of values, such as in voiced speech. An iterative algorithm for DAP modeling that is shown to converge to a unique global minimum is presented. Results of applying DAP modeling to real and synthetic speech are also presented. DAP modeling is extended to allow frequency-dependent weighting of the error measure, so that spectral accuracy can be enhanced in certain frequency regions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80824","startPage":"411","endPage":"423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2656/00080824.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2656","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00080824.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete all-pole modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Discrete all-pole modeling","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3924309","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80824/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete all-pole modeling","sourcePdf":"00080824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136635S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"184","articleId":"80824","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":80827,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Time-domain equivalents of focusing are derived based on the least squared error approach for general transformations, and the Taylor series expansion approach for closed-form transformations. The preprocessor is realized by a multichannel digital finite impulse response filter. For diagonal transformations, the problem reduces to implementing different delays at each sensor, which in turn leads to computational simplicity. Various tapped delay line filters for realizing an arbitrary delay are proposed and compared. Simulation results reveal that low-order filter structures in the time domain achieve similar performance to the frequency domain approach, even at detection and resolution thresholds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3924312","displayDocTitle":"Focusing filters for wide-band direction finding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focusing filters for wide-band direction finding","sourcePdf":"00080827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045545S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","articleId":"80827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":80829,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A closed-form solution for the resolution measure is given, and the result is compared to the resolution threshold derived by M. Kaveh and A. J. Barabell (1986) when the covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of snapshots. An approximate expression for the threshold signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is derived for the cases when SIRs are large and the coherent interference and direct arrivals are well separated in spatial frequency.

Derivation based on both the sequence splitting and Kronecker matrix product method are discussed. The sequence splitting approach has the advantage that all the underlying operations are shown clearly, while the matrix product representations are more compact and readily generalized to higher dimensions. The bit reversal operations are placed before the recursive additions so that the recursive operations can be performed in a very regular manner. This greatly simplifies the indexing problem in the software implementation of the algorithms.

As an example, the logic diagram of an 8-point*8-point 2-D DCT using the new 2-D DCT algorithm is generated through a simple procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2656/00080854.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"546","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00080854.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-dimensional fast cosine transform algorithm based on Hou's approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80854/","displayDocTitle":"A two-dimensional fast cosine transform algorithm based on Hou's approach","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3924337","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-dimensional fast cosine transform algorithm based on Hou's approach","sourcePdf":"00080854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08166S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","articleId":"80854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80859,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The feedback-cancellation system described updates the estimated feedback path whenever changes are detected in the feedback behavior. When a change is detected, the normal hearing-aid processing is interrupted, a pseudorandom probe signal is injected into the system, and a set of filter coefficients is adjusted to give an estimate of the feedback path. The hearing aid is then returned to normal operation with the feedback-cancellation filter as part of the system. Two approaches are investigated for computing the filter coefficients: a least-mean square (LMS) adaptive filter and a Wiener filter. Test results are presented for a computer simulation of an in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid. The simulation results indicate that more than 10 dB of cancellation can be obtained and that the Wiener filter is more effective in the presence of strong interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","volume":"39","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3914772","publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feedback cancellation in hearing aids: results from a computer simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback cancellation in hearing aids: results from a computer simulation","sourcePdf":"00080875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040646S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","articleId":"80875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":80876,"authors":[{"name":"N.Z.

The signal is a sinusoid whose frequency is drifting at a constant rate Psi . lt is recovered using an M-tap adaptive predictor. Five principal aspects of the study are presented: the methodology of the analysis; proof of the quasi-deterministic nature of the data-covariance estimate R(k); a new analysis of RLS for an inverse system modeling problem; a new analysis of RLS for a deterministic time-varying model for the optimum filter; and an evaluation of the residual output mean-square error (MSE) resulting from the nonoptimality of the adaptive predictor (the misadjustment) in terms of the forgetting rate ( beta ) of the RLS algorithm. It is shown that the misadjustment is dominated by a lag term of order beta /sup -2/ and a noise term of order beta . Thus, a value beta /sub opt/ exists which yields a minimum misadjustment. It is proved that beta /sub opt/=((M+1) rho Psi /sup 2/)/sup 1/3/, and the minimum misadjustment is equal to (3/4)P/sub n/(M+1) beta /sub opt/, where rho is the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2657/00080878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2657","startPage":"583","endPage":"594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive recovery of a chirped sinusoid in noise.

Exploitation of this property yields an estimation scheme that is nearly as computationally simplistic as the 2D beamspace bearing estimation technique based on sum and difference beams employed in conventional monopulse radar. To provide robustness to the severe signal cancellation occurring across the array when the direct and specular path signals arrive 180 degrees out of phase at the aperture center with roughly equal amplitude, frequency diversity is incorporated into 3D BDML. The coherent signal subspace concept of H. Wang and M.

The authors consider both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimate for image estimation and image restoration. Compound image models consist of several submodels having different characteristics along with an underlying structure model which govern transitions between these image submodels. Two different compound random field models are employed, the doubly stochastic Gaussian (DSG) random field and a compound Gauss-Markov (CGM) random field. The authors present MAP estimators for DSG and CGM random fields using simulated annealing. A fast-converging algorithm called deterministic relaxation, which, however, converges to only a locally optimal MAP estimate, is also presented as an alternative for reducing computational loading on sequential machines. For comparison purposes, the authors include results on the fixed-lag smoothing MMSE estimator for the DSG field and its suboptimal M-algorithm approximation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2657/00080887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2657","startPage":"683","endPage":"697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compound Gauss-Markov random fields for image estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compound Gauss-Markov random fields for image estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3924348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compound Gauss-Markov random fields for image estimation","sourcePdf":"00080887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030344S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"147","articleId":"80887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80888,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

The approaches impose intraframe and interframe constraints on the input speech signal. Properties of the line spectral pair representation of speech allow for an efficient and direct procedure for application of many of the constraint requirements. Substantial improvement over the unconstrained method is observed in a variety of domains. Informed listener quality evaluation tests and objective speech quality measures demonstrate the technique's effectiveness for additive white Gaussian noise. A consistent terminating point of the iterative technique is shown. The current systems result in substantially improved speech quality and linear predictive coding (LPC) parameter estimation with only a minor increase in computational requirements.

A speaker adaptation procedure which is easily integrated into the segmental k-means training procedure for obtaining adaptive estimates of the CDHMM parameters is presented. Some results for adapting both the mean and the diagonal covariance matrix of the Gaussian state observation densities of a CDHMM are reported. The results from tests on a 39-word English alpha-digit vocabulary in isolated word mode indicate that the speaker adaptation procedure achieves the same level of performance as that of a speaker-independent system, when one training token from each word is used to perform speaker adaptation. It shows that much better performance is achieved when two or more training tokens are used for speaker adaptation. When compared with the speaker-dependent system, it is found that the performance of speaker adaptation is always equal to or better than that of speaker-dependent training using the same amount of training data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2658/00080902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2658","startPage":"806","endPage":"814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on speaker adaptation of the parameters of continuous density hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study on speaker adaptation of the parameters of continuous density hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3924354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on speaker adaptation of the parameters of continuous density hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00080902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034216S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"182","articleId":"80902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":80906,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

The iterative procedure developed consists of using a periodogram spectrum estimate obtained from some samples of the signal estimate/extrapolation found at one iteration to define the weight that is used to estimate at the next iteration. This algorithm usually converges in less than 10 iterations to an extrapolation which is characterized as a nonparametric frequency-stationary extension of the data. The frequency resolution and extrapolation length are controlled by the length of a time-domain window used to obtain smooth spectral estimates between iterations. Examples are provided to illustrate the use of the algorithm for interpolation/extrapolation. The examples give comparable results to nonadaptive extrapolation methods without the need for a priori knowledge. For a certain spectral estimation example, the algorithm provides comparable resolution to the parametric methods with more accurate values of the relative strengths of the narrowband components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2658/00080906.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extrapolation and spectral estimation with iterative weighted norm modification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80906/","displayDocTitle":"Extrapolation and spectral estimation with iterative weighted norm modification","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3924358","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extrapolation and spectral estimation with iterative weighted norm modification","sourcePdf":"00080906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038509S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","articleId":"80906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80909,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A perturbation analysis of the CTLS solution is derived, and from it the root mean-square error (RMSE) of the CTLS solution, which is valid for small noise levels, is obtained in closed form. The complex version of the Newton method is derived and applied to determine the CTLS solution.

The asymptotic normality of the multifold eigenvalue estimate is used to derive a prediction formula for the thresholds. Due to the fact that the detection error of the method can be controlled by a parameter t, the performance of the method is superior to the MDL (minimum description length) under low SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and superior to an AIC (Akaike information criterion) under high SNR. The distribution functions of both missing and false alarm errors are evaluated so that the performance of the method can be analyzed and so that t can be chosen.

A frequency-weighted error measure is used to reduce the perceptual loudness of the quantization noise.

It is shown that a special case of the method is equivalent to nesting of FFTs. The application of the method to the case where N has mutually prime factors results in a new interpretation of the permutations characteristic of this class of algorithms. It is shown that the equalization of FFTs leads to results which are different from the widely used intuitive ones. The high efficiency of split-radix FFTs is explained. It is shown that the formulae of the method can be easily adapted for deriving algorithms for the cosine/sine DFT. A set of FFTs that has smaller arithmetical and/or memory complexities than any algorithm known is presented. In particular, a method of deriving split-radix-2/sup s/ FFTs requiring N log/sub 2/ N-3N+4 real multiplications and 3N log/sub 2/ N-3N+4 additions for any s>1 is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2659/00080964.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.80964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The techniques of the generalized fast Fourier transform algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fast Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Minimization methods","Multidimensional systems","Helium","Polynomials","Computational complexity","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFT algorithms","signal processing","FFT nesting","split-radix FFT","split-radix 2/sup s/ FFT","generalized fast Fourier transform algorithm","discrete Fourier transform","equalization","cosine/sine DFT","complexities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"The techniques of the generalized fast Fourier transform algorithm","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3942534","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The techniques of the generalized fast Fourier transform algorithm","sourcePdf":"00080964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038859S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","articleId":"80964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80965,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In practice, the observed signals are contaminated with spatially and temporally colored noise of unknown power spectral density. A cumulant-based approach to these problems is proposed. The cumulants of complex processes are defined, and it is shown that specific 1-D slices of the fourth-order cumulant of the noisy signal for the direction of arrival (DOA) and retrieval of harmonics in noise (RHN) problems are identical to the autocorrelation of a related noiseless signal. Hence correlation-based high-resolution methods may be used with fourth-order cumulants as well.

The methods considered are the deterministic maximum likelihood method (ML), ESPRIT, and a recently proposed multidimensional signal subspace method. These methods are formulated in a subspace-fitting-based framework, which provides insight into their algebraic and asymptotic relations. It is shown that by introducing a specific weighting matrix, the multidimensional signal subspace method can achieve the same asymptotic properties as the ML method. The asymptotic distribution of the estimation error is derived for a general subspace weighting, and the weighting that provides minimum variance estimates is identified. The resulting optimal technique is termed the weighted subspace fitting (WSF) method. Numerical examples indicate that the asymptotic variance of the WSF estimates coincides with the Cramer-Rao bound. The performance improvement compared to the other techniques is found to be most prominent for highly correlated signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80966","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2659/00080966.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor array processing based on subspace fitting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Sensor array processing based on subspace fitting","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3942538","publicationDate":"May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor array processing based on subspace fitting","sourcePdf":"00080966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084668S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"485","articleId":"80966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":80967,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Specifically, an additive rank-k modification corresponding to adding and deleting blocks of data to and from the covariance matrix is considered. An efficient and parallel algorithm which makes use of a generalized spectrum-slicing theorem is derived for computing the eigenvalues. The eigenvector can be computed explicitly in terms of the solution of a much-reduced (k*k) homogeneous Hermitian system. The overall computational complexity is shown to be improved by an order of magnitude from O(N/sup 3/) to O(N/sup 2/k), where N*N is the size of the covariance matrix. It is pointed out that these ideas can be applied to adaptive signal processing applications, such as eigen-based techniques for frequency or angle-of-arrival estimation and tracking. Specifically, adaptive versions of the principal eigenvector method and the total least squares method are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.80968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/2659/00080968.pdf","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.80968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive updating the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=80968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/80968/","displayDocTitle":"Recursive updating the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix","volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3942540","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive updating the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix","sourcePdf":"00080968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041894S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","articleId":"80968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":80969,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

However, the currently known spatial smoothing algorithms not only reduce the effective aperture of the array, but also do not consider the cross correlations of the subarray outputs. An improved spatial smoothing algorithm which can fully utilize the correlations of the array outputs and produce a more stable estimate of the covariance matrix is presented.

The effects on the spectral-correlation characteristics of some basic signal processing operations, such as filtering, product modulation, and time sampling, are examined.

ANNs hold the promise of solving difficult logistics problems such as multiple fault diagnosis, prognostication, changing configurations and environments, and inaccurate diagnosis attributable to incomplete and/or flawed rules. The authors tested three representative ANNs to see which type worked best for the problem considered. The authors chose back propagation (BPN) and counterpropagation (CPN) because they are considered to be two of the more promising pattern matching paradigms. The binary adaptive resonance theory I (ART1) was also chosen because it learns faster than CPN or BPN and has online adaptation (i.e. does not have to be totally retrained every time a new pattern is discovered). Online adaptation is a powerful attribute, allowing new associations to be immediately incorporated into the knowledge base on the flight line or wherever needed. The authors explain the advantages and drawbacks to each network tested and describe how they were trained using historical flight line data. Of the three ANNs examined, ART1 proved to be the most appropriate and was able to produce multiple-symptom-to-multiple-fault diagnoses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.1989.81147","startPage":"351","endPage":"357","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Automatic Testing Conference.The Systems Readiness Technology Conference.

Intensity and phase modulations (IM and PM) are analyzed throughout the locking range where the locked laser is stable. The relaxation oscillation resonance in the IM and PM frequency responses can be dramatically reduced by tuning the injected power and the frequency difference between the master laser and the free-running slave laser. The power spectra under direct modulation are derived throughout the stable locking range. The spreading of the harmonics of the modulated locked laser is strongly affected by the frequency detuning, the injected power, and the injected current modulation. Measurements illustrating the theoretical results are also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81332","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor lasers","Laser tuning","Frequency","Laser theory","Power lasers","Equations","Phase modulation","Laser stability","Resonance","Master-slave"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical modulation","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intensity modulations","injection-locked semiconductor laser","modulation properties","rate equation formalism","phase modulations","locking range","relaxation oscillation resonance","PM frequency responses","injected power","frequency difference","master laser","free-running slave laser","power spectra","harmonics","modulated locked laser","frequency detuning","injected current modulation"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2667/00081332.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.81332","doi":"10.1109/3.81332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation properties of an injection-locked semiconductor laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81332/","displayDocTitle":"Modulation properties of an injection-locked semiconductor laser","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3991442","volume":"27","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation properties of an injection-locked semiconductor laser","sourcePdf":"00081332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048523S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"34","articleId":"81332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81338,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The loaded-line design concept is able to combine the high efficiency of vertical p-i-n-type phase modulators with a velocity-matched 50 Omega structure to obtain very high bandwidth/voltage ratios. At 1150 nm, a bandwidth of 25 GHz for V/sub pi /=4.85 V typically represents the performance. At 1300 nm, the bandwidth is unchanged but the drive voltage is higher by the expected wavelength-ratio factor. Reduced drive voltage can be obtained without bandwidth sacrifice by choosing a wavelength close to the material band edge. Threefold enhancement in AlGaAs at short wavelength is demonstrated (lumped only, to date).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81374/","volume":"27","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3971194","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-speed III-V semiconductor intensity modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed III-V semiconductor intensity modulators","sourcePdf":"00081374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05564S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"182","articleId":"81374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81384,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.D.

The approach is to keep a running accumulation of the far-zone time-domain vector potentials due to the tangential electric and magnetic fields on a closed surface surrounding the scatterer at each time step. At the end of the computation, these vector potentials are converted to time-domain far-zone fields. Many far-zone bistatic directions can be included efficiently during one FDTD computational run. Frequency domain results can be obtained via fast Fourier transform. Wideband results for scattering from a perfectly conducting plate were obtained from a single FDTD computation transformed to the frequency domain, and compared with moment method results. This approach is significantly more efficient than computing many FDTD results using sinusoidally varying excitation if a wide frequency band is of interest. Coupled with recent advances in computing FDTD results for frequency-dependent materials, wideband results for far-zone scattering from targets including frequency-dependent materials can be obtained efficiently.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.81453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2670/00081453.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.81453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2670","startPage":"429","endPage":"433","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00081453.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite-difference time-domain near zone to far zone transformation (electromagnetic scattering)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A finite-difference time-domain near zone to far zone transformation (electromagnetic scattering)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3970849","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite-difference time-domain near zone to far zone transformation (electromagnetic scattering)","sourcePdf":"00081453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054725S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"233","articleId":"81453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81455,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Galindo-Israel et al. (see ibid., vol.AP-35, p.887-96, August 1987) the geometrical optics (GO) principles, constraints, and requirements of the dual- and single-offset-shaped reflector synthesis problem were collected and developed into a set of nonlinear first-order partial differential equations (PDEs). Methods of solving these PDEs numerically were illustrated, as were certain problems that may arise. An extension of the methods by which solutions to the PDEs can be obtained is presented, together with several case examples. These examples are independently analyzed by GO and physical optics diffraction methods. The starting point for the integration over each reflector can be taken on the outer rim, at the center, or at an intermediate point-the intermediate starting point being the more general case. The utility of the speed of this synthesis method is demonstrated. This makes practical the incorporation of the synthesis into a search algorithm that can optimize one or more parameters of the reflector system. As an example, the optimization of the mapping equations for low cross polarization is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3970878","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the theory of the synthesis of offset dual-shaped reflectors-case examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the theory of the synthesis of offset dual-shaped reflectors-case examples","sourcePdf":"00081489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026856S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","articleId":"81489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":81495,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A three-dimensional case is restricted to bodies of revolution (BORs). The two-dimensional case is analogous to the BOR case when the Fourier mode number is zero. The method of moments (MM) is used to solve the CFIE in terms of two integral operators. It is shown that the CFIE formulation yields accurate answers for scattering problems where the scatterer may be internally resonant. The CFIE results were validated using Mie series results and measured data. The junction problem associated with the CFIE-based formulation is explicated, and several geometries with multiple junctions are used to validate the general CFIE formulation. A number of configurations are tested where the penetrable region consisted of a free-space coating. Extensive numerical studies have shown that such limiting cases are sensitive indicators of the stability of MM solutions and allow direct comparison of different configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.81498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"667","endPage":"672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2671/00081498.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.81498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined field integral equation formulation for inhomogeneous two- and three-dimensional bodies: the junction problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integral equations","Geometry","Frequency","Magnetic resonance","Dielectric losses","Permittivity","Permeability","Testing","Conductors","Magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional bodies","inhomogeneous bodies","dielectric regions","electromagnetic scattering","internally resonant scatterer","three-dimensional bodies","junction problem","combined field integral equation","conducting regions","bodies of revolution","Fourier mode number","method of moments","CFIE","integral operators","Mie series","penetrable region","free-space coating","numerical studies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Combined field integral equation formulation for inhomogeneous two- and three-dimensional bodies: the junction problem","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3970887","publicationDate":"May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81498/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined field integral equation formulation for inhomogeneous two- and three-dimensional bodies: the junction problem","sourcePdf":"00081498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046743S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","articleId":"81498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81504,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Accurate vector near-field computations were made rapidly with a spherical wave expansion of the input and scattered fields.

This has been achieved by an electronic shutter, controlled by the electrocardiogram of the subject. The recorded holographic plates processed under identical conditions are scanned by the pointwise method to obtain the absolute displacements at various locations corresponding to the activities of the various cardiac chambers and valves. These data are transformed to a 40*30 matrix by an interpolation method and, from this, three-dimensional displacement plots are reconstructed by an IBM PC/AT computer. These patterns show the displacements over the entire cardiac area corresponding to the activities of various regions during the cardiac cycle. The apex and aortic valve areas show the maximum displacements during the systolic phase. During the diastolic phase the activities over the low-pressure atrial regions are also observed. The results obtained outline the functional details of the normal heart and the activities over various areas are in agreement with those obtained by other noncontact techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2674/00081568.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.81568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.81568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of sequential cardiac in-plane displacement patterns on the chest wall by laser speckle interferometry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Holography","Optical interferometry","Biomedical measurements","Displacement measurement","Heart","Holographic optical components","Adaptive optics","Biomedical optical imaging","Laser beams"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","cardiology","laser applications in medicine","light interferometry","speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG control","sequential cardiac in-plane displacement patterns","chest wall","laser speckle interferometry","electronic shutter","recorded holographic plates","absolute displacements","cardiac chambers","interpolation method","IBM PC/AT computer","systolic phase","diastolic phase","normal heart","noncontact techniques"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electrocardiography","Heart","Holography","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Interferometry","Lasers","Reference Values"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of sequential cardiac in-plane displacement patterns on the chest wall by laser speckle interferometry","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3971097","pubMedId":"1874531","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of sequential cardiac in-plane displacement patterns on the chest wall by laser speckle interferometry","sourcePdf":"00081568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043214S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"48","articleId":"81568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81581,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The emphasize that the Wigner function model is superior to the alternative method based on the transmission probability method even for the static simulation of quantum transport.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.81613","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1246","endPage":"1252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2677/00081613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.81613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of quantum transport in quantum devices with spatially varying effective mass","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Effective mass","Equations","Electrodes","Electrostatics","Diodes","Optical devices","Current-voltage characteristics","Heterojunctions","Tunneling","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant tunnelling devices","semiconductor device models","tunnel diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum transport in quantum devices","quantum-mechanical simulation","Wigner function model","exact nonlocal formulation","Wigner representation","spatially varying effective mass","discretization","numerical calculation","current-voltage characteristics","resonant tunneling diodes","self-consistent calculation","electrostatic potential","precise device simulation","static simulation of quantum transport"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of quantum transport in quantum devices with spatially varying effective mass","volume":"38","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3970901","publicationDate":"June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81613/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of quantum transport in quantum devices with spatially varying effective mass","sourcePdf":"00081613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037296S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"62","articleId":"81613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81623,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A vertical scheme of integration was initially used to realize a photoreceiver circuit on InP consisting of an InGaAs p-i-n diode, an InGaAs/InAlAs pseudomorphic MODFET, and passive circuit elements. The device structures were grown by single-step molecular beam epitaxy with an isolating layer in between. The microwave performance of 1- mu m-gate MODFETs in the circuit is characterized by f/sub T/=9 GHz, although identical discrete devices have f/sub T/=30-35 GHz. The degradation is due to additional parasitic capacitances present in this integration scheme. In spite of this disadvantage the bandwidth of the circuit is 2.1 GHz. Integration of the p-i-n diode with 1.0- and 0.25- mu m-gate MODFETs has also been done in a planar scheme using regrowth, and receiver bandwidths of 6.5 GHz were measured. This value is comparable to that of hybrid circuits with InP-based devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithically integrated InP-based front-end photoreceivers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.81623","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2677/00081623.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.81623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Monolithically integrated InP-based front-end photoreceivers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3970912","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithically integrated InP-based front-end photoreceivers","sourcePdf":"00081623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102752S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"29","articleId":"81623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":81630,"authors":[{"name":"J.-Y.

It allows the qualitative and-with certain restrictions-also quantitative description of all essential features characteristic of critical turn-off of devices based on the gate-turn-off-thyristor (GTO) principle and thus gives insight into the details of the destruction mechanism. In particular, it reflects that the turn-off capability is principally limited by the fundamental phenomenon of avalanche injection. Though idealized and simplified, the model correctly predicts or reproduces results from exact 2-D simulations and experiments-for example, the simultaneous pinning of voltage and current at high levels, the dynamic steepening and bending of the electric field profile, and the occurrence of traveling current filaments.

It is quantitatively verified that the full-wave steady-state solutions can be directly applied to the transient time-domain propagation experiments.

The algorithm's computational complexity is shown to be of order N/sup 2/, a significant improvement over currently used algorithms and fast enough to be embedded in the inner loop of other more general design procedures, e.g., node selection procedures.

Nasilowski claimed that in M=(hS/R)/sup 1/2/, where M is the current coefficient of heating, h is the heat transfer coefficient, including both convection and radiation, S is the surface area of the conductor, and R is the resistance, M is constant for a specific material for a range of currents and for temperature rises up to about 60 K. The author argues that M is approximately constant only for a specific conductor and for restricted ranges of temperature rise and ambient temperature. In his reply, Nasilowski stresses the utility of the assumption that M=constant for calculations of steady state temperature rise of the conductors in a quiet air.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.81823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2683/00081823.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"441","doi":"10.1109/28.81823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contribution to the discussion of '1987 ampacity tables-demystifying the myths'","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Contribution to the discussion of '1987 ampacity tables-demystifying the myths'","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1991","accessionNumber":"3971280","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contribution to the discussion of '1987 ampacity tables-demystifying the myths'","sourcePdf":"00081823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031537S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1991","isNumber":"2683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","articleId":"81823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":81856,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Taking this information into account, a subjective conversational experiment is controlled by six kinds of tasks by varying the temporal characteristics. Thus, a subjective assessment of delay effects is obtained by laboratory tests in relation to the detectability threshold, opinion rating, and conversational efficiency.

The purpose of this research is to realize an intelligent human-machine interface or intelligent communication system with talking head images. A human face is reconstructed on the display of a terminal using a 3-D surface model and texture mapping technique. Facial motion images are synthesized naturally by transformation of the lattice points on 3-D wire frames. Two driving motion methods, a text-to-image conversion scheme and a voice-to-image conversion scheme, are proposed. In the first method, the synthesized head image can appear to speak some given words and phrases naturally. In the second case, some mouth and jaw motions can be synthesized in synchronization with voice signals from a speaker. Facial expressions other than mouth shape and jaw position can be added at any moment, so it is easy to make the facial model appear angry, to smile, to appear sad, etc., by special modification rules. These schemes were implemented on a parallel image computer system. A real-time image synthesizer was able to generate facial motion images on the display at a TV image video rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2689/00081953.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.81953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.81953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A media conversion from speech to facial image for intelligent man-machine interface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image converters","Image generation","Head","Signal synthesis","Mouth","Speech synthesis","Man machine systems","Intelligent systems","Humans","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","parallel processing","real-time systems","speech synthesis","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human face reconstruction","facial motion images","facial expressions","terminal display","speech synthesis","media conversion","facial image","intelligent man-machine interface","real-time image synthesis","intelligent communication system","talking head images","3-D surface model","texture mapping technique","3-D wire frames","driving motion methods","text-to-image conversion","voice-to-image conversion","voice signals","facial model","parallel image computer system","real-time image synthesizer","TV image video rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"A media conversion from speech to facial image for intelligent man-machine interface","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3969780","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A media conversion from speech to facial image for intelligent man-machine interface","sourcePdf":"00081953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068819S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"66","articleId":"81953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":81975,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It consists of two ring resonators with different radii and three directional couplers. The FSR is determined by the least common multiple of the FSRs of the two ring resonators. In order to determine the parameters of the DRR, transmission equations of the DRR, which have different radii, are derived by using the scattering matrix. The dependence of the transmittance characteristics of the DRR on the amplitude coupling coefficients of directional couplers and on the propagation loss of the ring waveguides is studied. The design guidelines for OFDM transmission systems are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2690/00081975.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"736","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.81975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.81975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=81975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide-FSR waveguide double-ring resonator for optical FDM transmission systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical waveguides","Optical resonators","Optical ring resonators","Optical scattering","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","Directional couplers","Differential equations","Scattering parameters","Transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional couplers","frequency division multiplexing","integrated optics","optical communication equipment","optical couplers","optical resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide free spectral range waveguide double ring resonator","optical frequency division multiplexing transmission systems","radii","directional couplers","equations","scattering matrix","transmittance characteristics","amplitude coupling coefficients","propagation loss","design guidelines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/81975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"A wide-FSR waveguide double-ring resonator for optical FDM transmission systems","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3970126","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide-FSR waveguide double-ring resonator for optical FDM transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00081975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034204S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"155","articleId":"81975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":81982,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Finally, it physically implements the prototype design by electronically configuring the reprogrammable hardware. RPM includes embedded tools for interactive debugging with access to any internal design node, and a facility for handling quick incremental changes to the design.

This approach effectively merges the allocation of hardware, the application of transformations, and the handling of hierarchy in a consistent way. Hyper's modular organization around a central database also allows new software modules to be introduced easily. The discussion covers behavioral specification, module selection, exploring the design space, transformations, scheduling and assignment, and hardware mapping. Four versions of an IIR filter generated using Hyper and Lager IV are compared.

It is shown that single filling and emptying can cause 0.1% step noise in channel current. Trap location (3-10 A from interface), time constant ( approximately 10 ms), and energy are found to be quite different from those of prestress (process-induced) traps. The type (acceptor or donor) of the traps can also be identified by RTS measurements; both the process and stress-induced traps with energies near the conduction band edge are found to be of the acceptor type for nMOSFETs and trap levels near the valence band edge are found to be of the donor type for pMOSFETs. Using RTS as a characterization tool, it is found that the stress-induced interface traps are located closer to the interface, resulting in shorter time constants and a stronger influence on the surface mobility than the process-induced traps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/2693/00082058.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/55.82058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.82058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=82058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot-electron-induced traps studied through the random telegraph noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telegraphy","MOSFET circuits","Fluctuations","FETs","Energy measurement","Stress measurement","Hot carriers","Helium","Hot carrier injection","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron device noise","electron traps","hole traps","hot carriers","insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hot electron induced traps","random telegraph signal measurements","trap type detection","n-channel MOSFETs","p-channel MOSFETs","random telegraph noise","individual hot-carrier-induced traps","nMOSFETs","single filling","step noise","channel current","time constant","energy","RTS measurements","stress-induced traps","valence band edge","pMOSFETs","characterization tool","stress-induced interface traps","interface","surface mobility","process-induced traps","3 to 10 A","10 ms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/82058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Hot-electron-induced traps studied through the random telegraph noise","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3971448","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot-electron-induced traps studied through the random telegraph noise","sourcePdf":"00082058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047618S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"42","articleId":"82058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":82059,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

The response times measured for the current devices may be improved by reducing the transverse dimensions of the p-i-n structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.82059","startPage":"276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/2693/00082059.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.82059","endPage":"278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon optical modulators at 1.3- mu m based on free-carrier absorption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/82059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Silicon optical modulators at 1.3- mu m based on free-carrier absorption","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3971449","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon optical modulators at 1.3- mu m based on free-carrier absorption","sourcePdf":"00082059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077315S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"43","articleId":"82059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":82090,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Frequency response of these devices was characterized using a CW-laser heterodyne system at 334.5 nm. For a 4.5- mu m interdigitated device, a 3-dB response of 16 GHz is measured, giving 22 GHz when deconvolved from the package/connector. A detailed theoretical model of the photodiode response incorporating effects of carrier transport and device geometry is in excellent agreement with the measurement.

The emergence of the practical optical amplifier raises the possibility of surmounting this limitation, but only if the accompanying amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), recirculating indefinitely around the ring, can be controlled. It is shown that through proper design, the spontaneous emission can be held to very low ( mu W) levels, thus permitting the construction of amplified 2.5 Gb/s ring networks supporting several hundred nodes spanning several hundred kilometers.

Neural networks actually resemble spreadsheets in several ways. A neural network consists of many simple computational units, highly interconnected and operating in parallel. Each unit has a numerical value (an output), which it communicates to other units along connections of varying strength. Similarly, a spreadsheet contains several thousand cells, arranged in rows and columns, appearing to perform in parallel. The numerical values of certain cells (i.e. their outputs) become parameters for calculating the values of others linked to them via suitable formulas. Just as the units of most networks are identical to each other, the formulas of spreadsheet cells are often highly repetitive, except for the relative location of cells which they reference. The authors do not advocate that all artificial neural networks be implemented on a spreadsheet.

In addition, methodology for mixed-mode-test generation is proposed based on time-domain simulation of faulted analog macros in situ, with surrounding macros being modeled at the device level or the behavioral level.

The transient responses of the defective node voltage and power supply current to the high-impedance state caused by a stuck-open defect were measured to determine if the I/sub DDQ/ measurement technique could detect stuck-open faults. The measured transient response of stuck-open faults shows that this defect acts as a memory fault for normal system and tester clock periods. The data also show that detectable elevated I/sub DDQ/ can occur rapidly for some circuit designs. Elevated I/sub DDQ/ can also occur over many clock cycles as the high-impedance node associated with the stuck-open fault undergoes a drift in its voltage. The I/sub DDQ/ technique is interpreted as significantly enhancing the detection of stuck-open defects, but not guaranteeing their detection.

In this methodology the Monte Carlo fault modeling technique, combined with circuit simulation, was applied to build a defect fault vocabulary. The simulation experiment conducted by using this methodology demonstrated that a spectrum of signatures can be created to represent process disturbances.

The tester architecture is based on the design of an existing internal memory tester, rather than on the design of a conventional logic tester. This design point was an evolutionary outcome of a comprehensive logic test strategy development process. That strategy called for inclusion of boundary scan and array built-in self test in each component design, and for adoption of weighted random pattern logic testing (WRPT). WRPT enables tester data volumes to be reduced by two orders of magnitude in comparison with stored pattern logic testing, while simultaneously maintaining high test quality. The resulting tester architecture and design are described in the context of those decisions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/82339/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3613586","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low cost testing of high density logic components","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost testing of high density logic components","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00082339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060366S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug 1989","isNumber":"2698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"834","citationCount":"26","articleId":"82339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":82350,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In conjunction with the obtained statistical data on the likelihood of each fault and the knowledge of its best observable electrical manifestation, a solid basis for an effective and powerful test pattern generation is provided. To achieve an accurate modeling of bridging faults, a novel fault model, the large-scope short, is developed and implemented. In contrast to other fault analysis procedures which use time-consuming simulation methods to generate or induce physical defects, the proposed Fantestic methodology is very fast in extracting defects and converting them to a ranked fault list. The analysis of some sample CMOS circuits illustrates the effect of different physical defects on circuit-level faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/82350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug 1989","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3613598","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fantestic: towards a powerful fault analysis and test pattern generator for integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fantestic: towards a powerful fault analysis and test pattern generator for integrated circuits","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00082350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033325S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug 1989","isNumber":"2698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"834","citationCount":"19","articleId":"82350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":82361,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The second algorithm, concurrent fault simulation, is found to have a performance that is nonlinear in the number of faults. It also requires either a large amount of memory or a dynamic memory management, both of which are difficult to implement in an accelerator. Yet the concurrent method has the advantage of more efficient event processing and less duplicated effort.

This is accomplished by directly measuring the spontaneous emission at various locations in the laser optical cavity. The authors observe that the highly asymmetric optical field, inherent in DFB lasers, produces a strong longitudinal nonuniformity in the carrier density. This promotes degradation of the lasing gain margin between the dominant TE Bragg modes, which is verified through measurements of the relative shift of the lasing mode in the stopband. The reduction of gain margin is shown to cause multimode operation in devices with large optical field asymmetries. In devices with modest optical field asymmetries, the reduction of the gain margin saturates, and single mode behavior is maintained. Measurements are consistent in many respects with the predicted consequences of spatial hole burning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.83330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2716/00083330.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.83330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"The role of axially nonuniform carrier density in altering the TE-TE gain margin in InGaAsP-InP DFB lasers","volume":"27","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3991480","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83330/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of axially nonuniform carrier density in altering the TE-TE gain margin in InGaAsP-InP DFB lasers","sourcePdf":"00083330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047836S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"32","articleId":"83330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":83334,"authors":[{"name":"I.N.

It is demonstrated that feedback from Rayleigh backscattering can be sufficient to drive the ASE source above lasing threshold in certain configurations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.83334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2716/00083334.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1003","doi":"10.1109/3.83334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output characteristics of diode pumped fiber ASE sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"Output characteristics of diode pumped fiber ASE sources","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"4016791","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output characteristics of diode pumped fiber ASE sources","sourcePdf":"00083334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063112S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"23","articleId":"83334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":83335,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

An XeF excimer laser was used to pump a multimode fused silica UV optical fiber to observe SRS multiple-order Stokes generation. A theoretical model in which SRS is the only nonlinear effect induced was developed to simulate the SRS spectra of excimer laser pumped silica fibers. Good agreement has been achieved on spectral characteristics of SRS between the computer simulation and experimental results, which clarifies several puzzling features observed in experiment.

Because of the small reflections associated with the grating output couplers, and gain saturation by the injected signal, the amplifier self-oscillation threshold is suppressed to current densities above 15 kA/cm/sup 2/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.83392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.83392","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1909","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2718/00083392.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of monolithic integrated master oscillator power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of monolithic integrated master oscillator power amplifiers","publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"27","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4026573","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83392/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of monolithic integrated master oscillator power amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00083392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05064S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"13","articleId":"83392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":83394,"authors":[{"name":"R.-H.

A comparison with various Fabry-Perot structures shows that the ASFP is the best structure in terms of its operating voltage requirement and optical bandwidth.

In particular, a technique for designing a periodically time varying multirate controller that solves SDDP is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.83538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.83538","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2724/00083538.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled disturbance decoupling with stability using multirate control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Sampled disturbance decoupling with stability using multirate control","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4026399","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83538/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled disturbance decoupling with stability using multirate control","sourcePdf":"00083538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031651S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"2","articleId":"83538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":83561,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

Amplitude distributions of compressed RF and video signals were obtained from regions of B-scan images that approximately correspond to the same physical region in a random medium model with known backscatter amplitude characteristics. The amplitude distribution of the signal before compression was obtained by using a table constructed from measurements of the imaging instrument compression characteristics as a function of time gain compensation. While the results indicate the general form of the decompressed data agrees with single-parameter-model curves predicted by a widely used Gaussian random process model, the signal-to-noise ratios of the decompressed envelope vary by up to 20% from the value predicted by that model. This implies that effects such as nonlinearities, envelope smoothing, and noise can cause appreciable departures from theoretical data even under highly controlled conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","RF signals","Instruments","Predictive models","Ultrasonic imaging","Radio frequency","Video compression","Backscatter","Gain measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","backscatter","biomedical ultrasonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear receiver compression effects","medical diagnostic imaging","amplitude distribution","backscattered ultrasonic signals","digitized RF signals","ultrasonic B-scan imaging instrument","video signals","random medium model","single-parameter-model curves","Gaussian random process model","signal-to-noise ratios","decompressed envelope","envelope smoothing"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Automatic Data Processing","Data Collection","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Models, Structural","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Transducers","Ultrasonics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/10.83561","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2725/00083561.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.83561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear receiver compression effects on the amplitude distribution of backscattered ultrasonic signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=83561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear receiver compression effects on the amplitude distribution of backscattered ultrasonic signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83561/","volume":"38","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4004070","pubMedId":"1879854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear receiver compression effects on the amplitude distribution of backscattered ultrasonic signals","sourcePdf":"00083561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032055S","chronDate":"July  1991","isNumber":"2725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"7","articleId":"83561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":83570,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The authors evaluate the performance of the feedback controller by comparing the response of the feedback-controlled system to that of an open-loop stimulation system. In an evaluation based on temporal response characteristics the controlled system exhibited at 41% reduction in root-mean-squared (RMS) error (where error is defined as the deviation from the desired angle), a 52% reduction in steady-state error, and a 22% reduction in hip compliance. The feedback-controlled system also exhibited significant reductions in the variability of these measures on several days.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.83570","startPage":"687","endPage":"698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.83570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2725/00083570.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback control of coronal plane hip angle in paraplegic subjects using functional neuromuscular stimulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83570/","displayDocTitle":"Feedback control of coronal plane hip angle in paraplegic subjects using functional neuromuscular stimulation","volume":"38","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4004076","pubMedId":"1879862","publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback control of coronal plane hip angle in paraplegic subjects using functional neuromuscular stimulation","sourcePdf":"00083570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047052S","chronDate":"July  1991","isNumber":"2725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"82","articleId":"83570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":83583,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Individual RBC deformability is quantified by measuring the cell pore passage time. From one blood sample 200 passage times were analyzed by a computer, displaying mean and median values as deformability indexes, and class and cumulative histograms for studying the passage times distribution. The effectiveness of the system as a routine clinical evaluation tool is demonstrated by studying several factors that are known to affect the RBC deformability.

The following manufacturing processes were used to create this array: thermomigration of 100 aluminum pads through an n-type silicon block, creating trails of highly conductive p/sup +/ silicon isolated from each other by opposing pn junctions; a combination of mechanical and chemical micromachining which creates individual penetrating needles of the p/sup +/ silicon trails; metal deposition to create active electrode areas and electrical contact pads; and array encapsulation with polyimide.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.83588","startPage":"758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2726/00083588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.83588","endPage":"768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A silicon-based, three-dimensional neural interface: manufacturing processes for an intracortical electrode array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1991","displayDocTitle":"A silicon-based, three-dimensional neural interface: manufacturing processes for an intracortical electrode array","volume":"38","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016690","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","pubMedId":"1937509","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A silicon-based, three-dimensional neural interface: manufacturing processes for an intracortical electrode array","sourcePdf":"00083588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071112S","chronDate":"Aug.  1991","isNumber":"2726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"598","articleId":"83588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":83589,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Recruitment curves identified the optimal stimulus configuration as a biphasic rectangular pulse, with an interphase separation of about 500 mu s and a duration of about 50 mu s. The current required for a half-maximal twitch contraction was on the order of 50 mu A.

The adaptive filter essentially minimizes the mean-squared error between a primary input, which is the noisy electrocardiogram (ECG), and a reference input, which is either noise that is correlated in some way with the noise in the primary input or a signal that is correlated only with ECG in the primary input. Different filter structures are presented to eliminate the diverse forms of noise: baseline wander, 60 Hz power line interference, muscle noise, and motion artifact. An adaptive recurrent filter structure is proposed for acquiring the impulse response of the normal QRS complex. The primary input of the filter is the ECG signal to be analyzed, while the reference input is an impulse train coincident with the QRS complexes. This method is applied to several arrhythmia detection problems: detection of P-waves, premature ventricular complexes, and recognition of conduction block, atrial fibrillation, and paced rhythm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.83591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2726/00083591.pdf","startPage":"785","endPage":"794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.83591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of adaptive filtering to ECG analysis: noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=83591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Applications of adaptive filtering to ECG analysis: noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83591/","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016693","pubMedId":"1937512","volume":"38","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of adaptive filtering to ECG analysis: noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection","sourcePdf":"00083591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030622S","chronDate":"Aug.  1991","isNumber":"2726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"533","articleId":"83591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":83601,"authors":[{"name":"H.F.

Low-frequency components were eliminated by building different spectra with optimal high order and fixed low order. The MEM-spectra revealed high frequency components (40-200 Hz) in the terminal phase of the QRS-complex and in the ST-section in 26/38 patients with VT, but only in 2/20 without VT and in 1/20 healthy persons (p<0.05).

Mechanical stimuli were used to selectively activate individual nerve fibers, and the receptive field and receptor type were identified for each unit. Over a period of six months, there was a net shift in the recorded population, but the electrodes contained to provide a representative sample of the activity in the fascicle as a whole. The total number of units from which activity could be recorded remained roughly constant with time, and individual units persisted in the recordings for up to six months.

For passive limb motion (in which no reflex excitation occurred), a second-order linear model did not provide an adequate description of the motion for either spastic or normal legs. System equations including nonlinear mechanical properties simulating asymmetries in the swing and amplitude dependent variations in stiffness and damping provided a more accurate description. For spastic limb motion (in which reflex excitation did occur) accurate simulation required components accounting for abnormal reflex activation, coinciding with the time course of EMG activation. These included increased stiffness and damping with their gains related to reflex EMG magnitude, and changes in the rest length of the stiffness. Comparison of numerical with experimental data showed that the nonlinear model simulated the motion accurately, with the variance accounted for usually exceeding 90%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1991","volume":"38","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4034044","pubMedId":"1743739","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A quantitative analysis of pendular motion of the lower leg in spastic human subjects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantitative analysis of pendular motion of the lower leg in spastic human subjects","sourcePdf":"00083611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148115S","chronDate":"Sept.  1991","isNumber":"2727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"74","articleId":"83611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":83617,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Cartesian product files appear as a result of some secondary key access methods. For the binary case, the problem is reduced to grouping the 2/sup n/ binary strings on n bits in m groups of unsimilar strings. It is proposed that the strings be grouped such that these group forms an error correcting code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the strings of a given group will have large Hamming distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit positions. Intuitively, this should result in good declustering. The authors describe how to build a declustering scheme using an ECC, and prove a theorem that gives a necessary condition for the proposed method to be optimal. Analytical results show that the proposed method is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very close to the theoretical (nontight) bound.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.83636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2729/00083636.pdf","startPage":"907","endPage":"914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.83636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disk allocation methods using error correcting codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Disk allocation methods using error correcting codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4004103","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disk allocation methods using error correcting codes","sourcePdf":"00083636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060688S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"83636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":83639,"authors":[{"name":"F.-S.

The protocol is designed under the requirements that each processor exhibit a random access behavior, that there be no centralized bus control in the system, and that access be granted in real time. The proposed scheme is based on splitting algorithms used in conventional contention-resolution schemes, and utilizes two-state information obtained from collision detection. Two versions of the bus-control scheme are studied. The static one resolves contentions of N requesting processors in an average of O(log/sub W/2/N) iterations, where W is the number of bits in the bit-parallel bus. An adaptive version resolves contentions in an average time that is independent of N.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.83647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1046","endPage":"1053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.83647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2730","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2730/00083647.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiprocessing systems","Access protocols","Communication system control","Processor scheduling","Centralized control","Control systems","Real time systems","Joining processes","Costs","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","multiprocessing systems","multiprocessor interconnection networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contention-based","bus-control schemes","scheduling processors","bit-parallel","shared bus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A contention-based bus-control scheme for multiprocessor systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83647/","volume":"40","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4026481","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contention-based bus-control scheme for multiprocessor systems","sourcePdf":"00083647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045871S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","articleId":"83647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":83648,"authors":[{"name":"C.

An express cube combines the logarithmic diameter of a multistage network with the wire-efficiency and ability to exploit locality of a low-dimensional mesh network. The insertion of express channels reduces the network diameter and thus the distance component of network latency. Wire length is increased, allowing networks to operate with latencies that approach the physical speed-of-light limitation rather than being limited by node delays. Express channels increase wire bisection in a manner that allows the bisection to be controlled independently of the choice of radix, dimension, and channel width. By increasing wire bisection to saturate the available wiring media, throughput can be substantially increased. With an express cube both latency and throughput are wire-limited and within a small factor of the physical limit on performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Express cubes: improving the performance of k-ary n-cube interconnection networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.83652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2730/00083652.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.83652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=83652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Express cubes: improving the performance of k-ary n-cube interconnection networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4026478","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Express cubes: improving the performance of k-ary n-cube interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"00083652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053031S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"129","articleId":"83652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":83660,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The validity of this technique is confirmed by showing the frequency independence of the extracted circuit elements.

A conducting cylinder of unknown shape and conductivity scatters the incident wave in free space and the scattered field is recorded on a circle surrounding the scatterer. By properly processing the scattered data, the shape and conductivity of the scatterer can be reconstructed. The problem is formulated in the form of nonlinear integral equations, which can be solved numerically by the Newton-Kantorovitch algorithm. The pseudoinverse technique is used to overcome the ill-posedness, and the condition number of the matrix is also discussed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the capability of the inversion algorithm using the simulated scattered fields in both near and far zones. Multiple incident directions permit good reconstruction of shape and, to a lesser extent, conductivity in the presence of noise in measured data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.83840","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.83840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2735","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2735/00083840.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic imaging for an imperfectly conducting cylinder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83840/","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic imaging for an imperfectly conducting cylinder","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4034025","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic imaging for an imperfectly conducting cylinder","sourcePdf":"00083840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025242S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","articleId":"83840","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":83848,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The perceptron nonlinearity is based on the error function, which implements the signum function as a special case, and it also includes a bias adjustment. It is demonstrated that the converged adaptive weights of the perceptron are proportional to F, and the proportionality constant is infinite when the bias terms are set to zero.

The authors derive the CDS output power for two-circuit realizations of the double sampling procedure. One realization employs two MOSFET switches while the other replaces one switch with a delay element. Although the methods are not identical in function, they both produce equivalent output power spectra. For arbitrary input power, the output exhibits aliasing in multiples of the frequency with which the switch (switches) of the CDS circuit closes (close). White noise on the input, therefore, may lead to large low-frequency output spectrum values if the system bandwidth is appreciable. The general results are used to derive of both the power spectrum and its integral for the special case of an input signal of first-order low-pass filtered white noise. The authors plot the output power spectrum for two typical cases in which the input may be described as the combination of a (white) Johnson noise and 1/f noise.

The transactions to be aborted are immediately recognized before the validation test, reducing the costs of restarts. Usual read and write locks are used as short-term locks during the validation test. The use of short-term locks in the optimistic approach eliminates the need for the system-wide critical section and results in a distributed and parallel validation test.

Creating an artificial, executable workload, a number of experiments were conducted to determine the effect of different workload descriptions. These workload descriptions characterize the load at one host and determine whether a newly created task is to be executed locally or remotely. Six one-dimensional workload descriptors are examined. Two workload descriptions that are more complex are also considered. It is shown that the best single workload descriptor is the number of tasks in the run queue. The use of the worst workload descriptor, the 1-min load average, resulted in an increase of the mean response time of over 32%, compared to the best descriptor. The two best workload descriptors, the number of tasks in the run queue and the system call rate, are combined to measure a host's load. Experimental results indicate that no performance improvements over the scheduler versions using a one-dimensional workload descriptor can be obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83908/","volume":"17","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4004386","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The influence of different workload descriptions on a heuristic load balancing scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of different workload descriptions on a heuristic load balancing scheme","sourcePdf":"00083908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135272S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"121","articleId":"83908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":83915,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

It is shown that the end-points of a lossy multiconductor line can be represented at each time step by discretized Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuits.

The analysis procedure developed makes exclusive use of infinite line impulse responses in the formulation of the time-domain models. Because infinite lines are matched, there are no reflections in the impulse responses. The result is that these impulse responses are relatively short.

A comparison has been made between the different conjugate gradient and steepest-descent training methods and has demonstrated the superiority of the former over the latter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.83986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/2742/00083986.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.83986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=83986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ship wake-detection procedure using conjugate gradient trained artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83986/","displayDocTitle":"Ship wake-detection procedure using conjugate gradient trained artificial neural networks","volume":"29","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4041352","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ship wake-detection procedure using conjugate gradient trained artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00083986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02377S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"31","articleId":"83986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":83989,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The image process is represented by an autoregressive model with a nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) region of support. New 2-D Kalman filtering equations are derived which taken into account not only the effect of speckles as multiplicative noise but also the effects of the additive receiver thermal noise and the blur. This method assumes local stationarity within a processing window, whereas the image can be assumed to be globally nonstationary. A recursive identification process using the stochastic Newton approach is also proposed which can be used on-line to estimate the filter parameters based upon the information within each new block of the image. Simulation results on several images are provided to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method when used to remove the effects of speckle noise as well as those of the additive noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.83989","startPage":"742","endPage":"753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/2742/00083989.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.83989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional adaptive block Kalman filtering of SAR imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Adaptive filters","Filtering","Additive noise","Speckle","Synthetic aperture radar","Equations","Stochastic resonance","Parameter estimation","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computerised picture processing","filtering and prediction theory","geophysics computing","Kalman filters","random noise","remote sensing by radar","speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D filtering","remote sensing","adaptive block Kalman filtering","SAR imagery","speckle","autoregressive model","nonsymmetric half-plane","multiplicative noise","additive receiver thermal noise","blur","recursive identification process","stochastic Newton approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/83989/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional adaptive block Kalman filtering of SAR imagery","volume":"29","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4041355","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional adaptive block Kalman filtering of SAR imagery","sourcePdf":"00083989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100436S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"32","articleId":"83989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":83997,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For DFB lasers, the spectral broadening caused by laser chirp results in a Gaussian optical spectrum with a width near 5 GHz. Square-law detection of multipath signals from two -30-dB reflections results in an effective intensity noise near -150 dB/Hz. For externally modulated YAG lasers, the same multiple reflections result in interference that cannot be described by an effective RIN. Although the total interference power is comparable to that of the DFB lasers, the signal and interference are highly correlated. As a result of this correlation, multipath interference for YAG-based systems cannot be measured using the standard test procedure with unmodulated carriers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.84165","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2750/00084165.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.84165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2750","startPage":"991","endPage":"995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-reflection-induced impairments in lightwave AM-VSB CATV systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=84165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-reflection-induced impairments in lightwave AM-VSB CATV systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/84165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4016060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-reflection-induced impairments in lightwave AM-VSB CATV systems","sourcePdf":"00084165.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07307S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"45","articleId":"84165","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":84185,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In the model a spatial hole develops perpendicular to the active region involving carriers moving between the wells and the barrier/confinement layers. The modified rate equations describing well-barrier hole burning are presented. An analytical approximation for the nonlinear gain coefficient epsilon , valid only under certain conditions, is given. A numerical solution is given for the case of high photon densities and large capture-times. It is shown how well-barrier hole burning explains the measurements of the increased spontaneous emission from the barrier/confinement region above threshold.

The antenna should have applications in conformal phased arrays at millimeter-wave frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.84572","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00084572.png","startPage":"170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/2767/00084572.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.84572","endPage":"171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 29.3-GHz cavity-enclosed aperture-coupled circular-patch antenna for microwave circuit integration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/84572/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1991","displayDocTitle":"A 29.3-GHz cavity-enclosed aperture-coupled circular-patch antenna for microwave circuit integration","volume":"1","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3974375","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 29.3-GHz cavity-enclosed aperture-coupled circular-patch antenna for microwave circuit integration","sourcePdf":"00084572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05529S","chronDate":"July  1991","isNumber":"2767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"18","articleId":"84572","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":84583,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This problem demonstrates the method's ability to model a rather complex problem where energy not only propagates in a waveguide, but couples to and then propagates within a second waveguide. The coupling consists of a single and a double aperture. The first case establishes modeling requirements and the second case is compared to experiment. Agreement is typically within experimental error, thereby validating the method for this application. Results showed little sensitivity to either mesh dimensions or simulation duration and were achieved using 32 cells for the broad side of the waveguide, 12 cells for the aperture diameter, and 8192 timesteps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.84583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/2768/00084583.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.84583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of waveguide aperture coupling using the finite-difference time-domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=84583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/84583/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of waveguide aperture coupling using the finite-difference time-domain method","volume":"1","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4036841","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of waveguide aperture coupling using the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00084583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036119S","chronDate":"Aug.  1991","isNumber":"2768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"18","articleId":"84583","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":84589,"authors":[{"name":"N.H.

The measurements are obtained by a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor. The joint probabilistic data association merged-measurement coupled filter (JPDAMCF) is used for state estimation which performs filtering in a coupled manner for the targets with common measurements. Two filters are examined: one assuming the displacement noise white and the other one modeling it correctly as autocorrelated. The latter is shown to yield substantially better performance. The proposed algorithm demonstrates the usefulness of the JPDAMCF for tracking crossing targets in combination with the models for the centroid and offset measurements. Even though the centroid offset measurement requires more computations and a more complex model for estimation, it yields significantly better results if the filter accounts for its colored measurement noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.85031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/2783/00085031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.85031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2783","startPage":"582","endPage":"592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of crossing targets with imaging sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of crossing targets with imaging sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4034089","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of crossing targets with imaging sensors","sourcePdf":"00085031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057579S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"16","articleId":"85031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85032,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A representative test case was used to exhibit the usefulness of the algorithm for this problem, and to verify the analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.85033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/2783/00085033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.85033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2783","startPage":"607","endPage":"616","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085033.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear FM signal parameter estimation from discrete-time observations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear FM signal parameter estimation from discrete-time observations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4034091","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear FM signal parameter estimation from discrete-time observations","sourcePdf":"00085033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035469S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"192","articleId":"85033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":85044,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Significant improvements in the absolute accuracy of Loran can be achieved with very simple calibrations. The absolute accuracy of Loran in the Gulf of Maine without calibration is presented. The maximum and RMS absolute errors are between 700 and 500 m, depending on the choice of land model. Simple calibrations greatly improve the absolute accuracy of Loran. As shown, if the land conductivities are fixed a priori and a single parameter is optimized, the maximum and RMS absolute errors fall to around 250 and 60 m, respectively. Alternatively, land can be treated as a single conductivity which can be adjusted to reduce offshore additional secondary phase factor errors. The performance of this practice is summarized in tables which show maximum and RMS errors of around 300 to 100 m, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.85044","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085044.png","startPage":"696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/2783/00085044.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.85044","endPage":"708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using GPS to calibrate Loran-C","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Using GPS to calibrate Loran-C","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4034102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using GPS to calibrate Loran-C","sourcePdf":"00085044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049091S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","articleId":"85044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85058,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Kosko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems and Image Processing Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Kosko","id":"37284621500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"85058","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":96},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85058","abstract":"Structural stability is proved for a large class of unsupervised nonlinear feedback neural networks, adaptive bidirectional associative memory (ABAM) models. The approach extends the ABAM models to the random-process domain as systems of stochastic differential equations and appends scaled Brownian diffusions. It is also proved that this much larger family of models, random ABAM (RABAM) models, is globally stable. Intuitively, RABAM equilibria equal ABAM equilibria that vibrate randomly. The ABAM family includes many unsupervised feedback and feedforward neural models. All RABAM models permit Brownian annealing. The RABAM noise suppression theorem characterizes RABAM system vibration. The mean-squared activation and synaptic velocities decrease exponentially to their lower hounds, the respective temperature-scaled noise variances. The many neuronal and synaptic parameters missing from such neural network models are included, but as net random unmodeled effects.

This is an immediate generalization of the classic Pontryagin principle, to which it reduces in the deterministic case, and is expressed immediately in terms of observables. It is derived on the assumption that the criterion function is the exponential of an additive cost function, and is exact under linear-quadratic Gaussian assumptions, but is otherwise valid as a large deviation approximation. The principle is extended to the case of imperfect state observation after preliminary establishment of a certainty-equivalence principle. The derivation yields as byproduct a large-deviation version of the updating equation for nonlinear filtering. The development is heuristic. It is believed that the mathematical arguments given are the essential ones, and provide a self-contained treatment at this level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.85059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2784/00085059.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"801","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085059.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.85059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"A risk-sensitive maximum principle: the case of imperfect state observation","volume":"36","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3980522","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85059/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A risk-sensitive maximum principle: the case of imperfect state observation","sourcePdf":"00085059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044511S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"92","articleId":"85059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":85060,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lei Guo","id":"37362953200"},{"name":"Han-Fu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Han-Fu Chen","id":"37281177500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"85060","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Stochastic processes","Error correction","Programmable control","Stability","Polynomials","Upper bound","Artificial intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","least squares approximations","self-adjusting systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angstromsstrom-Wittenmark","self-tuning regulator","adaptive trackers","stochastic adaptive control","convergence","stability","optimality","extended-least-squares"]}],"abstract":"Although considerable progress has been made in stochastic adaptive control, the problem concerning the convergence of the original self-tuning regulator proposed by K.J.

Both the state-feedback and output-feedback problems are considered. It is shown that in the state-feedback case one can come arbitrarily close to the optimal (even over full information controllers) mixed H/sub 2//H/sub infinity / performance measure using constant gain state feedback. Moreover, the state-feedback problem can be converted into a convex optimization problem over a bounded subset of (n*n and n*q, where n and q are, respectively, the state and input dimensions) real matrices.

The procedure is repeated until a predetermined number of breakdowns have occurred, and the average and standard deviation of the observed first breakdown levels are recorded. The authors derive the relation between the flashover probability function and the corresponding distribution of first breakdown voltages under the inverse sampling procedure, and show how this relation may be utilized to assess the single-shot flashover probability corresponding to the observed average first breakdown voltage.

A fairly extensive validation exercise was conducted from which a suitable computer model was derived. The input impedance, gain, and radiation patterns of the antenna were computed for special cases where the biconical antenna is used above a conducting ground plane for open-field EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) testing. The effects of height above the ground plane and polarization of the antenna on these parameters were found and the antenna factor was corrected for them. The current distribution along the antenna elements was also examined, and it was found that significant pattern distortion can occur at some frequencies when a horizontal wire biconical antenna is used close to the ground.

Amplitude and phase measurements support the theoretical predictions. It is concluded that, at low frequencies, for the single-op-amp DA the use of a trimming potentiometer is better than relying on low-tolerance resistors, because of the higher CMRR achieved. The DA yields a fixed 90 degrees phase shift for the CMRR at frequencies above 1 kHz. For the three-op-amp 1A, it is important that the input buffers are coupled and that they are built from a matched op amp pair. The best CMRR is obtained when the differential gain is concentrated in the input stage, but in any case it decreases at frequencies above 1 kHz because of the reduced CMRR for the differential stage at these frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.85332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/2791/00085332.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.85332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common mode rejection ratio in differential amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85332/","displayDocTitle":"Common mode rejection ratio in differential amplifiers","volume":"40","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4034048","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common mode rejection ratio in differential amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00085332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027465S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"71","articleId":"85332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":85333,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the second method, the reciprocity theorem is applied to the coupled line. Both the moment method and the reciprocity method make use of the exact Green functions and produce results that are in very close agreement.

No facilities-were available for measuring low-temperature S parameters, but the HEMT noise parameters were measured at a physical temperature of 12 K. The absence of S-parameter information precluded the design of a feedback amplifier, so a balanced configuration was adopted. This has the advantage of providing a good input match even though the amplifiers in the two arms of the balanced circuit are poorly matched. However, there are disadvantages. The loss of the input hybrid degrades the noise temperature and coupling errors in the hybrids, and differences between the amplifiers reduce the gain and result in a noise contribution from the input load. In the amplifier described, these effects degrade the noise temperature by less than 1 K. The amplifier uses commercially available packaged HEMT devices. At a physical temperature of 12 K the amplifier achieves noise temperatures between 3 and 6 K over the 1 to 2 GHz band. The associated gain is approximately 20 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HEMTs","Temperature","Circuit noise","Noise measurement","Scattering parameters","Degradation","Noise reduction","L-band","MODFETs","Feedback amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron device noise","high electron mobility transistors","microwave amplifiers","solid-state microwave circuits","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryogenically cooled amplifiers","UHF","LNA","balanced HEMT amplifier","design details","measurement results","L-band high electron mobility transistor","noise parameters","noise temperature","coupling errors","commercially available packaged HEMT devices","physical temperature","gain","1 GHz","1 to 2 GHz","12 K","20 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.85395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2792/00085395.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.85395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cooled 1-2 GHz balanced HEMT amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A cooled 1-2 GHz balanced HEMT amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85395/","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3991312","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooled 1-2 GHz balanced HEMT amplifier","sourcePdf":"00085395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024851S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"85395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":85396,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This method provides four major new contributions: (1) a transformation of variables is introduced that allows propagation constants to be computed directly; (2) H/sub 1/ (curl) tangential vector finite elements are applied to dielectric waveguides to obtain reliable approximate electromagnetic fields; (3) the Lanczos algorithm is modified to solve the required eigenmatrix equation efficiently; and (4) the reaction principle is used to provide a posteriori error estimates for use in adaptive mesh refinement. The method produces reliable solutions and applies to structures that contain both electric and magnetic inhomogeneities. The answers are refined adaptively to generate waveguide eigenmodes to a specified accuracy. Numerical results of an image guide, a microstrip transmission line, and a pedestal-supported stripline are shown.

Within the IEEE and other standards-making agencies, no comprehensive guidelines exist for the protection of battery circuits from such damage. The batteries considered are of the lead-acid type. Full-load current from a large uninterruptible power supply (UPS) battery may reach thousands of amperes, with fault currents 10-12 times as high. Battery destruction during a major fault can acid-contaminate an entire building, escalating damage far beyond battery cost or equipment downtime alone. Often, no protective devices at all are provided because of a fear of their nuisance operation. Of special concern is the internal fault that may go undetected by devices at a battery's main terminals. The author outlines some user experiences, brings together existing recommendations, and hopes to stimulate development of useful standard practices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1991","volume":"27","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4016974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Battery protection-where do we stand?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery protection-where do we stand?","sourcePdf":"00085479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037565S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1991","isNumber":"2795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"24","articleId":"85479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":85488,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The low-speed torque capability is compared with that of an induction motor, a switched reluctance motor, and a brushless DC PM motor of identical size and copper weight. A particular point of interest is the comparison of motors of different types, all with essentially the same frame size and tested under identical conditions. The results suggest that many of the desirable properties of the switched reluctance motor can be realized with the synchronous reluctance motor but with using standard AC motor and control components.

The IT-CCD sensor has achieved a smear ratio of less than -90 dB, a sensitivity level of 80 nA/Lx, and a maximum charge handling capacity of 1.2*10/sup 5/ electrons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/2796/00085557.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.85557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.85557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1\" format 1.5 M pixel IT-CCD image sensor for an HDTV camera system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image sensors","HDTV","Cameras","Charge-coupled image sensors","TV","Charge coupled devices","Impurities","Lenses","Microoptics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","colour television cameras","high definition television"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interline transfer CCD image sensor","colour TV camera","HDTV camera system","charge coupled device","high-definition television","low smear ratio","impurity profile","buried P/sup +/-layer","on chip microlens array","deep-UV resist","high-fidelity picture","horizontal resolution","sensitivity level","maximum charge handling capacity","1.5 Mpixels","1 inch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 1\" format 1.5 M pixel IT-CCD image sensor for an HDTV camera system","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4052155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1\" format 1.5 M pixel IT-CCD image sensor for an HDTV camera system","sourcePdf":"00085557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058126S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","articleId":"85557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":85558,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The model's six global deformational degrees of freedom capture gross shape features from visual data and provide salient part descriptors for efficient indexing into a database of stored models. The local deformation parameters reconstruct the details of complex shapes that the global abstraction misses. The equations of motion which govern the behavior of deformable superquadrics make them responsive to externally applied forces. The authors fit models to visual data by transforming the data into forces and simulating the equations of motion through time to adjust the translational, rotational, and deformational degrees of freedom of the models.

This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity. The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.85661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2799","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085661.png","startPage":"730","endPage":"742","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2799/00085661.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.85661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery of nonrigid motion and structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion analysis","Optical filters","Shape","Motion estimation","Image motion analysis","Finite element methods","Fourier transforms","Optical materials","Physics","X-ray imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","finite element analysis","Kalman filters","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonrigid motion recovery","3D shape","nonrigid structure recovery","3D velocity","picture processing","finite element method","deformation modes","Kalman filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of nonrigid motion and structure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"13","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4026737","publicationDate":"July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of nonrigid motion and structure","sourcePdf":"00085661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053697S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"258","articleId":"85661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":85668,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The theory is developed for the case when such orientation computations are necessary at all local neighborhoods of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Detection of orientation is shown to correspond to fitting an axis or a plane to the Fourier transform of an n-dimensional structure. The solution of this problem is related to the solution of a well-known matrix eigenvalue problem. The computations can be performed in the spatial domain without actually doing a Fourier transformation. Along with the orientation estimate, a certainty measure, based on the error of the fit, is proposed. Two applications in image analysis are considered: texture segmentation and optical flow. The theory is verified by experiments which confirm accurate orientation estimates and reliable certainty measures in the presence of noise. The comparative results indicate that the theory produces algorithms computing robust texture features as well as optical flow.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.85668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2800/00085668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.85668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2800","startPage":"775","endPage":"790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional orientation estimation with applications to texture analysis and optical flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional orientation estimation with applications to texture analysis and optical flow","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4034319","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional orientation estimation with applications to texture analysis and optical flow","sourcePdf":"00085668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079367S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"380","articleId":"85668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":85669,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M.

The shapes of these clusters are compared with shapes corresponding to a known unimodal distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The best fitting cluster is then removed from the space, and a new iteration starts. Constrained random sampling keeps the computation low.

The problem is to detect and locate the various kinds of defects that might be present in a given fabric sample based on an image of the fabric. Stochastic models are used to model the visual fabric texture. The authors use the Gaussian Markov random field to model the texture image of nondefective fabric. The inspection problem is cast as a statistical hypothesis testing problem on statistics derived from the model. The image of the fabric patch to be inspected is partitioned into nonoverlapping windows of size N*N where each window is classified as defective or nondefective based on a likelihood ratio test of size alpha . The test is recast in terms of the sufficient statistics associated with the model parameters. The sufficient statistics are easily computable for any sample.

The calibration technique enables the recovery of absolute 3-D position coordinates from image coordinates and measured focus blur. A geometric model of the camera's position and orientation in space is used to transform the camera's imaging coordinates into world coordinates. The relationship between the world coordinate system and the screen coordinate system which includes the amount of focus blur, is developed by modeling the camera imaging arrangement. The modeling proceeds first through the perspective view from a pinhole camera located anywhere in space. The camera's lens and aperture system is investigated to find the relationship between depth and focus blur. The aspect ratio of the frame image is considered. Position accuracies comparable to those in stereo based vision systems are possible without the need for solving the difficult point of correspondence problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.85671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2800/00085671.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"813","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085671.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.85671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D position sensing using a passive monocular vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85671/","displayDocTitle":"3-D position sensing using a passive monocular vision system","volume":"13","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4034322","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D position sensing using a passive monocular vision system","sourcePdf":"00085671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038918S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"13","articleId":"85671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85674,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The conventional technique, called synchronous FD, is analyzed. An asynchronous FD method is introduced and its performance compared with that of the conventional method. It is based on the concept of removing descriptors while the simulation procedures access the data structure. This technique guarantees the maximum efficiency in reducing the computational effort. Experimental results show that it can considerably speed up simulation, particularly for large networks. It is shown that a mixed synchronous/asynchronous approach can optimize the total amount of memory needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The fault dropping problem in concurrent event-driven simulation","doi":"10.1109/43.85734","endPage":"971","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2803/00085734.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.85734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85734","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete event simulation","Circuit faults","Circuit simulation","Fault detection","Data structures","Computational modeling","Circuit testing","Central Processing Unit","Electrical fault detection","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","digital simulation","fault location"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fault removal","data structure accessing","fault dropping","concurrent event-driven simulation","test pattern","synchronous FD","asynchronous FD method","large networks","mixed synchronous/asynchronous approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The fault dropping problem in concurrent event-driven simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","volume":"10","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4014780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The fault dropping problem in concurrent event-driven simulation","sourcePdf":"00085734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030391S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","articleId":"85734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85737,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Ching Hsich","affiliation":["Design Autom.

LiB takes a transistor-level circuit schematic in SPICE format and outputs a mask layout in CIF. The layout style is a modification of that proposed by T. Uehara, and W. M. van Cleemput (IEEE Trans. Comput., vol.C-30, no.5, p.305-12, 1981). An optimal transistor chaining algorithm has been developed to derive a transistor placement with a minimum number of diffusion separations. To meet the cell height constraint, large transistors are folded into multiple columns algorithmically. The whole cell is divided into five routing regions. Two are on the diffusion island and the others are rectilinear-shaped routing channels. A graph-theoretic method for selecting nets (subnets) for routing on the diffusion island is proposed. A global routing algorithm has been developed to assign the remaining nets to the three rectilinear channels. For the detailed routing SILK, a simulated evolution router, is employed. LiB can be used as a cell library builder or as a subsystem of a random logic module generator. Users can alternate LiB's layout using a symbolic editor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.85737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2803/00085737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.85737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2803","startPage":"994","endPage":"1005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LiB: a CMOS cell compiler","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LiB: a CMOS cell compiler","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4014783","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LiB: a CMOS cell compiler","sourcePdf":"00085737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07512S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","articleId":"85737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":85741,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

An efficient algorithm for establishing the structure of such models based on data obtained from coupled process and circuit simulators is developed. It selects a minimum number of significant input parameters and automatically establishes an optimum order polynomial regression model. Moreover. the regression models obtained contain information about the structure of the dependence of IC performances on the process disturbances, which can be coded in a dependency tree for each IC performance and used directly for diagnostic purposes.

The effects of SBS on the modulated signals in optical fibers are studied for CPFSK, amplitude shift keying (ASK), and phase shift keying (PSK). A generalized model based on the maximum power spectrum density (PSD) in the modulated signals is proposed for SBS analysis. This model is useful to estimate the Brillouin gain and its threshold to determine the optical power limitation of the fiber for any modulated signal with non-negligible linewidth. It is clarified theoretically that the Brillouin gain with CPFSK approaches that with ASK and PSK at higher bit rates if the modulation index is 1 and 0.65, respectively. The dependency of Brillouin gain on bit rate and linewidth of a laser diode transmitter are evaluated. SBS induced by CPFSK modulated signals was measured to clarify the modulation condition dependences and to verify the model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.85812","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2806/00085812.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1155","doi":"10.1109/50.85812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission limitations of CPFSK coherent lightwave systems due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical fiber","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"Transmission limitations of CPFSK coherent lightwave systems due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical fiber","volume":"9","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4040700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission limitations of CPFSK coherent lightwave systems due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical fiber","sourcePdf":"85812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031472S","chronDate":"Sep 1991","isNumber":"2806","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"37","articleId":"85812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":85815,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A fault in the main LTC compartment later removed one unit from service, but the installation of parallel units at each location allowed for continued operation and control of the power flow on the two lines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085853.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2807/00085853.pdf","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.85853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.85853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiences with parallel EHV phase shifting transformers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transformers","Load flow","Power system interconnection","Power system protection","Integrated circuit interconnections","History","Substation protection","Interconnected systems","Load flow control","Power & Energy Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","load regulation","power system interconnection","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unscheduled power flow control","Shiprock substations","series no-load tap changer","parallel EHV phase shifting transformers","interconnected power systems","Western Area Power Administration","WAPA","New Mexico","Waterflow substations","load tap changer","300 MVA","345 kV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Experiences with parallel EHV phase shifting transformers","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3993482","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiences with parallel EHV phase shifting transformers","sourcePdf":"00085853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0299S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"26","articleId":"85853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85854,"authors":[{"name":"S.

According to the results, reservoirs should operate at the highest possible storage level in order to maximize the generation efficiency of their associated power plants. This conservative behavior is shown to be the most economic for generation purposes. On the other hand, in a cascade system, the water head factor has the effect of specializing the behavior of the reservoirs. Reservoirs in the upper part of the cascade should play a regulation role while in the lower part of the cascade they should operate as run-of-river plants. These results have been verified on an actual large-scale hydroelectric system, the Brazilian South-Southeast Interconnected Electric System, composed of 51 hydro plants and 31 reservoirs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3993483","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal operation of reservoirs for electric generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal operation of reservoirs for electric generation","sourcePdf":"00085854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033951S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"57","articleId":"85854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":85860,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

The solution method is the optimally ordered triangular factorization Y/sub BUS/ method (implicit Z/sub BUS/ Gauss method) which not only takes advantage of the sparsity of system equations but also has very good convergence characteristics on distribution problems. Detailed component models are needed for all system components in the simulation. Utilizing the phase frame representation for all network elements, a program called Generalized Distribution Analysis Systems, with a number of features and capabilities not found in existing packages, has been developed for large-scale distribution system simulations. The system being analyzed can be balanced or unbalanced and can be a radial, network, or mixed-type distribution system. Furthermore, because the individual phase representation is employed for both system and component models, the system can comprise single, double, and three-phase systems simultaneously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.85860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2807/00085860.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085860.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.85860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution system power flow analysis-a rigid approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Performance analysis","Power system modeling","Analytical models","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Computer simulation","Large-scale systems","Power system planning","Power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","load flow","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase","power flow analysis","distribution system operational analysis","optimally ordered","triangular factorization Y/sub BUS/ method","implicit Z/sub BUS/ Gauss method","convergence characteristics","phase frame representation","Generalized Distribution Analysis Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Distribution system power flow analysis-a rigid approach","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4006102","publicationDate":"July 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85860/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution system power flow analysis-a rigid approach","sourcePdf":"00085860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033177S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"336","articleId":"85860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":85861,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The scheme does not require an integer number of samples in an integer number of cycles. It is not limited to stationary signals, but it can track harmonics with time-varying amplitudes. A review is first presented of the common frequency domain techniques for harmonics measurement. The frequency domain techniques are based on the discrete Fourier transform and the fast Fourier transform. Examples of pitfalls in the common techniques are given. The authors then introduce the concepts of the new scheme. This scheme is based on Kalman filtering theory for the optimal estimation of the parameters of time-varying harmonics. The scheme was tested on simulated and actual recorded data sets. It is concluded that the Kalman filtering algorithm is more accurate than the other techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.85861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2807/00085861.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1160","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00085861.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.85861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital recursive measurement scheme for online tracking of power system harmonics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85861/","displayDocTitle":"A digital recursive measurement scheme for online tracking of power system harmonics","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3993488","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital recursive measurement scheme for online tracking of power system harmonics","sourcePdf":"00085861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056099S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"277","articleId":"85861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":85865,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

The ability of coating systems to suppress leakage current, thereby eliminating the cause of wood pole fires and flashover, is discussed. The conditions associated with the temporary loss of coating hydrophobicity and its return are also discussed. Coating life expectancy is considered in terms of the pollution conditions, the frequency of maintenance cleaning, and the formulation of the RTV coating system. It is concluded that RTV coating systems perform by virtue of the fact that they are able to suppress leakage current. This enables insulation systems to attain increased flashover performance of about 30% over uncoated insulations. Under severe conditions of pollution, the effectiveness of the coating systems is temporarily lost, showing only some improvement over uncoated insulation. However, after maintenance cleaning, the coating systems return to their initial state with only a slight loss in their ability to suppress leakage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3993492","displayDocTitle":"Porcelain insulator maintenance with RTV silicone rubber coatings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Porcelain insulator maintenance with RTV silicone rubber coatings","sourcePdf":"00085865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046141S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"35","articleId":"85865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":85872,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

A low minimum 2 ft/s constant wind speed is assumed at all times. Solar radiation is calculated by an analytical solar model assuming clear sky conditions. The IEEE/ANSI ampacity standard is used to calculate T/L ampacity. In the ambient corrected DTR (dynamic thermal rating) system, a stochastic/deterministic model forecasts ambient temperatures. The forecasts and the standard deviations of forecast errors are updated every hour. T/L ratings were evaluated at PG&E locations and gains of up to 34% over the static line ratings were possible at both locations by the proposed DTR system.

The DC system is made up of superconducting cables connected in a meshed configuration. The system could be made up of several large rectifiers feeding hundreds of small inverters connected to points in one or more AC systems. A unique aspect of this superconducting configuration is power transmission, at the optimal generator voltage level. This voltage level is also close to the subtransmission system voltage, eliminating the need for high-voltage insulation and transformers. A reduced system with one rectifier feeding three inverters is studied. The ability to control the output power from the inverters, both locally and globally, is demonstrated. Power control on the circuit with the addition of a superconducting magnetic energy storage coil is also studied. The large inductance of the coil changes the dynamic response of the system and requires a modification of the control system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control applications on a superconducting LVDC mesh","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.85877","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/2807/00085877.pdf","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.85877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=85877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/85877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"Power control applications on a superconducting LVDC mesh","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4006106","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control applications on a superconducting LVDC mesh","sourcePdf":"00085877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047226S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"8","articleId":"85877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":85882,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The circuit parameters of the model are determined based on the measurement of voltages across the insulator strings on an actual 500 kV transmission tower. The multiconductor lightning surge analysis considered enables one to predict the waveform of each insulator voltage, which is useful in determining the phase and the instant of a back flashover. The new tower model is recommended in Japan to be used in the new multiconductor analysis of EHV and UHV class double circuit transmission lines. The new tower model and conventional tower models are compared in the analysis of minimum back flashover lightning currents at a UHV transmission line.

It is shown that by using the state variable transformation technique the steady-state response of the converter can be represented by two state-plane diagrams.

HIMM represents data in a two-dimensional array, called a histogram grid, that is updated through rapid in-motion sampling of on-board range sensors. Rapid in-motion sampling results in a map representation that is well-suited to modeling inaccurate and noisy range-sensor data, such as those produced by ultrasonic sensors, and requires minimal computational overhead. Fast map building allows the robot to use immediately the mapped information in real-time obstacle-avoidance algorithms. The benefits of this integrated approach are quick, accurate mapping and safe navigation of the robot toward a given target. HIMM has been implemented and tested on a mobile robot. Its dual functionality was demonstrated through numerous tests in which maps of unknown obstacle courses were created, while the robot simultaneously performed real-time obstacle avoidance maneuvers at speeds of up to 0.78 m/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.86083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2817/00086083.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.86083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogramic in-motion mapping for mobile robot obstacle avoidance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/86083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Histogramic in-motion mapping for mobile robot obstacle avoidance","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1991","accessionNumber":"4007708","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histogramic in-motion mapping for mobile robot obstacle avoidance","sourcePdf":"00086083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040736S","chronDate":"Aug 1991","isNumber":"2817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"262","articleId":"86083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":86088,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A model for the creation of perfect memory maps for large-scale parallel machines capable of user-controlled partitionable single-instruction-multiple data/single-program-multiple data (SIMD/SPMD) operation is developed. The term perfect implies that no memory fragmentation occurs and ensures that the memory map size is kept to a minimum. A major constraint on solving this problem is based on the single program nature of both the SIMD and SPMD modes of parallelism. It is assumed that all processors within the same submachine used identical addresses to access corresponding data items in each of their local memories. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for being able to create perfect memory maps, and results are applied to several partitionable interconnection networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.86105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/2818/00086105.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.86105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2818","startPage":"290","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eliminating memory for fragmentation within partitionable SIMD/SPMD machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=86105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Eliminating memory for fragmentation within partitionable SIMD/SPMD machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/86105/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4008285","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eliminating memory for fragmentation within partitionable SIMD/SPMD machines","sourcePdf":"00086105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055189S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"7","articleId":"86105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":86106,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

The plane wave spectrum (PWS) approach is used to obtain the test zone field from knowledge of the reflector aperture field distribution. The method is particularly well suited to the analysis of reflectors with a linearly serrated rim for reduced edge diffraction. Computation of the PWS of the reflector aperture field is facilitated by a closed-form expression for the Fourier transform of a polygonal window function. Inverse transformation in the test zone region is accomplished using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm with a properly adjusted sampling rate (which is a function of both the reflector size and the distance from the reflector). The method is validated by comparison with results obtained using surface current and aperture field integration techniques.

A modified two-dimensional (2-D) version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is used to localize the signal sources; range and bearing. A global-optimum maximum likelihood searching approach to localize these sources is discussed. It is shown that in the single source situation, the covariances of both the 2-D MUSIC estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) approach the Cramer-Rao lower bound as the number of snapshots increases to infinity. In the multiple source situation, it is observed that for a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a large number of snapshots, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of both localization techniques are relatively small.

A two-dimensional model has been developed to explain wave propagation through such canopies. The model is intended for media containing vertical cylinders, representing the stalks, and randomly oriented disks, representing the leaves. The formulation treats the canopy as a one-dimensional array of parallel rows, with each row comprising an array of parallel stalks and a random distribution of leaves. The quasi-static approximation used for computing scattering by the leaves is valid only when the dimensions of the leaves are smaller than the wavelength. The model is a field approach accounting for all coherent, multiple interactions occurring in the canopy. The experimental component of this study includes measurements of the attenuation and phase shift patterns for horizontally and vertically polarized waves transmitted through a fully grown canopy of corn plants observed at 1.5 GHz. The model has good agreement with the experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.86923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/2829/00086923.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1023","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00086923.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.86923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Horizontal propagation through periodic vegetation canopies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=86923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/86923/","displayDocTitle":"Horizontal propagation through periodic vegetation canopies","volume":"39","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4016616","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Horizontal propagation through periodic vegetation canopies","sourcePdf":"00086923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060606S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"18","articleId":"86923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":86924,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This antenna, called the microstrip Yagi array, has been developed for the mobile satellite (MSAT) system as a low-profile, low-cost, and mechanically steered medium-gain land-vehicle antenna. With the antenna's active patches (driven elements) and parasitic patches (reflector and director elements) located on the same horizontal plane, the main beam of the array can be tilted, by the effect of mutual coupling, in the elevation direction providing optimal coverage for users in the continental United States. Because the parasitic patches are not connected to any of the lossy RF power distributing circuit the antenna is an efficient radiating system. With the complete monopulse beamforming and power distributing circuits etched on a single thin stripline board underneath the microstrip Yagi array, the overall L-band antenna system has achieved a very low profile for vehicle rooftop mounting, as well as a low manufacturing cost.

The compatibility with the existing TV system and the cost-effectiveness of this application were considered for practical purposes. Equalizer adaptation does not require a knowledge of the transmitted data sequence or carrier phase recovery. Therefore, a reduction in the existing teletext circuitry has been achieved. In addition, the proposed quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme doubles the teletext data transmission rate and uses the allocated TV bandwidth efficiently. The performance of the proposed blind equalizer has been evaluated in the presence of a multipath broadcast channel. Simulations have shown that substantial improvements are observed in the bit-error-rates for both two-phase PSK and QPSK modulation schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Teletext","Quadrature phase shift keying","TV broadcasting","Delay","Phase modulation","Data communication","Bandwidth","Circuit simulation","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","phase shift keying","teletext","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalization","teletext broadcast systems","quadrature phase shift keying","QPSK","TV","multipath broadcast channel","two-phase PSK"]}],"doi":"10.1109/11.86961","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00086961.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/2831/00086961.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.86961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of blind equalization for teletext broadcast systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=86961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Use of blind equalization for teletext broadcast systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/86961/","volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3991218","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of blind equalization for teletext broadcast systems","sourcePdf":"00086961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034668S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"3","articleId":"86961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":86973,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A general formulation is presented for multilevel modulation codes in terms of component codes with appropriate distance measures. A specific method for constructing multilevel block modulation codes with interdependency among component codes is proposed. Given a multilevel block modulation code C with no interdependency among the binary component codes, the proposed method gives a multilevel block modulation code C' that has the same rate as C, a minimum squared Euclidean distance not less than that of C, a trellis diagram with the same number of states as that of C, and a smaller number of nearest neighbor codewords than that of C. Finally, a technique is presented for analyzing the error performance of block modulation codes for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel based on soft-decision maximum likelihood decoding. Error probabilities of some specific codes are evaluated by simulation and upper bounds based on their Euclidean weight distributions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2832/00086990.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.86990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.86990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2832","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=86990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multilevel block modulation codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation coding","AWGN","Block codes","Euclidean distance","Nearest neighbor searches","Error analysis","Performance analysis","Additive white noise","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","coding errors","decoding","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channel","multilevel block modulation codes","component codes","distance measures","error performance","additive white Gaussian noise","soft-decision maximum likelihood decoding","upper bounds","Euclidean weight distributions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/86990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1991","displayDocTitle":"On multilevel block modulation codes","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3991271","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multilevel block modulation codes","sourcePdf":"00086990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037029S","chronDate":"Jul 1991","isNumber":"2832","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"70","articleId":"86990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":86993,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although similar in appearance to the league problem given in an example, it is shown that its two-message complexity is about twice as high as its three-message complexity. The author proves a high lower bound on the chromatic-decomposition number of the playoffs problem's characteristic hypergraph showing that the problem has a high two-message complexity, and that allowing more than two messages may decrease the number of transmitted bits by a factor of two. A technique that improves the lower bound for the chromatic-decomposition number of the playoffs problem is described.

The method is more attractive than others since it is not a mere extension of methods employed in single-phase systems, but comes from the application of a quite powerful and synthetic mathematical tool specifically studied for the representation of three-wire three-phase systems in any possible condition: the Park transformation and the Park vectors. It is proven that the application of this method leads to the definition of two quantities, the real and the imaginary power, that are measurable in a quite simpler way than those proposed by other theories. The two satisfy all properties typical of the electrical power and are directly related, under sinusoidal and balanced conditions, to the active and reactive powers.

The aspects of hardware implementation of the proposed observer-controller are then analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.87057","startPage":"88","endPage":"104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/2834/00087057.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.87057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined observer-controller synthesis for uncertain dynamical systems with applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Variable structure systems","Nonlinear control systems","Uncertain systems","Path planning","Force control","Computer simulation","Hardware","Scheduling algorithm","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","nonlinear control systems","robots","state estimation","variable structure systems","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","state estimation","nonlinear control systems","robots","observer-controller synthesis","dynamical systems","uncertain systems","variable-structure systems","theta -r manipulator","path planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","displayDocTitle":"Combined observer-controller synthesis for uncertain dynamical systems with applications","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3143805","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined observer-controller synthesis for uncertain dynamical systems with applications","sourcePdf":"00087057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034347S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","isNumber":"2834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"174","articleId":"87057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":87060,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this scheme the robot obtains a desired motion by repeating trials (test motion). A merit of this control scheme is that the input torque pattern that generates the desired motion can be formed without estimating the physical parameters of robot dynamics. In practice, to allow the robot motion to approach the desired one in each trial, the input torque given to the robot at the present trial is modified only by the velocity signal of the real robot motion at the previous trial and the desired one. The convergence to the desired motion is theoretically proved for a linear time-varying mechanical system, which is an approximate representation of nonlinear robot dynamics in the vicinity of the desired motion. The effectiveness of this control scheme is demonstrated through actual experiments in which a revolute-type manipulator with three degrees of freedom is used, and the desired motion trajectory is given not only in terms of joint-angle coordinates but also in terms of task-oriented coordinates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1988","accessionNumber":"3143808","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Realization of robot motion based on a learning method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of robot motion based on a learning method","sourcePdf":"00087060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037978S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","isNumber":"2834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"208","articleId":"87060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":87067,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

The result is a novel type of neural network in which the transition bars serve as the neutrons, and the nodes are conditions. Conditions may be conjuncted and disjuncted in a natural way to allow the firing of the neurons. The neuron fires to feed the implication truths into one or more consequent conditions when the MIN of the truth values of the antecedent conditions is greater than the neuron threshold. Disjunctions are also modeled in a natural way. Modifications are made to the usual Petri model to allow fuzzy rule-based reasoning by propositional logic. First, fuzzy values are allowed for rules and truths of conditions that appear in rules. Next, multiple copies, rather than the original, of the fuzzy truth tokens are passed along all arrows that depart a node or transition bar where the truth resides. An algorithm is presented for reasoning using these networks, as well as a simple example for exercising the algorithm. Abduction may be done analogously be reversing all arrows and propagating truth tokens backwards.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.87067","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/2834/00087067.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.87067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Petri nets for rule-based decisionmaking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1988","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Petri nets for rule-based decisionmaking","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3143813","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Petri nets for rule-based decisionmaking","sourcePdf":"00087067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027379S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1988","isNumber":"2834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"329","articleId":"87067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":87068,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Recent considerations of switch architectures have focused on internally nonblocking networks with packet buffering at the switch outputs. These have optimal throughput and delay performance. The author considers a switch architecture consisting of parallel plans of low-speed internally blocking switch networks, in conjunction with input and output buffering. This architecture is desirable from the viewpoint of modularity and hardware cost, especially for large switches. Although this architecture is suboptimal, the throughput shortfall may be overcome by adding extra switch planes. A form of input queuing called bypass queuing can improve the throughput of the switch and thereby reduce the number of switch planes required. An input port controller is described which distributes packets to all switch planes according to the bypass policy, while preserving packet order for virtual circuits. Some simulation results for switch throughput are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.87139","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2837/00087139.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"774","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bypass queue in fast packet switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"The bypass queue in fast packet switching","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3991565","publicationDate":"May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bypass queue in fast packet switching","sourcePdf":"00087139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050334S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","articleId":"87139","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":87140,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The Nash (1950) arbitration scheme from game theory is shown to be a suitable candidate for a fair, optimal operation point in the sense that it satisfies certain axioms of fairness and is pareto optimal. This strategy can be realized by defining the product of individuals user performance objectives as the network optimization criterion. This provides the rationale for considering the product of user powers, as has been suggested in the literature. For delay constrained traffic, the constrained optimization problem of maximizing the product of user throughputs subject to the constraints leads to a Nash arbitration point. It is shown that these points are unique in throughput space, and the authors also obtain some convexity properties for power and delays with respect to throughputs in a Jackson network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.87140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2837/00087140.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness in network optimal flow control: optimality of product forms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87140/","displayDocTitle":"Fairness in network optimal flow control: optimality of product forms","volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"4004307","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness in network optimal flow control: optimality of product forms","sourcePdf":"00087140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038399S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"158","articleId":"87140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87141,"authors":[{"name":"E.F.

The use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) over mobile radio channels was proposed by Cimini (1985). OFDM transmits blocks of bits in parallel and reduces the bit error rate (BER) by averaging the effects of fading over the bits in the block. OFDM/FM is a modulation technique in which the OFDM baseband signal is used to modulate an FM transmitter. OFDM/FM can be implemented simply and inexpensively by retrofitting existing FM communication systems. Expressions are derived for the BER and word error rate (WER) within a block when each subchannel is QAM-modulated. Several numerical methods are developed to evaluate the overall BER and WER. An experimental OFDM/FM system was implemented and tested using unmodified VHF FM radio equipment and a fading channel simulator. The BER and WER results obtained from the hardware measurements agree closely with the numerical results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM for data communication over mobile radio FM channels.

Of special interest is the use of punctured convolutional codes with maximum-likelihood Viterbi algorithm to enable adaptive encoding and decoding without modifying the basic structure of the encoder and the decoder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.87156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2837/00087156.pdf","startPage":"653","endPage":"663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive coding scheme for time-varying channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive coding scheme for time-varying channels","volume":"39","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3991555","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive coding scheme for time-varying channels","sourcePdf":"00087156.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047325S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"152","articleId":"87156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87157,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Maximum throughput is obtained for meteor-burst communications by using a transmission scheme for which the information rate of the code, varies in response to the fluctuations in the power received from a meteor trail. For type-II hybrid ARQ, a variation in the code rate is inherent in the coding scheme. On the first transmission that is made for a data block, a code of relatively high rate is used, but if an additional transmission is required, only redundant symbols are sent, and this reduces the overall rate of the code. The performance measure is the throughput per trail, which is defined as the expected number of successfully received information bits for a given meteor trail. The authors also develop an approximation for the average value of the throughput, averaged over the parameters of the meteor trail. Numerical results for Reed-Solomon codes are included to illustrate the relative performance of the various schemes. It is shown that the throughput is larger for type-II hybrid ARQ than for either fixed-rate type-I hybrid ARQ or ARQ without forward-error-correction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.87160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87160","endPage":"702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2837/00087160.pdf","startPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental-redundancy transmission for meteor-burst communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87160/","displayDocTitle":"Incremental-redundancy transmission for meteor-burst communications","volume":"39","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3991558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental-redundancy transmission for meteor-burst communications","sourcePdf":"00087160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090552S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","articleId":"87160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87161,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

Performance in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is analyzed. Symbol error rate is found to be approximately twice the symbol error rate in a quaternary DPSK system operating at the same E/sub b//N/sub 0/. However, the bandwidth efficiency of differential Q/sup 2/PSK is substantially higher than that of quaternary DPSK. In differential detection, it is quite reasonable to suspect that errors tend to occur in pairs. It is shown that when the error is due to AWGN, the ratio of double error rate to single error rate can be very high, and the ratio may approach zero at high signal-to-noise ratio.

A class of linear detectors is considered as constituting the first stage for the multistage detector. A bit-error probability comparison of the linear and multistage detectors is undertaken.

Both data and carrier are then used to derive the baseband error signal of the code tracking loop. Moreover, a single passband correlator is used to perform the early-late correlation, leading to a hardware complexity equivalent to that of the tau-dither scheme, but without its loss in performance. Results of a thorough theoretical analysis of the system in an additive Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment are reported.

A superior jitter performance for low values of E/sub b//N/sub 0/ with respect to a traditional noncoherent delay lock loop (DLL) is shown, along with the potential gain of Manchester coding upon the more usual NRZ format.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2837/00087166.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.87166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-directed coherent delay-lock tracking loop for DS-spread-spectrum signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Tracking loops","Hardware","Performance loss","AWGN","Jitter","Spread spectrum communication","Degradation","Demodulation","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","delays","spread spectrum communication","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data demodulation pseudonoise code","decision directed tracking loop","coherent delay-lock tracking loop","DS-spread-spectrum signals","code tracking","direct sequence","integrate-and-dump Costas loop","carrier recovery","baseband error signal","passband correlator","early-late correlation","additive Gaussian noise","AWGN","performance curves","steady-state jitter","mean time to first lock loss","jitter performance","DLL","Manchester coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Decision-directed coherent delay-lock tracking loop for DS-spread-spectrum signals","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3991564","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-directed coherent delay-lock tracking loop for DS-spread-spectrum signals","sourcePdf":"00087166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043945S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"87166","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87168,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

The structured channel signaling (SCS) technique decomposes the physical channel into multiple parallel independent signaling subchannels by exploiting the combined eigenstructure of the channel and the correlation of the (NEXT) interference. Computer performance evaluation studies reveal two distinct patterns. For a given loop configuration, as the block length increases, the coding gain usually increases, and for a fixed block code length, the coding gain degrades as the loop length (including bridged taps) increases. For loops at the extreme range of a CSA, block codes of at least 20 symbols are required to achieve a performance commensurate with that of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) composed of an optimal nine-tap minimum mean-square error (MMSE) feedforward filter and an ideal feedback canceler.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block coding capacity of high bit rate digital subscriber lines by the structured channel signaling technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.87176","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2838/00087176.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Block coding capacity of high bit rate digital subscriber lines by the structured channel signaling technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4017002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block coding capacity of high bit rate digital subscriber lines by the structured channel signaling technique","sourcePdf":"00087176.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078411S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"87176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":87178,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The proposed networks are fault-tolerant, self-routing, and intended for a very-high-speed environment. Self-routing networks have one major problem when applied to switching: they are blocking networks. To solve this problem, two methods have been used to create self-routing rearrangeable nonblocking networks: horizontal cascading (HC) and vertical stacking (VS). The authors unify the two approaches and propose a novel class of switching networks. The proposed design principle allows the best tradeoffs among design parameters such as fault tolerance, hardware cost, and the frequency of rearrangement activities. A study of the frequency of rearrangement activities is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2838","startPage":"899","endPage":"904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2838/00087179.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tradeoff of horizontal decomposition versus vertical stacking in rearrangeable nonblocking networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Tradeoff of horizontal decomposition versus vertical stacking in rearrangeable nonblocking networks","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4017005","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tradeoff of horizontal decomposition versus vertical stacking in rearrangeable nonblocking networks","sourcePdf":"00087179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078416S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"90","articleId":"87179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":87184,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As a first step to a quantitative methodology for the design and evaluation of adaptive buffer control algorithms, a detailed statistical characterization of the various encoding modes of an example broadcast quality intra/interframe differential-pulse-code-modulation (DPCM) algorithm is obtained from extensive simulation. The statistics presented include simple measures such as the overall encoded rate distributions for each encoding mode and more detailed intermode and intramode statistics. Two specific adaptive mode control algorithms are proposed. Using simulation over a large sea of representative images, the performance of the proposed statistically based algorithms is compared to that of a conventional buffer-level-based control heuristic which does not require source characterization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistically based buffer control policies for constant rate transmission of compressed digital video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.87184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2838/00087184.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.87184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Statistically based buffer control policies for constant rate transmission of compressed digital video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4017010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistically based buffer control policies for constant rate transmission of compressed digital video","sourcePdf":"00087184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04938S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","articleId":"87184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":87186,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Elimination of the turn-off snubber capacitors allows protective circuit trip levels to be set closer to the device ratings and reduces the energy loss in the turn-on snubber. The size of the turn-on snubber inductor can be significantly reduced. High-frequency operation of GTOs becomes practical with this technique due to the short storage times and low external snubber losses.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/2841/00087262.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed snubberless operation of GTOs using a new gate drive technique","doi":"10.1109/28.87262","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00087262.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.87262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1988","displayDocTitle":"High-speed snubberless operation of GTOs using a new gate drive technique","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1988","accessionNumber":"3152631","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed snubberless operation of GTOs using a new gate drive technique","sourcePdf":"00087262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044241S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1988","isNumber":"2841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"15","articleId":"87262","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":87265,"authors":[{"name":"H.W. van der Broeck","affiliation":["Philips Forschungslaboratorien GmbH, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"H.W.","lastName":"van der Broeck","id":"37274794100"},{"name":"H.-C.

The method exploits a formal specification of the system in which the amount of necessary redundancy can be determined. The system description is based on a combination of a predicate/transition net with regular expressions. The net model provides a formal overview of the system behavior in general, supporting the correct understanding of potential concurrency in the system processes. Regular expressions are used to model the sequential behavior of single-system components in detail. Both model layers provide well-defined levels of error detection; the regular expressions enable the system designer to also determine and introduce redundancy to achieve error correction. The techniques used to describe and analyze system behavior are explained using a case study that contains a stepwise-refined specification and analysis of a multistory shelving system model that has been implemented using the method presented. It is shown that the method applies to any software system which is to be protected against the considered errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.87278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/2842/00087278.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"526","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00087278.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.87278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specification of fault-tolerant system issues by predicate/transition nets and regular expressions-approach and case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87278/","displayDocTitle":"Specification of fault-tolerant system issues by predicate/transition nets and regular expressions-approach and case study","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4004370","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specification of fault-tolerant system issues by predicate/transition nets and regular expressions-approach and case study","sourcePdf":"00087278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063897S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"21","articleId":"87278","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":87317,"authors":[{"name":"J.P. le Jannou","affiliation":["CNET, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"J.P.","lastName":"le Jannou","id":"38160923000"},{"name":"Y.

This is achieved by repeatedly convolving the signal with a very small averaging mask weighted by a measure of the signal continuity at each point. Edge detection can be performed after a few iterations, and features extracted from the smoothed signal are correctly localized (hence, no tracking is needed). This last property allows the derivation of a scale-space representation of a signal using the adaptive smoothing parameter k as the scale dimension. The relation of this process to anisotropic diffusion is shown. A scheme to preserve higher-order discontinuities and results on range images is proposed. Different implementations of adaptive smoothing are presented, first on a serial machine, for which a multigrid algorithm is proposed to speed up the smoothing effect, then on a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallel machine such as the Connection Machine. Various applications of adaptive smoothing such as edge detection, range image feature extraction, corner detection, and stereo matching are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.87339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.87339","endPage":"529","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00087339.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2845/00087339.pdf","startPage":"514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive smoothing: a general tool for early vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87339/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive smoothing: a general tool for early vision","volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3991725","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive smoothing: a general tool for early vision","sourcePdf":"00087339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06054S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"274","articleId":"87339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87343,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.A.M.

A review of watersheds and related motion is first presented, and the major methods to determine watersheds are discussed. The algorithm is based on an immersion process analogy, in which the flooding of the water in the picture is efficiently simulated using of queue of pixel. It is described in detail provided in a pseudo C language. The accuracy of this algorithm is proven to be superior to that of the existing implementations, and it is shown that its adaptation to any kind of digital grid and its generalization to n-dimensional images (and even to graphs) are straightforward.

This includes deciding where to place network processors and links and what capacity nodes and links to use at each location. At a higher level, these decisions also determine the network architecture. The focus is on a two-level network, backbone and local access. Although the selection of specific equipment or the detailed configuration of devices is not discussed, INTREPID is sufficiently fast and flexible to be of use in making such decisions. The principles used in the development of INTREPID and its components are described. A top-level view of INTREPID is followed by a discussion of the design flow, utility modules, and design algorithms.

These systems share the notion that the ability to define and reason with descriptions is basic to the task of knowledge representation. Loom supports a description language (the frame component) and a rule language, and uses its classifier to help bridge the gap between the two. The classifier gives Loom the additional deductive power to provide inference capabilities not found in current knowledge-representation tools. KREME, a knowledge acquisition and editing tool, uses a classifier to help knowledge engineers maintain consistency while developing knowledge bases. One of KREME's functions is to bring both actual and potential conflicts to developers' attention. KREME can also help merge separately developed knowledge bases. Description unification is compared with Prolog-style unification, and the benefits of description technology are examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"4006112","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation","sourcePdf":"00087683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067398S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"22","articleId":"87683","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87686,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The linewidth enhancement factor is measured to be between 4 and 17 which fits with a simple empirical expression.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.87936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2870/00087936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.87936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2870","startPage":"632","endPage":"634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of carrier lifetime and linewidth enhancement factor for 1.5- mu m ridge-waveguide laser amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=87936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of carrier lifetime and linewidth enhancement factor for 1.5- mu m ridge-waveguide laser amplifier","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"4019703","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of carrier lifetime and linewidth enhancement factor for 1.5- mu m ridge-waveguide laser amplifier","sourcePdf":"00087936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069217S","chronDate":"July  1991","isNumber":"2870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"60","articleId":"87936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":87947,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The former constraints are statistic integrity constraints, while the latter are called dynamic integrity constraints. Some situations in which certain dynamic semantic constraints can be automatically extracted are identified. This automatic tool for knowledge acquisition can also be used as an interactive tool for identifying potential static integrity constraints.

The authors propose that in neural-net computing, the processing is the representation. In other words, the very nature of the processing encodes the knowledge. There is no place and no need for a separate body of global rules to be used by the network for inferencing. If rules exist at all, they are in the nature of local processing steps carried out at individual processors in response to stimuli from other neurons. The authors develop this theme together with a theme which is closely related to it. The second notion is that neural networks may also be thought of and implemented in terms of heterogeneous networks, rather than always or only in terms of massive arrays of identical elemental processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.87998","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00087998.png","startPage":"185","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/2873/00087998.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.87998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks and knowledge engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Knowledge engineering","Knowledge representation","Computer networks","Biology computing","Artificial intelligence","Data structures","Concurrent computing","Distributed computing","Books"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","knowledge engineering","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge engineering","artificial neural net computing","distributed processing","localized decision rules","global rules","local processing steps","neurons","heterogeneous networks","identical elemental processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/87998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks and knowledge engineering","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4007975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks and knowledge engineering","sourcePdf":"00087998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040808S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"25","articleId":"87998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":88007,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A method is proposed whereby both contact force exerted by the manipulator, and the position of the end-effector while in contact with the surface are controlled. The controller parameters are derived based on a linearized dynamic model of the manipulator during constrained motion. Hence the method is valid only in a neighborhood about the point of linearization. Additionally, a perfect kinematic model of the contact surface is assumed. The proposed method utilizes the fundamental structure of the dynamic formulation of the manipulator's constrained motion.

The following energic principle for quasistatic systems is discussed: a quasistatic system chooses that motion, from among all motions satisfying the constraints, which minimizes the instantaneous power. This minimum power principle states that a system chooses at every instant the lowest energy, or 'easiest', motion in conformity with the constraints. It is shown that the principle is in general false. For example, if viscous forces act, the motion predicted by the minimum power principle will be incorrect. The authors proved that the principle is correct if there are no forces with velocity-dependent magnitude. This allows its application to many systems with Coulomb friction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88017","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2874/00088017.pdf","startPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of energy in quasi-static manipulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88017/","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of energy in quasi-static manipulation","volume":"5","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3366932","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of energy in quasi-static manipulation","sourcePdf":"00088017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045538S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"2874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"34","articleId":"88017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":88020,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulation results are given for a two-link direct-drive manipulator under adaptive independent joint control. The results illustrate trajectory tracking under coupled dynamics and varying payload. The proposed scheme is implemented on a MicroVAX II computer for motion control of the three major joints of a PUMA 560 arm.

The interfaces between human operator and master, and between environment and slave, are ports through which the teleoperator is designed to exchange energy between the operator and the environment. By computing or measuring the input-output properties of this two-port network, the hybrid two-port model of an actual or simulated teleoperator system can be obtained. It is shown that the hybrid model (as opposed to other two-port forms) leads to an intuitive representation of ideal teleoperator performance and applies to several teleoperator architectures. Thus measured values of the h matrix or values computed from a simulation can be used to compare performance with the ideal. The frequency-dependent h matrix is computed from a detailed SPICE model of an actual system, and the method is applied to a proposed architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00088057.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2876/00088057.pdf","startPage":"426","endPage":"434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.88057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design framework for teleoperators with kinesthetic feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teleoperators","Feedback","Master-slave","Manipulators","Impedance","Computational modeling","Frequency","Computer architecture","Automatic control","Propulsion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","graph theory","matrix algebra","robots","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","graph theory","telecontrol","energy exchange","matrix algebra","force sensing","teleoperators","kinesthetic feedback","hybrid two-port model","velocity sensing","master","slave","input-output properties","frequency-dependent h matrix","SPICE model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"A design framework for teleoperators with kinesthetic feedback","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3468585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design framework for teleoperators with kinesthetic feedback","sourcePdf":"00088057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029117S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"2876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"716","articleId":"88057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":88062,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A set of kinematic functions is defined in Cartesian or joint space to reflect the desirable configuration. The user-defined kinematic functions and the end-effector Cartesian coordinates are combined to form a set of task-related configuration variables as generalized coordinates for the manipulator. A task-based adaptive scheme is then utilized to control directly the configuration variables so as to achieve tracking of some desired reference trajectories throughout the robot motion. This accomplishes the basic task of desired end-effector motion, while utilizing the redundancy to achieve any additional task through the desired time variation of the kinematic functions. Simulation results for a direct-drive two-link arm are given to illustrate the proposed control scheme. The scheme has also been implemented for real-time control of three links of a PUMA 560 industrial robot, and experimental results are presented and discussed. The simulation and experimental results validate the configuration control scheme, and demonstrate its capabilities for performing various realistic tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2876/00088062.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2876","startPage":"472","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configuration control of redundant manipulators: theory and implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Configuration control of redundant manipulators: theory and implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3468590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configuration control of redundant manipulators: theory and implementation","sourcePdf":"00088062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04614S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"2876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"328","articleId":"88062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":88065,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The multiarm forward dynamics solutions provide a thorough physical and mathematical understanding of the way several arms behave in response to a set of applied joint moments. The forward dynamics algorithms also provide the necessary analytical foundation for conducting analysis and simulation studies. The multiarm algorithms are based on the filtering and smoothing approach advanced by the author for single-arm dynamics (IEEE Trans. Robots Autom., Dec. 1987, no.6, Dec. 1987 pp.624-39), and they can be built up modularly from the single-arm algorithms. The algorithms compute recursively the joint angle-accelerations, the contact forces, and the task-object accelerations. Algorithms are also developed to evaluate in closed form the linear transformations from the active joint moments to the joint angle accelerations, to the task object accelerations, and to the task-object contact forces. A possible computing architecture is presented as a precursor to a more complete investigation of the computational performance of the dynamics algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88065","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"510","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2876/00088065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive forward dynamics for multiple robot arms moving a common task object","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Manipulators","Heuristic algorithms","Acceleration","Algorithm design and analysis","Arm","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Filtering algorithms","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamics","filtering and prediction theory","mechanical engineering computing","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical engineering computing","recursive forward dynamics","multiple robot arms","common task object","filtering","smoothing","joint angle-accelerations","contact forces","task-object accelerations","computing architecture","computational performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Recursive forward dynamics for multiple robot arms moving a common task object","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3468593","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88065/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive forward dynamics for multiple robot arms moving a common task object","sourcePdf":"00088065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036493S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"2876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"32","articleId":"88065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":88066,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Therefore, multiple sensors can be hierarchically integrated into an existing system. To make the integration feasible, the author adopts the concept of logical sensors and treats logical sensors as object modules. By using object-oriented programming, integration becomes a modular procedure and interobject communication becomes an effective method of data flow required by the integration. The authors also proposes an objective method for evaluating the performance of integration. The benefit of the integration is measured by how the intelligence of the robotic system is enhanced. The cost of the integration is measured by a cost function and a loss function.

It is known that path planning algorithms with proven convergence can be designed for some planar and three-dimensional robot arm manipulators operating among unknown obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The attractiveness of such systems lies in their ability to operate in a complex, perhaps even time-varying, unstructured environment. Implementation of these algorithms, however, presents a variety of hardware and algorithmic problems related to: covering the arm with arrays of sensors to form a sensitive skin; processing real-time sensor data; designing complementary algorithms for step-by-step motion planning based on limited local information; and integrating these components, together with global planning algorithms, in a single system. The authors discuss various tradeoffs and solutions implemented in the sensor-based planning system for a planar arm manipulator developed in their laboratory and present a summary of their experiments with it.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88096","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"740","endPage":"751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2878/00088096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proximity sensing in robot manipulator motion planning: system and implementation issues","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Manipulators","Motion planning","Sensor arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Sensor systems","Process planning","Path planning","Convergence","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control","robots","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile sensors","position control","time varying environment","robot manipulator","motion planning","uncertain environment","unstructured environment","sensitive skin","local information","global planning algorithms","sensor-based planning system","planar arm manipulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Proximity sensing in robot manipulator motion planning: system and implementation issues","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3621623","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88096/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proximity sensing in robot manipulator motion planning: system and implementation issues","sourcePdf":"00088096.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029625S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"2878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"73","articleId":"88096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":88097,"authors":[{"name":"B.G.

Simultaneously, the network was used during each control cycle to predict the actuator drives required to follow a desired trajectory, and these drives were used as feedforward terms in parallel to a fixed-gain linear feedback controller. Trajectory tracking errors were found to converge to low values within a few training trials, and to be relatively insensitive to the choice of control system gains.

The models used for each of the links contain only four parameters to identify. The experimental procedures used to identify the parameters of the various models proposed are discussed. An iterative technique to solve the inverse kinematic solution is presented. The procedures developed have been applied to an industrial robot. Finally, the relative effects of each of the models used to calibrate the robot are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88114","startPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2879/00088114.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88114","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A technique to calibrate industrial robots with experimental verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"A technique to calibrate industrial robots with experimental verification","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3621632","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique to calibrate industrial robots with experimental verification","sourcePdf":"00088114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046144S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"2879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"135","articleId":"88114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":88117,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

The basic algorithm is a simple extension of the polytope distance algorithm described by E.G. Gilbert et al. (1988). It utilizes the support mappings of the sets representing the objects. A calculus for evaluating these mappings that allows the extended algorithm to be applied to a rich family of nonpolytopal objects is presented.

In particular, the following two problems are addressed: (1) given the geometry of the rigid bodies, determine the existence of an admissible path between two contact configurations; and (2) assuming that an admissible path exists, find such a path. First, the configuration space of contact is defined, and the differential equations governing the rolling constraint are derived. Then, a generalized version of Frobenius's theorem, known as Chow's theorem, for determining the existence of motion is applied. Finally, an algorithm is proposed that generates a desired path with one of the objects being flat.

A key concept in the proposed formulations is the use of pseudoinverses to provide a decomposition of the original problem in a form that is more amenable to optimization. The new formulations can be described as being either interior- or exterior-based methods. Geometrically, interior methods start a search in force space with a force that is inside the friction cone constraints but does not necessarily meet the required body forces and torques. Exterior methods start with forces that meet the required body forces and torques but may be outside the friction cone constraints. It is shown that exterior methods have the potential for providing better force command continuity when the solution from the previous control cycle is considered or, alternatively, these methods can be used to minimize the maximum friction cone angle over all the legs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal force distribution for the legs of a walking machine with friction cone constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.88119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2879/00088119.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Optimal force distribution for the legs of a walking machine with friction cone constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3621636","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal force distribution for the legs of a walking machine with friction cone constraints","sourcePdf":"00088119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04989S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"2879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"136","articleId":"88119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":88120,"authors":[{"name":"Y.F.

By means of sensing devices, namely position sensors on the joints and force sensors underneath the heel and toe, the robot is able to detect the transition of the supporting terrain from a flat floor to a sloping surface. An algorithm is developed for the biped robot control system to evaluate the inclination of the supporting foot and the unknown gradient, and a compliant motion scheme is then used to enable the robot to transfer from level walking to climbing the slope. While the robot walks on the slope, the gait synthesis is a simple modification to the one used for level walking. Experiments with the SD-2 biped robot show that the overall scheme, while simple to implement, is powerful and reliable enough to permit walking from level to slope or vice versa. Finally, it is argued that the proposed mechanism can be extended to quasi-dynamic and dynamic gaits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2879/00088120.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.88120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gait synthesis for the SD-2 biped robot to climb sloping surface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Robot sensing systems","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Force sensors","Robot control","Foot","Control system synthesis","Laboratories","Robotics and automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force measurement","mobile robots","position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","position measurement","force measurement","quasi-dynamic gaits","SD-2 biped robot","sloping surface","sensing devices","position sensors","joints","force sensors","heel","toe","inclination","compliant motion scheme","climbing","gait synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Gait synthesis for the SD-2 biped robot to climb sloping surface","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3621637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gait synthesis for the SD-2 biped robot to climb sloping surface","sourcePdf":"00088120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039037S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"2879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"145","articleId":"88120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":88136,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The basic approach is to restrict the free space concerning path planning and to avoid executing unnecessary collision detections. The six-dimensional configuration space is equally quantized into cells by placing a regular grid, and the cells concerning path planning are enumerated by simultaneously executing multiple search strategies. Search strategies of different characteristics are defined by assigning different values to the coefficients of heuristic functions. The efficiency of each search strategy is evaluated during free-space enumeration, and a more promising one is automatically selected and preferentially executed. The free-space cells are efficiently enumerated for an arbitrary moving object in all kinds of working environments. The implementation of this method on several examples that have different characteristics is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.88136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2880/00088136.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2880","startPage":"267","endPage":"277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning with six degrees of freedom by multistrategic bidirectional heuristic free-space enumeration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion planning with six degrees of freedom by multistrategic bidirectional heuristic free-space enumeration","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3983061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion planning with six degrees of freedom by multistrategic bidirectional heuristic free-space enumeration","sourcePdf":"00088136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061098S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"90","articleId":"88136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":88137,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Three methods for controlling step length, each of which adjusts a different parameter of the running cycle, are discussed.

All three control methods are successful in manipulating step length in laboratory experiments, but the method that adjusted forward speed provided the widest range of step lengths with accurate control of step length. The three methods for controlling step length manipulated the dynamics of the system so the feet could be placed on the available footholds without disturbing the system's balance.

An algorithm for, model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is developed. The algorithm is based on an extended Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. Two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a 'Robuter' mobile robot and six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2880/00088147.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.88147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile robot localization by tracking geometric beacons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Sonar navigation","Vehicles","Motion planning","Maintenance","Robustness","Solid modeling","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Sonar measurements","Kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","mobile robots","navigation","sonar","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric beacon tracking","Kaman filter","mobile robot","navigation","model-based localization","point kinematics","Robuter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot localization by tracking geometric beacons","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3983072","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot localization by tracking geometric beacons","sourcePdf":"00088147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058784S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"810","articleId":"88147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":88148,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The control method used is impedance control in which the controlled variables are the dynamic relations between the motion variables of the robot manipulator's tip and the forces exerted by the tip. The main task used is that of wiping a surface whose geometry is not precisely known. The learning scheme does not use a model of the robot and its environment. It is a stochastic scheme that uses a single scalar value as a measure of the system performance. The scheme is found to perform quite well. A few variants of the main scheme are discussed.

Characteristics that distinguish the visual computation and motion control requirements in dynamic environments from that in static environments are discussed. Objectives of the vision and motion planning are formulated, such as finding a collision-free trajectory that takes account of any possible motions of obstacles in the local environments. Such a trajectory should be consistent with a global goal or plan of the motion and the robot should move at as high a speed as possible, subject to its kinematic constraints. A stochastic motion-control algorithm based on a hidden Markov model is developed. Obstacle motion prediction applies a probabilistic evaluation scheme. Motion planning of the robot implements a trajectory-guided parallel-search strategy in accordance with the obstacle motion prediction models. The approach simplifies the control process of robot motion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov model for dynamic obstacle avoidance of mobile robot navigation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/70.88149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/2880/00088149.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.88149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov model for dynamic obstacle avoidance of mobile robot navigation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3983074","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov model for dynamic obstacle avoidance of mobile robot navigation","sourcePdf":"00088149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03172S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"114","articleId":"88149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":88160,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In contrast to other hybrid techniques involving the finite-element method, the method is in principle exact, and can be implemented using low O(N) amounts of storage. This is of particular importance for large-scale applications, and is a characteristic of the boundary chosen to terminate the finite-element mesh, usually as close to the structure as possible. A general description of the method, without reference to any specific geometry or application, is given. A number of 2-D and 3-D applications are then considered, to demonstrate its accuracy, efficiency, and capabilities. Of particular concern in these applications is the choice of the fictitious boundary enclosing the structure. Boundaries of a certain class lead to convolutional boundary integrals, which can be evaluated by the fast Fourier transform without generating a matrix, thus retaining the O(N) storage requirement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/74.88218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","startPage":"22","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/2883/00088218.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00088218.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.88218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite-element-boundary-integral method for scattering and radiation by two- and three-dimensional structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Fast Fourier transforms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Laboratories","Large-scale systems","Electromagnetic radiation","Impedance","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-elements methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two dimensional structures","2D structures","3D structures","EM scattering","EM radiation","finite-element-boundary-integral method","three-dimensional structures","composite structures","hybrid techniques","accuracy","convolutional boundary integrals","fast Fourier transform","storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"A finite-element-boundary-integral method for scattering and radiation by two- and three-dimensional structures","volume":"33","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4036688","publicationDate":"June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88218/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite-element-boundary-integral method for scattering and radiation by two- and three-dimensional structures","sourcePdf":"00088218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042883S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"77","articleId":"88218","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":88220,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

The force vector was produced by electrical stimulation of muscles. Two coupling issues must be dealt with by the control system. First, there is a geometric coupling between the end-point force vector and joint torques on which amplitude and orientation of the force vector depend. Second, torques at two joints may be coupled due to activation of muscles that cross them (biarticular coupling). To eliminate the geometric coupling, a transformation of controller error from the Cartesian space to the joint space was employed. A multivariable proportional-plus-integral (PI) control law was used to calculate muscle activation based on the transformed controller error. Centralized and decentralized controls were investigated for decoupling the effects of biarticular muscles. Test results show that the magnitude and orientation of end-point forces could be regulated by this controller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88441/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4069674","pubMedId":"1761296","volume":"38","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control of end-point forces of a multijoint limb by functional neuromuscular stimulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of end-point forces of a multijoint limb by functional neuromuscular stimulation","sourcePdf":"00088441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055354S","chronDate":"Oct.  1991","isNumber":"2887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"36","articleId":"88441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":88443,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The ATW integrates active controls with a flexible wing structure to provide optimal wing shapes to meet particular flight performance criteria. The use of a fuzzy controller for roll rate and load alleviation control was investigated. Fuzzy rules were developed to determine the appropriate control surface deflections to achieve the desired roll rate while ensuring that wing loads are within safe bounds. The modulation of the damping factor is according to the distance of the system state from the goal state. This damping modulation technique allows full utilization of the vehicle's acceleration capability and resulted in an improvement of the response time by a factor of two. The resultant fuzzy controller commands six surface deflections to control the roll rate and four torsion moments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00088591.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/2893/00088591.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/37.88591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.88591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=88591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy logic for control of roll and moment for a flexible wing aircraft","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Aircraft","Aerospace control","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Shape control","Testing","Aerodynamics","Damping","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","damping","fuzzy logic","multivariable control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","roll control","MIMO systems","aircraft control","flexible wing aircraft","Advanced Technology Wing","fuzzy controller","surface deflections","roll rate","damping factor","torsion moments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy logic for control of roll and moment for a flexible wing aircraft","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3978489","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy logic for control of roll and moment for a flexible wing aircraft","sourcePdf":"00088591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0318S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"90","articleId":"88591","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":88596,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

The method discussed is based on structured singular-value analysis and H-infinity optimization and is known as mu synthesis. Three different control designs are discussed: a mixed-sensitivity design, three-block mu synthesis design, and an alternate design for comparison. The mixed-sensitivity design inverts the rocket's first elastic mode poles and zeros. This is undesirable because these poles and zeros are near the j omega axis and hence can be destabilized for small model perturbations. The three-block mu synthesis design attacks this problem directly with blocks for mixed sensitivity, pole perturbation, and zero perturbation. The mu synthesis approach is successful in finding a compensator that is more robust to these perturbations while simultaneously satisfying the mixed-sensitivity objective. The alternate design also does not invert the first elastic mode pole and zero. However, it does not provide sufficient rolloff to attenuate or gain stabilize the second and higher frequency modes, as does the mu synthesis design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.88596","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00088596.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/2893/00088596.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"73","doi":"10.1109/37.88596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rocket stabilization as a structured singular value synthesis design example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Rocket stabilization as a structured singular value synthesis design example","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3978493","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/88596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rocket stabilization as a structured singular value synthesis design example","sourcePdf":"00088596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023369S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"17","articleId":"88596","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":88621,"authors":[{"name":"G.S.

Recently, it has shown that the poor bandwidth of this type of antenna can be increased by coupling the resonant patch to the slot near its resonance. In this case, although the bandwidth is increased drastically, this technique induces a quite high back radiation level, due to the proximity of the resonance of the slot that radiates on both sides of the ground plane. To alleviate this problem, stacked patches were used to achieve the bandwidth. In this case, the resonance of the slot is chosen to be as far as possible from the operating band of the antenna so that its radiation level will be small. The comparison of the calculated and measured impedance loci of C band antenna shows good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1991","publicationDate":"Oct. 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4036865","volume":"1","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stacked slot-coupled printed antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stacked slot-coupled printed antenna","sourcePdf":"00089098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02658S","chronDate":"Oct.  1991","isNumber":"2908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"61","articleId":"89098","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":89256,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Besides dealing with the periodicity constraints (which have been the sole concern of many previous algorithms), this algorithm handles precedence, communication, and fault-tolerance requirements of subtasks of the tasks. The algorithm determines the allocation of subtasks of periodic tasks to sites, the scheduled start times of subtasks allocated to a site, and the schedule for communication along the communication channel(s). Experimental evaluation of the algorithm shows that the heuristics and search techniques incorporated in the algorithm are extremely effective. Specifically, they show that, if a task set can be feasibly allocated and scheduled, the algorithm is highly likely to find it without any backtracking during the search.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.1990.89256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2912","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","pdfPath":"/iel2/290/2912/00089256.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.,10th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.,10th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.1990.89256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation and scheduling of complex periodic tasks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Real time systems","Fault tolerance","Information science","Timing","Time factors","TV","Orbital robotics","Robotics and automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","fault tolerant computing","real-time systems","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication requirements","time critical systems","complex periodic task scheduling","task allocation","distributed systems","periodicity constraints","precedence","fault-tolerance","scheduled start times"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 May-1 Jun 1990","displayDocTitle":"Allocation and scheduling of complex periodic tasks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89256/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3908291","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"28 May-1 June 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation and scheduling of complex periodic tasks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00089256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039709S","chronDate":"28 May-1 Jun 1990","isNumber":"2912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"290","citationCount":"106","articleId":"89256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":89272,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In addition to evaluating basic system dependability characteristics, such as error and failure distributions and hazard rates for both individual machines and the VAXcluster, they develop reward models to analyze the impact of failures on the system as a whole. The results show that more than 46% of all failures were due to errors in shared resources. This is despite the fact that these errors have a recovery probability greater than 0.99. The hazard rate calculations show that not only errors but also failures occur in bursts. Approximately 40% of all failures occur in bursts and involve multiple machines. This result indicates that correlated failures are significant. Analysis of rewards shows that software errors have the lowest reward (0.05 versus 0.74 for disk errors). The expected reward rate (reliability measure) of the VAXcluster drops to 0.5 in 18 hours for the 7-out-of-7 model and in 80 days for the 3-out-of-7 model. The VAXcluster system availability is evaluated to be 0.993 250 days of operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure analysis and modeling of a VAXcluster system","publicationTitle":"[1990] Digest of Papers.

In the initial phase, a program is run to solve a problem and store the results. In addition, this program leaves behind a trail of data, called a certification trail. In the second phase, another program is run, and it solves the original problem again. This program, however, has access to the certification trail left by the first program. Because of the availability of the certification trail, the second phase can be performed by a less complex program and can execute more quickly. In the final phase, the two results are compared, and if they agree, the results are accepted as correct; otherwise, an error is indicated.

The processors are placed in a square grid and are interconnected to one another through horizontal and vertical optical buses. This architecture has an effective diameter as small as two owing to its orthogonal bus connections, and it allows all processors to have simultaneous access to the buses owing to its capability for pipelining messages. Although the resulting architecture is meshlike and uses bus connections, it has a substantially higher bandwidth than conventional and bus-augmented mesh computers. Moreover, it has a simple control structure and is universal in that various well-known multiprocessor interconnections can be efficiently embedded in it. This architecture appears to be a good candidate for hybrid optical-electronic systems in the next generation of parallel computers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FMPC.1990.89479","publicationTitle":"[1990 Proceedings] The Third Symposium on the Frontiers of Massively Parallel Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1990 Proceedings] The Third Symposium on the Frontiers of Massively Parallel Computation","pdfPath":"/iel2/294/2914/00089479.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FMPC.1990.89479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array processors with pipelined optical busses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Array processors with pipelined optical busses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3908243","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array processors with pipelined optical busses","confLoc":"College Park, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00089479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054681S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct 1990","isNumber":"2914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"294","citationCount":"25","articleId":"89479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":89482,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The previously known transformation does not preserve the security (i.e. the running time of the inverting algorithm) within any polynomial. Its resulting function, F(x), applies the weak one-way function to many small (of length mod x mod /sup theta /, theta <1) pieces of the input. Consequently, the function can be inverted for reasonable input lengths by exhaustive search. Random walks on constructive expanders are used to transform any regular (e.g. one-to-one) weak one-way function into a strong one, while preserving security. The resulting function, F(x), applies the weak one-way f to strings of length Theta ( mod x mod ). The security-preserving constructions yield efficient pseudorandom generators and signatures based on any regular one-way function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSCS.1990.89550","publicationTitle":"Proceedings [1990] 31st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings [1990] 31st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/310/2915/00089550.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"326 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/FSCS.1990.89550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security preserving amplification of hardness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct 1990","displayDocTitle":"Security preserving amplification of hardness","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 1990","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3908514","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89550/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security preserving amplification of hardness","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00089550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038442S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct 1990","isNumber":"2915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"310","citationCount":"45","articleId":"89550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":89559,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For the yield calculations, the threshold gain difference and the longitudinal spatial hole burning (SHB) are taken into account. By comparing the experimental and theoretical yield of index-coupled DFB lasers, the significance of SHB for correct yield predictions is illustrated. For the purpose of comparison, yield calculations for various lambda /4-shifted DFB lasers (with low facet reflectivities) are presented. The most emphasis, however, is on partly gain-coupled DFB lasers. Estimations of practical gain coupling coefficient values for gain and for loss gratings are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser modes","Laser theory","Laser feedback","Reflectivity","Gratings","Performance gain","Design optimization","Optical fiber communication","Laser stability","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed feedback lasers","laser modes","optical hole burning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["index coupled distributed feedback laser structures","phase shifted DFB lasers","spatial hole burning corrected yield","statistical yield analysis","threshold gain difference","longitudinal spatial hole burning","partly gain-coupled DFB lasers","practical gain coupling coefficient","loss gratings"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.89938","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00089938.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2982/00089938.pdf","startPage":"1714","endPage":"1723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.89938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain-coupled DFB lasers versus index-coupled and phase shifted DFB lasers: a comparison based on spatial hole burning corrected yield","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=89938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gain-coupled DFB lasers versus index-coupled and phase shifted DFB lasers: a comparison based on spatial hole burning corrected yield","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89938/","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain-coupled DFB lasers versus index-coupled and phase shifted DFB lasers: a comparison based on spatial hole burning corrected yield","sourcePdf":"00089938.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046515S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"124","articleId":"89938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":89939,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The method yields a high conversion efficiency and a converted signal output power up to 10 dBm is obtainable. It is shown that the input signal power can vary by three orders of magnitude with nearly no degradation of the conversion efficiency. By means of the input powers, the conversion efficiency can be maximized. The dependence of the conversion efficiency is analyzed for fixed input powers.

The theoretical calculation for n/sub 2/ shows excellent agreement with measured values for a five-order-of-magnitude variation in the modulus of n/sub 2/ in semiconductors and wide-gap optical solids. Beam distortion methods were used to measure n/sub 2/ in semiconductors.

The theoretical predictions are compared to results from actual device measurements. A novel technique is introduced to determine material parameters: fabrication of in-plane lasers from VCSEL material. The procedure used to determine the optical mode in such an in-plane laser is described.

The authors obtained 140 unique, uniformly separated, single-mode wavelength emissions from a 7*20 VCSEL array. Large total wavelength span ( approximately 430 AA) and small wavelength separation ( approximately 3 AA) are obtained simultaneously with uncompromised laser performance. All 140 lasers have nearly the same threshold currents, voltages, and resistances. Wavelength tuning is obtained by using a three-mirror coupled-cavity configuration. The three-mirror laser is a two-terminal device and requires only one top contact. Discrete tuning with a range as large as 61 AA is achieved with a small change in drive current of only 10.5 mA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.89953","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00089953.png","startPage":"1368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2982/00089953.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.89953","endPage":"1376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple wavelength tunable surface-emitting laser arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multiple wavelength tunable surface-emitting laser arrays","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4026541","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple wavelength tunable surface-emitting laser arrays","sourcePdf":"00089953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075186S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"142","articleId":"89953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":89957,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

A large wavelength chirp in the lasing spectrum was observed for the lasers with high voltage/resistance, even under low-duty-cycle pulse operation. This is thought to be due to resistive heating close to the laser junction.

Due to the high side mode suppression, these devices show different locking properties when compared to lasers with Fabry-Perot structures. The main result is the identification of four regimes for different injection levels. In particular, a symmetrical locking band at low optical injection level is confirmed. The presence of this symmetrical band can be exploited in some applications. As examples, the measurement of the linewidth enhancement factor and the phase-shift-keying modulation capability are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.89994","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00089994.png","startPage":"1688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2982/00089994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.89994","endPage":"1695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Injection locking in distributed feedback semiconductor lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/89994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","displayDocTitle":"Injection locking in distributed feedback semiconductor lasers","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4016834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Injection locking in distributed feedback semiconductor lasers","sourcePdf":"00089994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077852S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"97","articleId":"89994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":89999,"authors":[{"name":"J.-I.
