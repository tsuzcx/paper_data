It is known that solitons of different velocities are transparent to each other. It is shown, through numerical simulation, that such transparency is also maintained in a system using lumped amplifiers, as long as the length of the collision (the distance the solitons travel down the fiber while passing through each other), is long enough relative to the spacing between amplifiers, or to a possibly longer period of variation in some other parameter, such as the fiber's chromatic dispersion.

In these experiments, 10-GHz spaced 100-channel common amplification was carried out in a 622-Mb/s frequency-shift-keying (FSK) direct detection scheme, together with measurement of the amplifier characteristics. Bit-error-rate measurements show that the power-penalty characteristics for 100-channel amplification are the same as for one-channel amplification. Based on the experimental results, possible channel capacity is discussed. There are two possible factors limiting channel capacity in multichannel amplification of fiber amplifiers: signal-gain bandwidth and amplifier noise. Calculations using the amplifier parameters obtained during the experiments reveal that signal gain bandwidth is the main factor limiting channel capacity in the amplifier used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.70014","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"368","endPage":"374","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2454/00070014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.70014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel amplification utilizing an Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Optical amplifiers","Optical fiber polarization","Optical fiber amplifiers","Channel capacity","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Light sources","Crosstalk","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","frequency shift keying","optical communication equipment","optical links","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel number capacity","bit-error-rate measurements","Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifier","multichannel systems","ultimate capacity","100-channel common amplification","frequency-shift-keying","FSK","direct detection scheme","power-penalty characteristics","multichannel amplification","fiber amplifiers","signal-gain bandwidth","amplifier noise","622 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel amplification utilizing an Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifier","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3890545","publicationDate":"March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/70014/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel amplification utilizing an Er/sup 3+/-doped fiber amplifier","sourcePdf":"00070014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047485S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","articleId":"70014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":70015,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

The mapping problem is viewed as one of assigning the nodes of a finite directed acyclic task graph representing the logical and data dependencies among the tasks constituting the algorithm on to the nodes of a finite undirected processor graph denoting the parallel computing architecture so that the completion time of the algorithm is minimized. Two algorithms for solving the mapping problem are presented. The first algorithm is a two-stage heuristic that determines the order of task allocation on the basis of the critical path method and then uses the greedy method to determine the task allocation. The second algorithm uses the idea of pairwise exchange on task allocation order to improve the performance of the greedy heuristic. Extensive computational experiments on hundreds of random graphs show that the heuristic algorithm provides optimal solutions when the ratio of computation time to communication time is very large or very small, and that the pairwise exchange algorithm provides uniformly good mapping for all values of the ratio. The asymptotic optimality of the greedy heuristic algorithm for fork-join task structures is established.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the asymptotic optimality of a heuristic mapping algorithm","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1989.70242","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","pdfPath":"/iel2/796/2456/00070242.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"859 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00070242.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1989.70242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=70242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/70242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the asymptotic optimality of a heuristic mapping algorithm","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3685002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the asymptotic optimality of a heuristic mapping algorithm","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00070242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051687S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","isNumber":"2456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"70242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":70275,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The approach combines the interacting multiple model algorithm with the probabilistic data association filter. The track formation is accomplished by considering two models: one is the true target, with a certain probability of detection P/sub D/; the other is an unobservable target (or no target) with the same model as the former except that P/sub D/=0. The latter represents either a true target outside the sensor coverage or an erroneously hypothesized target. Assuming that the clutter measurements are uniformly distributed, the algorithm yields the true target probability of a track; i.e. it can be called intelligent, since it has a quantitative assessment of whether it has a target in track. The algorithm is useful for low signal-to-noise-ratio situations where the detection threshold has to be set low in order to detect the target, leading to a high rate of false alarms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1989.70372","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","pdfPath":"/iel2/796/2456/00070372.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1408 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1989.70372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic track formation in clutter with a recursive algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Automatic track formation in clutter with a recursive algorithm","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3695197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/70372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic track formation in clutter with a recursive algorithm","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00070372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036386S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","isNumber":"2456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"796","citationCount":"25","articleId":"70372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":70373,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.

The measurements are obtained by a forward-looking infrared imaging sensor. Overlap of target images occurs when the lines of sight of the targets cross. The resulting centroid measurement is a single merged measurement which is a linear combination of the centroids of the individual targets under consideration. Also the ensuing image correlation coefficient matrix for two frames is multimodal and care has to be taken to associate the derived offset measurements with a particular target properly. The overlap of the images for several sampling times causes a dependence of the state estimation errors for the two targets, which has to be taken into account. The joint probabilistic data association merged-measurement coupled filter is employed for state estimation. It performs filtering in a coupled manner for the targets with common measurements. Two filters are examined, one assuming that the displacement noise is white and the other one modeling it correctly as autocorrelated. The latter is shown to yield substantially better performance. The simulation results presented validate the performance predictions for the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1989.70373","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","pdfPath":"/iel2/796/2456/00070373.pdf","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1416 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1989.70373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking of crossing targets with forward looking infrared imaging sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=70373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/70373/","displayDocTitle":"Tracking of crossing targets with forward looking infrared imaging sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3695198","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking of crossing targets with forward looking infrared imaging sensors","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00070373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041489S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","isNumber":"2456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"796","citationCount":"3","articleId":"70373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":70412,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

A multilayer backpropagation neural network is designed and trained to compute the inverse dynamics of a flexible-joint manipulator. This network is implemented in the feedforward path. The main advantage of this scheme is that it does not require any knowledge about the system dynamics and nonlinear characteristics, and therefore it treats the manipulator as a black box. It is shown that the manipulator must be observable to ensure convergence of the neural net training procedure, and some suggestions for selecting manipulator outputs so as to make it observable are proposed.

More importantly and practically, the numerical implementation of the solution procedures exploits inherent parallelism in the load flow equations to be efficiently executed on massively parallel distributed-memory multiprocessors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1989.70552","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00070552.png","startPage":"2173","endPage":"2178 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","pdfPath":"/iel2/796/2456/00070552.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1989.70552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel processing for the load flow of power systems: the approach and applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Load flow","Power systems","Equations","Polynomials","Power system interconnection","Power system modeling","Power system analysis computing","Steady-state","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","parallel algorithms","polynomials","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","homotopy-based computational parallel algorithms","algebraic polynomial equations","polynomial representation","five-bus","seven-bus power system networks","computational complexity","massively parallel distributed-memory multiprocessors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/70552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Parallel processing for the load flow of power systems: the approach and applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3696384","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel processing for the load flow of power systems: the approach and applications","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00070552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040428S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec 1989","isNumber":"2456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"796","citationCount":"35","articleId":"70552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":70561,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.

The author describes the development of a general-purpose automatic vision architecture. He clarifies how, with this architecture, scenic data about boundaries, textures, shading, depth, multiple spatial scales, and motion can be cooperatively synthesized in real time into a coherent representation of three-dimensional form. In order to computationally understand the labile relationships known to occur between recognized emergent segmentations and the seen brightness and colors that result from filling-in, it has been necessary to develop a qualitatively different type of vision theory. This theory provides a fresh analysis of how the human visual system is designed to detect relatively invariant surface colors under variable illumination conditions, to detect relatively invariant object boundary structures amid noise caused by the eye's own optics or occluding objects, and to recognize familiar objects or events in the environment. These three functions are performed by the three main subsystems of the system, the feature contour system, the boundary contour system and the object recognition system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/71242/","accessionNumber":"3706634","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recent results on neural network architectures for vision and pattern recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent results on neural network architectures for vision and pattern recognition","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00071242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024687S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov. 1989","isNumber":"2458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"861","articleId":"71242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":71278,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-L.

A sufficient-input requirement is proposed for neural network applications to dynamic systems based on the system invertibility theory. A lower bound is found which determines the least number of inputs required to excite a neural network designed to learn the inverse of a robotic system. In the proposed combination method of robotic learning control, a nonlinear learning law is first applied on a robotic system to find a desired basin of the output error. Then, using a back-propagation neural network (BPN) to learn the system input-output relation from previously recorded data, an expected control input with respect to the desired task for the robotic system can iteratively be resolved by a learning process. A simulation study has been carried out to verify the convergence of the combination learning method associated with a BPN. From the simulation results, convergence performance has been achieved for the Stanford-like robot arm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1989.71278","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00071278.png","startPage":"200","endPage":"205 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1989.71278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2458","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings., IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel2/861/2458/00071278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On design of nonlinear robotic control system with neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/71278/","displayDocTitle":"On design of nonlinear robotic control system with neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3706667","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Nov 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On design of nonlinear robotic control system with neural networks","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00071278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033962S","chronDate":"14-17 Nov 1989","isNumber":"2458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"861","citationCount":"2","articleId":"71278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":71284,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The central axis is controlled by feedback from higher-level algorithms, allowing the allocation of sampling resources to the region(s) of interest and resulting in greater relevant information from the imager yet permitting considerable reduction in data.

To measure the bit error probability, it is necessary to know the test statistics of the data, jammer, and noise signals at the output of the correlator. It is assumed that the noise is Gaussian with variance N/sup 0/B/sup 0/. If the power of the jammer signal is much higher than that of the noise signal at the output of the correlator, then only the jammer signal is considered as the noise signal.

The computer algorithm follows an optical flow methodology and computes the 2-D interframe linear velocity field of the speckle pattern inside a myocardial region of interest. Each regional velocity (motion) field is then decomposed into meaningful components representing the local myocardial translation, rotation (twist), and biaxial deformation (contraction and thickening). The diagnostic potential of the method is illustrated with a clinical example. The deformation values are in close agreement with manually calculated values obtained from wall thickness and heart circumference measurements from end-diastole to end-systole.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/72583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sep 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3624354","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Local myocardial deformation computed from speckle motion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local myocardial deformation computed from speckle motion","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00072583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027711S","chronDate":"25-28 Sep 1988","isNumber":"2467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"246","citationCount":"12","articleId":"72583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":72591,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

The trigger template is used to define the shaping filter, and the ECG data file is continuously deconvolved with the shaping filter. As beats are accepted into the signal average they are graphically displayed, and a record of individual beat noise estimates is made.

Consequently, there is an important accuracy/speed/cost tradeoff in reciprocal approximation implementations. A reciprocal approximation implementation is discussed, with special attention given to these tradeoffs. An interpolation method is used to ensure that an initial approximation, held in a ROM table, is as accurate as possible. A method for implementing the iteration steps is given. Special instructions are used so that maximum accuracy can be carried between iteration operations. For 64-b floating-point operands (53-b mantissa), a table lookup and only two iterations are required, and high accuracy is maintained. The rounded reciprocal rarely differs from a true round-to-nearest value based on an infinite precision result. When the results do differ (less than once every 1000 calculations), the difference in accuracy is shown to be less than 0.025 of a least significant bit (LSB).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1989.72810","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/480/2471/00072810.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1989.72810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An accurate, high speed implementation of division by reciprocal approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/72810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"An accurate, high speed implementation of division by reciprocal approximation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3648659","publicationDate":"1989","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An accurate, high speed implementation of division by reciprocal approximation","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00072810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054576S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1989","isNumber":"2471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"480","citationCount":"18","articleId":"72810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":72811,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This method successfully avoids the need to generate nontrivial divisor/root multiples (3x, 5x, etc.) and also avoids the complex radix-8 next quotient prediction PLA typically used in a conventional radix-8 SRT division.

As a consequence, the result has to be converted to conventional representation. This conversion can be done on-the-fly as the digits are produced, without the use of a carry-propagate adder. The authors describe how to modify this conversion process so that the result is rounded. The resulting operation is faster than what is done conventionally because no carry-propagate addition is needed.

Previous techniques would require 70 Mb of ROM to implement this processor, which is not feasible for a single-chip implementation. The techniques presented here use a factor of 275 less memory. The key to this is the use of a linear approximation of the nonlinear functions stored in the lookup tables. The functions involved are highly nonlinear in some regions, so variable size regions are used for the approximation. The use of linear approximation alone would still require over 565 kb of ROM. Further compression is obtained by using linear approximation with differential coding of each table. The compression is chosen to minimize ROM size and obtains a further reduction of 55%. A total of 260 kb of ROM is required to implement the processor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm design for a 30-bit integrated logarithmic processor","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1989.72826","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 9th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/480/2471/00072826.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1989.72826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=72826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/72826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm design for a 30-bit integrated logarithmic processor","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3624649","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm design for a 30-bit integrated logarithmic processor","confLoc":"Santa Monica, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00072826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050619S","chronDate":"6-8 Sep 1989","isNumber":"2471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"480","citationCount":"15","articleId":"72826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":72831,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

Overall performance of the system is also reported. The measured data did not match what the authors' model had predicted. The measurements did show the expected zero at DC, the first-order cavity pole at 45 KHz, and the second-order beam resonance at the synchrotron frequency.

Large computational errors can occur when the Levinson algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of this model, because the Toeplitz covariance matrix is ill-suited for inversion. An alternative model is developed based on an incremental difference operator, rather than the shift operator. It is shown that, as the sampling period goes to zero, unlike the standard autoregressive parameters, the coefficients of this model converge to certain parameters that depend directly on the statistics of the continuous-time process. A Levinson-type algorithm for efficiently estimating the parameters of this model is derived. Numerical examples are given to show that when the sampling interval is small this algorithm is considerably less sensitivity to arithmetic roundoff errors than the Levinson algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.73564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2475/00073564.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"321","doi":"10.1109/9.73564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Levinson-type algorithm for modeling fast-sampled data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"A Levinson-type algorithm for modeling fast-sampled data","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3901704","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/73564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Levinson-type algorithm for modeling fast-sampled data","sourcePdf":"00073564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031906S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"58","articleId":"73564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":73569,"authors":[{"name":"Tin-Pui Leung","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Marine Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tin-Pui Leung","id":"37333523600"},{"name":"Qi-Jie Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qi-Jie Zhou","id":"37381887200"},{"name":"Chun-Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Yi Su","id":"37281254400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"73569","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Control design","Nonlinear control systems","Robots","Trajectory","Stability","Sliding mode control","Control systems","Transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reference adaptive control systems","position control","robots","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive variable structure model following control","robot manipulators","trajectory tracking","nonlinear robot system","stability","positive definiteness","inertia matrix","individually stable discontinuity surface","closed loop","transient response","boundary layer"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive variable structure model-following control (AVSMFC) design is proposed for trajectory tracking in a nonlinear robot system which ensures the stability of the intersection of the surfaces without necessarily stabilizing each individual one. The approach avoids the difficulties linked to the strict positive realness requirement in traditional AMFC by taking advantage of the inherent positive definiteness of the manipulator's inertia matrix, and is easily extendible to a higher number of links. The controller does not require any knowledge of a nonlinear robotic system and does not necessarily need the occurrence of a sliding mode at each individually stable discontinuity surface. It thus greatly reduces the complexity of design. In the closed loop, the joint angles asymptotically converge to the reference trajectory with a prescribed transient response. Chattering is eliminated by restricting the state of the system to slide within a boundary layer rather than along the intersection of the surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.73569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2475/00073569.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.73569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2475","startPage":"347","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive variable structure model following control design for robot manipulators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=73569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive variable structure model following control design for robot manipulators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/73569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3901709","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive variable structure model following control design for robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00073569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048967S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"86","articleId":"73569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":73574,"authors":[{"name":"O.L.V.

Under the assumptions of continuity and boundedness of the cost function, it follows that the total discounted cost will also approach the original total cost, at least for epsilon -optimal strategies, which means that the optimal cost of the discretized process should converge to the original optimal cost. The author considers a time discretization so that the new discretized problem (state space and intervention times discretizations) will be finite-dimensional and linear programming (LP) can be used to solve it.

It is shown that recursions or loops in the programs lead to an inherent lower bound on the achievable iteration period, referred to as the iteration bound. A multiprocessor schedule is rate-optimal if the iteration period equals the iteration bound. Systematic unfolding of iterative dataflow programs is proposed, and properties of unfolded dataflow programs are studied. Unfolding increases the number of tasks in a program, unravels the hidden concurrently in iterative dataflow programs, and can reduce the iteration period. A special class of iterative dataflow programs, referred to as perfect-rate programs, is introduced. Each loop in these programs has a single register. Perfect-rate programs can always be scheduled rate optimally (requiring no retiming or unfolding transformation). It is also shown that unfolding any program by an optimum unfolding factor transforms any arbitrary program to an equivalent perfect-rate program, which can then be scheduled rate optimally. This optimum unfolding factor for any arbitrary program is the least common multiple of the number of registers (or delays) in all loops and is independent of the node execution times. An upper bound on the number of processors for rate-optimal scheduling is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.73588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2476/00073588.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.73588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static rate-optimal scheduling of iterative data-flow programs via optimum unfolding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=73588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Static rate-optimal scheduling of iterative data-flow programs via optimum unfolding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/73588/","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3901723","volume":"40","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static rate-optimal scheduling of iterative data-flow programs via optimum unfolding","sourcePdf":"00073588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054499S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"251","articleId":"73588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":73590,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

These graphs are shown to have a partitioning property that is based on Hadamard matrices and can be effectively used for a system's expansion and self-diagnostics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2476/00073594.pdf","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.73594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.73594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2476","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=73594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of odd graphs as fault-tolerant interconnection networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Circuit faults","Containers","Routing","Fault tolerant systems","Resilience","Partitioning algorithms","Symmetric matrices","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["odd graphs","fault-tolerant interconnection networks","ring","star","mesh","binary n-cube","chordal ring","flip-trees","self-routing algorithms","maximal fault tolerance","resilience","persistence","partitioning property","Hadamard matrices","self-diagnostics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/73594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"A study of odd graphs as fault-tolerant interconnection networks","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3901728","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of odd graphs as fault-tolerant interconnection networks","sourcePdf":"00073594.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041936S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","articleId":"73594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":73596,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

Two double-sided linear induction motors with 17 and 9 A starting currents were designed and built to operate with two AC adjustable-frequency motor drives. The motors were intended for use as carts to transfer parts between the three cells in a physical simulator consisting of a load/unload cell, a manufacturing cell, and a turning cell. Experience with a working model confirms that the use of LIMs shows substantial promise for achieving cost and productivity gains in a wide variety of manufacturing systems.

A set of texture measures that quantify several characteristics of the problem space being searched has been developed into heuristics that direct the searches conducted by scheduling agents. The heuristics have been used to direct the searches of a centralized activity-based scheduler, achieving good schedule quality and minimizing the likelihood of backtracking. The model discussed uses textures to direct distributed scheduling, optimizing decisions in the global search space by allowing agents to focus and direct searches in their individual search spaces.

Simulations of the electron trajectories, including thermal velocities, have shown transverse and longitudinal velocity spreads of 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively, for a beam with an alpha of 2.1 and a 1.1 microperveance. The use of an asymmetric field reversal and an initially converging beam greatly reduces the length required for adiabatic compression of the beam. External control of the beam position and angular velocity makes it easy to optimize cyclotron-resonance-maser or peniotron interactions for differing radial cavity modes and cyclotron harmonics. Using this design, the beam radius, guiding center radius, annular width, alpha, and angular velocity can all be varied over a wide range by adjusting the gun electrode voltages and solenoid currents. The result is a short, flexible beamforming system which produces a low-velocity-spread, high-transverse-energy, axis-encircling electron beam. The computer codes used have yielded excellent correlation between simulation and experiment on a wide variety of gun designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1989.74162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2489","startPage":"743","endPage":"746","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/794/2489/00074162.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low velocity spread axis encircling electron beam forming system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/74162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Low velocity spread axis encircling electron beam forming system","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3819649","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low velocity spread axis encircling electron beam forming system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"74162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058661S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isNumber":"2489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"794","citationCount":"18","articleId":"74162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":74182,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Using experiments and simulation, it was shown that the gate structure of DELTA has effective channel controllability and its vertical ultrathin (<0.2- mu m) SOI structure provides superior device characteristics, e.g. the reduction of short channel effects, minimized subthreshold swing, and high transconductance. The DELTA layout is consistent with the conventional ULSI circuit layout. Thus, DELTA offers both consistency with conventional MOSFETs and good scalability As a 3-D device.

Control of either programming voltage or programming time can be used to program the threshold voltage of industry-standard digital EEPROMs to any analog value. Variations in the programming curves of different devices on the same chip as well as changes in the programming curve of a single device with age suggest the need for feedback in any EEPROM-based analog programming strategy. EEPROM charge retention appears to be very good in the analog range and, to first order, temperature compensation of EEPROMs is no more complicated than that for conventional MOS circuits. A particular analog programming scheme which provides about 8 b of resolution per EEPROM device is presented, and the potential uses of EEPROMs in neural net designs are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1989.74274","startPage":"259","endPage":"262","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/794/2489/00074274.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1989.74274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEPROM device as a reconfigurable analog element for neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["EPROM","Neural networks","Threshold voltage","Tunneling","Analog computers","Read only memory","Voltage control","Stability","Silicon compounds","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue storage","compensation","EPROM","integrated memory circuits","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold voltage programming","8 bit resolution","EEPROM device","reconfigurable analog element","neural networks","electrically erasable programmable read-only memories","analog storage","reconfigurable weight storage","programming voltage","programming time","industry-standard digital EEPROMs","feedback","EEPROM-based analog programming strategy","EEPROM charge retention","temperature compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/74274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","displayDocTitle":"EEPROM device as a reconfigurable analog element for neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3799033","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEPROM device as a reconfigurable analog element for neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"74274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060236S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isNumber":"2489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"794","citationCount":"15","articleId":"74274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":74285,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.M.

A detailed comparison is made between these measurements and various models. It is shown that models from the literature fail to describe all observed phenomena. A model is proposed which is shown to provide a good description of the measured heavy-doping effects on recombination. The model describes the experimentally observed voltage and temperature dependence of both the nonideal forward and the reverse currents without the introduction of fitting parameters. It is shown that, for zero-bias depletion widths between 300 AA and about 700 AA, trap-assisted tunneling is important for reverse-biased junctions at room temperature. For zero-bias depletion widths less than 300 AA, the tunneling effects increase dramatically. Whereas trap-assisted tunneling has to be taken into account for the forward characteristic, the reverse characteristic is dominated by band-to-band tunneling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1989.74285","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/794/2489/00074285.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1989.74285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2489","startPage":"307","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new recombination model describing heavy-doping effects and low-temperature behaviour","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=74285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new recombination model describing heavy-doping effects and low-temperature behaviour","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/74285/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3787450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new recombination model describing heavy-doping effects and low-temperature behaviour","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"74285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03252S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isNumber":"2489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"794","citationCount":"32","articleId":"74285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":74311,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Delay time reduction by around 100 ps is achieved by introducing a proposed base electrode surround emitter transistor (BEST). Two types of gates, CBiCMOS and BiNMOS, provide shorter gate delays and higher drivabilities than the CMOS gate even with V/sub s/, of 3.3 V. It is concluded that the innovations in the bipolar transistor structure BEST and in the CBiCMOS and BiNMOS gate circuit configuration are highly promising in comparison to CMOS ULSIs for future high-speed and high-density ULSIs operating at scaled supply voltages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/794/2489/00074314.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1989.74314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1989.74314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=74314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Future BiCMOS technology for scaled supply voltage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Voltage","Electrodes","CMOS technology","Delay effects","Capacitance","Laboratories","Electron emission","Ultra large scale integration","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BIMOS integrated circuits","delays","integrated circuit technology","logic gates","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay time reduction","BiCMOS technology","scaled supply voltage","base electrode surround emitter transistor","CBiCMOS","shorter gate delays","higher drivabilities","CMOS gate","BiNMOS gate circuit configuration","CMOS ULSIs","3.3 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/74314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Future BiCMOS technology for scaled supply voltage","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3787473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future BiCMOS technology for scaled supply voltage","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"74314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033018S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isNumber":"2489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"794","citationCount":"42","articleId":"74314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":74317,"authors":[{"name":"F.K.

Boron penetration results in large positive shifts in V/sub FB/, increased p-channel subthreshold slope and electron trapping rate, and decreased low-field mobility and interface trap density. Inclusion of a phosphorus coimplant or TiSi/sub 2/ salicide is shown to minimize this effect. The boron penetration phenomenon is modeled by the creation of a very shallow, fully depleted p-type layer in the silicon substrate close to the SiO/sub 2/-Si interface.

The programming by source-side injection makes it possible for the drain junction to be optimized independently of hot electron generation and for the erasure to be achieved with no degradation in programmability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/794/2489/00074353.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new flash-erase EEPROM cell with a sidewall select-gate on its source side","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1989.74353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1989.74353","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=74353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/74353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","displayDocTitle":"A new flash-erase EEPROM cell with a sidewall select-gate on its source side","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3831972","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new flash-erase EEPROM cell with a sidewall select-gate on its source side","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"74353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032875S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 1989","isNumber":"2489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"794","citationCount":"26","articleId":"74353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":74361,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

These effects are the formation of a parasitic electron barrier due to a nonabrupt base-emitter junction and the reduction of the density of states in the Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ base layer because of the anisotropic strain. Junction spacers have been found to eliminate the parasitic barriers for optimum devices. For optimum device performance it is necessary to keep the Si-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ interfaces in the junction depletion region.

From the numerical calculation it is found that the far-field beam pattern is little affected by random failures of up to 20% of the laser diodes with reference of 80% receiving efficiency in the center spot. The random differences in phases among laser diodes due to probable manufacturing errors is allowed to about 0.2 times the wavelength. The maximum allowable orientation error is about 20% of the diffraction angle of a single laser diode aperture ( approximately 1 cm).

This design builds on some of the ideas that have been developed for ICs that integrate signal-processing circuitry with photosensors. In the case of light-stripe range finding, the increase in cell complexity from sensing only to sensing and processing makes the modification of the operational principle of range finding practical, which in turn results in a dramatic improvement in performance. The IC array of photosensor and analog signal processor cells that acquires 1000 frames of light-stripe range data per second-two orders of magnitude faster than conventional light-stripe range-finding methods. The highly parallel range-finding algorithm used requires that the output of each photosensor site be continuously monitored.

Unlike switched-capacitor (SC) circuits, SI circuits require only a standard digital CMOS process. SI circuits use MOS transistors as the storage elements to provide analog memory capability. Similar to the operation of dynamic logic circuits, a voltage is sampled onto the gate of a MOSFET and held on its noncritical gate capacitance. The held voltage signal on the gate causes a corresponding held current signal in the drain, usually proportional to the square of the gate-to-source voltage. Design issues related to the implementation and performance of SI circuits are presented. SI filters show comparable performance to SC filters except in terms of passband accuracy. The major source of error is nonunity current gain in the SI integrator due to device mismatch and clock-feedthrough effects.

This BiCMOS op amp offers an infinite input resistance, a DC gain of 100 dB, a unity-gain frequency of 90 MHz with 45 degrees phase margin, and a slew rate of 150 V/ mu s. The differential output range is 12 V. The circuit is operated from a +or-5-V power supply and dissipates 125 mW. The op amp is unity-gain stable with 7 pF of capacitive loading at each output. The op amp is a two-stage, pole-split frequency compensated design that uses a PMOS input stage for infinite input resistance and an n-p-n bipolar second stage for high gain and high bandwidth. The frequency compensation network serves both the differential- and common-mode amplifiers so the differential- and common-mode amplifier dynamics are similar.

The flexibility of an FPGA is determined by the number and distribution of switches used in the interconnection. While good routability can be obtained with a high flexibility, a large number of switches will result in poor performance and logical density because each switch has significant delay and area. The minimum number of switches required to achieve good routability is determined by implementing several industrial circuits in a variety of interconnection architectures. These experiments indicate that high flexibility is essential for the connection block that joins the logic blocks to the routing channel, but a relative low flexibility is sufficient for switch blocks at the junction of horizontal and vertical channels. Furthermore, it is necessary to use only a few more routing tracks than the absolute minimum possible with structures of surprisingly low flexibility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Switches","Integrated circuit interconnections","Routing","Design automation","Logic devices","Delay","Switching circuits","Helium","Programmable logic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnection structures","field-programmable gate arrays","routability","switches","logical density","delay","interconnection architectures","connection block","switch blocks","routing tracks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75006","doi":"10.1109/4.75006","startPage":"277","endPage":"282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2493/00075006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75006/","displayDocTitle":"Flexibility of interconnection structures for field-programmable gate arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3911421","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexibility of interconnection structures for field-programmable gate arrays","sourcePdf":"00075006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053718S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"144","articleId":"75006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":75011,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In order to analyze an interconnect containing N signal conductors, they derive closed-form formulas to determine its transfer functions, and they apply the inverse Fourier transform to obtain its time-domain pulse response functions. Two types of equivalent circuit models can be formulated once the pulse response functions of the interconnect are found. The circuit schematics of the models depend on the number of the signal conductors, irrespective of the physical parameters of the interconnect. These models are compatible with standard circuit simulation tools since they consist of linear resistive networks and linear-dependent sources only. Two example circuits are studied to examine the accuracy and efficiency of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2493/00075011.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.75011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75011","startPage":"319","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk and transient analyses of high-speed interconnects and packages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75011/","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk and transient analyses of high-speed interconnects and packages","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3911426","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk and transient analyses of high-speed interconnects and packages","sourcePdf":"00075011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038481S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","articleId":"75011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":75012,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

New placement algorithms implemented in KOAN handle complex layout symmetries, dynamic merging and abutment of individual devices, and flexible generation of wells and bulk constants. New routing algorithms implemented in ANAGRAM II handle arbitrary gridless design rules in addition to over-the-device, crosstalk-avoiding, mirror-symmetric, and self-symmetric wiring.

A gate-level symbolic expression, the logic transformation diagram, is adopted as a layout input. A mask layout is automatically generated from the symbolic expression. A hierarchical design method is used in combination with a bit-slice regular structure and a performance-determining irregular structure. A 1-b field of the bit-slice structure is designed symbolically and then compacted, and finally the entire data path is generated. Performance-determining irregular macrocells, such as adders with carry-look-ahead (CLA) circuits, are handcrafted independently and combined with the entire data path at the final step. To achieve high density and high performance, effort is focused on optimizing the layout of the 1-b field. Iteration of the editing and compaction loop can be executed in a short turnaround time (TAT). By the proposed methodology, a data path containing 21 K transistors in a 32-b microprocessor has been successfully produced. Design productivity has been increased tenfold, achieving a layout density equivalent to that of the handcrafted design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical symbolic design methodology for large-scale data paths","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.75017","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2493/00075017.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical symbolic design methodology for large-scale data paths","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911432","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical symbolic design methodology for large-scale data paths","sourcePdf":"00075017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068042S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"75017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75019,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The method overcomes the limitation of traditional simulation-based verification techniques. It is based on a stepwise bottom-up reconstruction of large architecture building blocks, starting from the layout. Using a pattern matcher, the simplest cells in the transistor netlist, such as inverters, NAND gates, etc., are identified first. Then the pattern matcher is used again to find the next level of cells, such as memory cells, flip-flops, etc. Reconstruction of more and more complex structures takes place, until the architecture level is reached. To be able to communicate instances of parametrized library modules, the parameters have to define the module's connectivity in a unique way. For every module, a controller can then be established which guides the reconstruction process. When the design is correct, the reconstruction will succeed. On the other hand, if at some point the reconstruction fails, this indicates incorrect connectivity at that point.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.75019","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2493/00075019.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic verification of library-based IC designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Automatic verification of library-based IC designs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911434","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic verification of library-based IC designs","sourcePdf":"00075019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104995S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"12","articleId":"75019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":75032,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The chip was designed for a maximum sampling frequency of 80 MHz, under worst-case conditions. The desired throughput rate is achieved by applying a pipelined carry-save arithmetic. Although an optimized pipeline scheme was used, the chip complexity leads to a high capacitive clock load. The synchronization problems and the switching noise problems resulting from this high clock load were solved by dividing the clock system into subsystems and introducing and intended clock skew between the subsystems and by applying a power supply concept in which the global supply lines are consistently routed in a sandwich structure to create an on-chip buffer capacitance. The chip contains 160000 transistors on a silicon area of 78 mm/sup 2/.

A complementary current sensing scheme is proposed to reduce data transmission delay. A speed improvement of 20 ns was achieved when utilizing a 1.5-V power supply. An accurate and speed-enhanced half-V/sub CC/ voltage generator with a current-mirror amplifier and tri-state buffer is proposed. With it, a response time reduction of about 1.5 decades was realized. A word-line driver with a charge-pump circuit was developed to achieve a high boost ratio. A ratio of about 1.8 was obtained from a power supply voltage as low as 1.0 V. A 1.28 mu m/sup 2/ crown-shaped stacked-capacitor (CROWN) cell was also made to ensure a sufficient storage charge and to minimize data-line interference noise. An experimental 1.5 V 64 Mb DRAM was designed and fabricated with these technologies and 0.3 mu m electron-beam lithography. A typical access time of 70 ns was obtained, and a further reduction of 50 ns is expected based on simulation results. Thus, a high-speed performance, comparable to that of 16-Mb DRAMs, can be achieved with a typical power dissipation of 44 mW, one tenth that of 16-Mb DRAMs. This indicates that a low-voltage battery operation is a promising target for future DRAMs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.75040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075040.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental 1.5-V 64-Mb DRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"An experimental 1.5-V 64-Mb DRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75040/","publicationDate":"April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3920099","volume":"26","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental 1.5-V 64-Mb DRAM","sourcePdf":"00075040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043243S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"145","articleId":"75040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75041,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This sensing scheme provides folded bit-line sensing operation in a crosspoint-type memory cell array. The DSB scheme offers a high-density DRAM memory core with the common-mode array noise eliminated. A bit-line architecture based on this new sensing principle and its operation are demonstrated. A divided/pausing bit-line sensing (DIPS) scheme, which is an application of this DSB principle to the conventional folded bit-line type of memory cell arrangement, is also proposed. The DIPS architecture achieves complete pausing states for alternate bit lines throughout the active period. These alternate pausing bit lines shield the inter-bit-line coupling noise between active bit lines. Here the inter-bit-line coupling noise is eliminated by a slight architectural change to the conventional folded bit-line memory cell array. These new memory core design alternatives provide high-density DRAM memory cores suitable for the 64-Mb level and beyond. with the memory array noise reduced significantly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.75041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075041.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A divided/shared bit-line sensing scheme for ULSI DRAM cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"A divided/shared bit-line sensing scheme for ULSI DRAM cores","volume":"26","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3920100","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75041/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A divided/shared bit-line sensing scheme for ULSI DRAM cores","sourcePdf":"00075041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032858S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"75041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":75042,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A simple analysis shows that major speed improvements are possible when using current-mode rather than conventional voltage-mode signal transporting techniques. The key to this approach is the use of low-resistance current-signal circuits to drastically reduce the impedance level and the voltage swings on long interconnect lines. As an example, a simple four-transistor current-sense amplifier for fast CMOS SRAMs is proposed. The circuit presents a virtual short circuit to the bit lines, thus reducing the sensing delay, which is rendered practically insensitive to the bit-line capacitance. In addition, the virtual short circuit ensures equal bit-line voltages, thus eliminating the need for bit-line equalization during a read access.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Voltage","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","Driver circuits","Inverters","Signal analysis","Capacitance","Impedance","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","delays","integrated circuit technology","integrated memory circuits","SRAM chips","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static RAM","memory IC","high-speed VLSI circuits","current sense amplifier","signal delay","interconnect lines","speed improvements","current-mode","low-resistance current-signal circuits","fast CMOS SRAMs","bit-line capacitance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75050","doi":"10.1109/4.75050","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75050","startPage":"525","endPage":"536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-mode techniques for high-speed VLSI circuits with application to current sense amplifier for CMOS SRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Current-mode techniques for high-speed VLSI circuits with application to current sense amplifier for CMOS SRAM's","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3920109","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-mode techniques for high-speed VLSI circuits with application to current sense amplifier for CMOS SRAM's","sourcePdf":"00075050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044193S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"174","articleId":"75050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":75052,"authors":[{"name":"T.N.

This multiplier is intended to be applied to double-precision floating-point data processing based on the IEEE standard up to clock range of 100 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"600","endPage":"606","doi":"10.1109/4.75061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75061","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075061.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10 ns 54*54 b parallel structured full array multiplier with 0.5 mu m CMOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 10 ns 54*54 b parallel structured full array multiplier with 0.5 mu m CMOS technology","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3920119","volume":"26","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10 ns 54*54 b parallel structured full array multiplier with 0.5 mu m CMOS technology","sourcePdf":"00075061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107177S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"87","articleId":"75061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75062,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

With this technique, the sampling error resulting from input-dependent charge injection of the sampling switch is significantly attenuated by sampling the input voltage onto a capacitance that is small during the sample mode but is, in effect, increased during the transition to the hold mode through the action of Miller feedback. The technique thus allows for a high sampling speed without the precision penalty traditionally associated with open-loop sample-and-hold circuits. A sample-and-hold circuit based on the proposed approach has been designed and fabricated in a 1- mu m CMOS technology, and an order-of-magnitude of reduction in the input-dependent charge injection has been demonstrated experimentally. This prototype circuit is capable of sampling an input to a precision of 8 b with an acquisition time of 5 ns. The experimental sample-and-hold circuit operates from a single 5-V supply and dissipates 26.5 mW.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.75067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075067.pdf","startPage":"643","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed sample-and-hold technique using a Miller hold capacitance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75067/","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed sample-and-hold technique using a Miller hold capacitance","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3911448","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed sample-and-hold technique using a Miller hold capacitance","sourcePdf":"00075067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056194S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"67","articleId":"75067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":75068,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is particularly important for single-chip reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors to include large, high-speed memories, because RISC chips must reduce off-chip memory delays to achieve the shortest possible cycle time. The use of dynamic RAM for all on-chip cache results in all important increased density of local memory for a given scarce chip area, but complicates the processor control due to the inherent requirement for refreshing. By using simple circuit techniques and making a few modifications to cache organization, the refreshing requirement of dynamic RAM can be eliminated. This new cache design approach is described. It makes use of a selective invalidation technique that invalidates only those cache entries that are not fresh. This is accomplished without interrupting the processor execution stream and without degrading the cache performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.75069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2494/00075069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.75069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"657","endPage":"661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using cache mechanisms to exploit nonrefreshing DRAMs for on-chip memories","volume":"26","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3920124","publicationDate":"April 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cache mechanisms to exploit nonrefreshing DRAMs for on-chip memories","sourcePdf":"00075069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02428S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","articleId":"75069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75073,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The receiver signal-processing needs are outlined, and the limitations of digital signal processing in terms of the overall receiver signal processing needs are discussed. Options and tradeoffs at the receiver and channelizer technology levels are discussed. Promising channelizer technologies, including components, that have been or potentially may be implemented with small volumes and moderate dynamic range are described. Parallel signal-processing methods, architectural techniques, and hardware for channelized receiver technologies that can be implemented in a small volume (tens of channels per in/sup 3/) with a moderately high dynamic range (>50 dB) are discussed.

Three different differential detectors (including the FM-discriminator followed by integrate-sample-and-dump filter) and a novel coherent detector are discussed. The degradation caused by the frequency offset between the local oscillator and the unmodulated carrier in the baseband differential detector is studied. The performance of both coherently and differentially detected pi /4-QPSK in a Gaussian channel is also studied. It is shown that with a frequency offset of more than 3% of the symbol rate, the performance degradation is more than 1 dB at 10/sup -4/. The out-of-band power of the nonlinearly amplified bandlimited pi /4-QPSK signals is reduced from -13 dB to -37 dB if a 2-dB output back-off amplifier is used instead of a hardlimiter. The performance of the pi /4-QPSK is equivalent to that of QPSK, although the pi /4-QPSK has the advantage of less spectrum restoration after nonlinear amplification. The coherent demodulator and differential decoder avoid the three-level detection and achieve the same bit-error-rate (BER) performance as DEQPSK with a simple circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.75121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/2497/00075121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.75121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2497","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"pi /4-QPSK modems for satellite sound/data broadcast systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"pi /4-QPSK modems for satellite sound/data broadcast systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911453","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"pi /4-QPSK modems for satellite sound/data broadcast systems","sourcePdf":"00075121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026843S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"27","articleId":"75121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75122,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The bit-error rate (BER) performance of the pi /4-QPSK with NEC is analyzed and evaluated in a fast Rician fading and additive white Gaussian noise. (AWGN) environment using computer simulation. It is demonstrated that with simple electronics the performance of a noncoherently detected pi /4-QPSK signal in both AWGN and fast Rician fading can be improved. When the K-factor (a ratio of average power of multipath signal to direct path power) of the Rician channel decreases, the improvement increases. An improvement of 1.2 dB could be obtained at a BER of 10/sup -4/ in the AWGN channel. This performance gain is achieved without requiring any signal redundancy and additional bandwidth. Three types of noncoherent detection schemes of pi /4QPSK with NEC structure, such as intermediate frequency band differential detection, baseband differential detection, and FM discriminator, are discussed. It is concluded that the pi /4-QPSK with NEC is an attractive scheme for power-limited satellite land-mobile broadcasting systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.75122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/2497/00075122.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.75122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2497","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved pi /4-QPSK with nonredundant error correction for satellite mobile broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved pi /4-QPSK with nonredundant error correction for satellite mobile broadcasting","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911454","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved pi /4-QPSK with nonredundant error correction for satellite mobile broadcasting","sourcePdf":"00075122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060896S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"3","articleId":"75122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75137,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The gate electrode surrounds the crowded multipillar silicon islands. Because all the sidewalls of the pillars are used effectively as the transistor channel, the M-SGT has a high-shrinkage feature. The area occupied by the M-SGT can be shrunk to less than 30% of that occupied by the planar transistor. The small occupied area and the mesh-structured gate electrode lead to the small junction capacitance and the small gate electrode RC delay, resulting in high-speed operation. The fabrication of the M-SGT CMOS inverter chain is discussed. The propagation delay reduces to 40%, compared with the planar transistor inverter chain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.75169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.75169","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2499/00075169.pdf","startPage":"579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-pillar surrounding gate transistor (M-SGT) for compact and high-speed circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75169/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-pillar surrounding gate transistor (M-SGT) for compact and high-speed circuits","volume":"38","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3911477","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-pillar surrounding gate transistor (M-SGT) for compact and high-speed circuits","sourcePdf":"00075169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035042S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"67","articleId":"75169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":75172,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Intervalley deformation potentials significantly lower than those which have been previously reported are needed to reproduce available experimental data.

A two-step annealing process is used after deposition of the Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ film by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The first step is ozone (O/sub 3/) annealing with ultraviolet light irradiation, which is the most effective means of reducing leakage current. A model for explaining the effectiveness of the UV-O/sub 3/ annealing treatment is proposed. Excited oxygen atoms in the singlet state (/sup 1/D), which are generated selectively in the ozone gas irradiated by a mercury lamp, repair the oxygen vacancies existing in the as-deposited CVD-Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ film, resulting in a marked reduction of the film's leakage current. The second step is dry-O/sub 2/ annealing, which reduces the defect density of initial breakdown. Sufficient capacitance can be obtained while maintaining a low leakage current and sufficient step coverage for a 1.5-V supply-voltage 64-Mb DRAM having a high-aspect three-dimensional memory cell.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2499/00075185.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UV-O/sub 3/ and dry-O/sub 2/: Two-step-annealed chemical vapor-deposited Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ films for storage dielectrics of 64-Mb DRAMs","doi":"10.1109/16.75185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.75185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75185/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"UV-O/sub 3/ and dry-O/sub 2/: Two-step-annealed chemical vapor-deposited Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ films for storage dielectrics of 64-Mb DRAMs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911461","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UV-O/sub 3/ and dry-O/sub 2/: Two-step-annealed chemical vapor-deposited Ta/sub 2/O/sub 5/ films for storage dielectrics of 64-Mb DRAMs","sourcePdf":"00075185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058676S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"186","articleId":"75185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75213,"authors":[{"name":"E.G.

Device physics and architecture are incorporated into the analysis through a numerical charge-injection model which is used to compute the potential and carrier-density distributions. Theoretical results are presented to demonstrate the charge injection characteristic of some typical device structures. The effects that the injection method, the epitaxial layer structure and the acoustic wave amplitude have on device performances are discussed.

Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures are examined numerically to show the influence of connection lines and different materials on the heat transport. Correct boundary conditions for device simulation and analytical expressions for compact models are derived. Designers of short- and narrow-channel devices should be aware of an error in the range of 10% due to neglecting the influence of the interconnection lines. Test devices may not be typical for a device in VLSI circuits, as their thermal resistances may be significantly lower. Device parameters should be extracted from pulsed measurements and at raised ambient temperature. Pads should be kept at least 100 mu m away from the test devices. Thermal resistances of SOI devices are not significantly larger than the resistances of bulk devices under VLSI conditions and will be about one order of magnitude larger under test conditions. The absolute value can be calculated from a simple formula that is verified by numerical simulations. Bulk and SOI technologies are compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.75217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.75217","endPage":"875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2500/00075217.pdf","startPage":"871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of heat transfer in SOI-MOSFETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75217/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of heat transfer in SOI-MOSFETs","volume":"38","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3911521","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of heat transfer in SOI-MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00075217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077187S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"65","articleId":"75217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":75218,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

This process features an aggressive interwell isolation module which allows scaling of the n/sup +/ to p/sup +/ space to less than 2 mu m and an advanced framed-mask poly-buffered LOCOS isolation (FMPBL) which reduces field oxide encroachment and the transistor narrow-width effect and provides a 1.2- mu m active pitch. Transistors are fabricated with a 125-A gate oxide and a dual n/sup +//p/sup +/ source/drain implanted polysilicon gates to provide excellent short-channel behavior down to 0.3- mu m effective channel length. Transistor design is optimized to reduce the polysilicon gate bird's beak and lightly doped drain (LDD) underdiffusion. For PMOS transistors, boron diffusion through the gate oxide is minimized by replacing BF/sub 2/ with B/sup 11/ for the p/sup +/ S/D implant. A titanium salicide process provides strapping between n/sup +//p/sup +/ polysilicon gates and lower sheet and contact resistances. The back-end features three levels of metallization and polysilicon contact plugs. Discrete transistor lifetimes for DC hot-carrier degradation are in excess of 10 years at 3.3-V operation. A 16 K* 4 SRAM displayed no parametric shifts after hot-carrier stressing for 1000 h at 7-V and 0 degrees C. This is consistent with a lifetime of greater than 10 years at 3.3-V operation. Ring oscillator delay times of 85 ps at 3.3-V and 65 ps at 5-V supply are achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3911522","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance half-micrometer generation CMOS technology for fast SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance half-micrometer generation CMOS technology for fast SRAMs","sourcePdf":"00075218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069283S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"7","articleId":"75218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75219,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The exponential rate of decrease in type II probability of error under a constraint on the minimal rate of decrease in type I probability of error is chosen for a criterion of optimality. Using large deviations estimates, a decision rule that is based on the relative entropy of the empirical measure with respect to P/sub 1/ is proposed. In the case of discrete random variables, this approach yields weaker results than the combinatorial approach used by Hoeffding (1965). However, it enables the analysis to be extended to the general case of R/sup n/-valued random variables. Finally, the results are extended to the case where P/sub 1/ is an unknown parameter-dependent distribution that is known to belong to a set of distributions (P/sup 0//sub 1/, theta in Theta ).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2501/00075244.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.75244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.75244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On universal hypotheses testing via large deviations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Random variables","Entropy","Prototypes","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","information theory","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability","optimality criterion","universal hypotheses testing","large deviations","i.i.d. sequence","random variables","decision rule","relative entropy","discrete random variables"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"On universal hypotheses testing via large deviations","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911548","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On universal hypotheses testing via large deviations","sourcePdf":"00075244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026844S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","articleId":"75244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":75246,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

Monte Carlo simulations, also known as simple averaging, have been used as a direct means of estimation. A technique known as importance sampling can be used to modify the simulation via weighted averaging in the hope that the estimate will converge more rapidly to the expected value than standard Monte Carlo simulations. A constrained optimal solution to the problem of minimizing the variance of the importance sampling estimator is derived. This is accomplished by finding the distribution which is closest to the unconstrained optimal solution in the Ali-Silvey sense (S. Ali et al., 1966). The solution from the constraint class is shown to be the least favorable density function in terms of Bayes risk against the optimal density function. Examples of constraint classes, which include epsilon -mixture, show that the constrained optimal solution can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal solution. Applications to estimating probability of error in communication systems are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2501/00075246.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.75246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.75246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained solutions in importance via robust statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Statistics","Monte Carlo methods","Density functional theory","Sampling methods","Error analysis","Communication systems","Data analysis","Stochastic processes","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","information theory","Monte Carlo methods","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability","robust statistics","random vectors","Monte Carlo simulations","weighted averaging","constrained optimal solution","importance sampling estimator","density function","communication systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Constrained solutions in importance via robust statistics","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911550","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained solutions in importance via robust statistics","sourcePdf":"00075246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049871S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","articleId":"75246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":75248,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

It is shown that the even weight subcodes of the shortened binary Hamming codes form a sequence of repeated-root cyclic codes that are optimal. In nearly all other cases, one does not find good cyclic codes by dropping the usual restriction that n and q must be relatively prime. This statement is based on an analysis for lengths up to 100. A theorem shows why this was to be expected, but it also leads to low-complexity decoding methods. This is an advantage, especially for the codes that are not much worse than corresponding codes of odd length. It is demonstrated that a binary cyclic code of length 2n (n odd) can be obtained from two cyclic codes of length n by the well-known mod u mod u+v mod construction. This leads to an infinite sequence of optimal cyclic codes with distance 4. Furthermore, it is shown that low-complexity decoding methods can be used for these codes. The structure theorem generalizes to other characteristics and to other lengths. Some comparisons of the methods using earlier examples are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeated-root cyclic codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.75250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2501/00075250.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.75250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Repeated-root cyclic codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911554","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeated-root cyclic codes","sourcePdf":"00075250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110918S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"114","articleId":"75250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":75251,"authors":[{"name":"C.T.

The Viterbi algorithm is modified to correct insertions and deletions as well as errors, still using a trellis diagram that has the same number of states as the FSM that generates the uncorrupted data. Two problems are examined. In the first problem the data is given in the traditional form of a string so the novel aspect is that insertions and deletions are now corrected. In the second problem, a unique string need not be given, but a regular language is given, and any string belonging to the regular language is a possible data string. Again, deletion addition, and changes of symbols are corrected. A direct generalization of the Viterbi decoding algorithm is thus proved to be an efficient technique for solving a much wider class of problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911574","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two extensions of the Viterbi algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two extensions of the Viterbi algorithm","sourcePdf":"00075270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039783S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"75270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75279,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Comparison with their analytic counterparts reveals the presence and origin of vector parasites. For the double-curl and penalty methods, the dispersion relations are double-valued, admitting an extra, spurious dispersion surface of real-valued wavenumbers. As a result, low wavenumbers support well-resolved and poorly resolved vector parasites. The Helmholtz schemes have monotonic, single-valued dispersion relations for divergence-free physical modes. Specification of divergence-free boundary conditions is sufficient to guarantee the absence of parasites. The primitive schemes have single-valued but folded (nonmonotonic) dispersion relations, supporting poorly resolved vector parasites at low wavenumbers. Use of a staggered finite-difference grid eliminates these parasites and results in a dispersion relation identical to that for the Helmholtz scheme. In cases where vector parasites arise, the same essential weakness in the discretized form of either the first or cross-derivative is responsible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.75279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2502/00075279.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.75279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"383","endPage":"394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Origin of vector parasites in numerical Maxwell solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Origin of vector parasites in numerical Maxwell solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75279/","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911577","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Origin of vector parasites in numerical Maxwell solutions","sourcePdf":"00075279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051421S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"77","articleId":"75279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":75282,"authors":[{"name":"W.P.

It therefore seems likely that the algebraic problem can be solved by sparse techniques, which would make the method applicable to even more complicated geometries at a modest computational cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.75292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/2502/00075292.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.75292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2502","startPage":"501","endPage":"505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Covariant-projection quadrilateral elements for the analysis of waveguides with sharp edges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Covariant-projection quadrilateral elements for the analysis of waveguides with sharp edges","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3911590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Covariant-projection quadrilateral elements for the analysis of waveguides with sharp edges","sourcePdf":"00075292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049845S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"75292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75293,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

A variational form is obtained by using a self-adjoint susceptance operator which is defined in terms of two eigenmode sets corresponding to the two constituent waveguides. Utilizing the similarity between the field and network theory allows the use of the accessible and localized modes, resulting in a final admittance matrix that is small in size. This formulation leads to an appreciable reduction in the computation time and computer memory space. thereby facilitating the use of the optimization process on personal computers and workstations. Examples for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous waveguide discontinuity problems are given, showing good agreement with the experiments.

The 16 masking modes select 1, 3, 5 or 9 pixels of a 5*3 pixel field for filtering. This feature makes it possible to median-filter NTSC composite video (baseband) or component R, G, and B signals. The input threshold value and the SWAP signal (indicating substitution of the median value) can be used together to adapt transmission path conditions. The circuit removes impulsive noise caused by FM-carrier-to-noise degradation, common in cable and satellite TV systems. The filter is applicable to other impulse noise sources created by auto engines and household appliances, and is also generally useful in image and signal processing tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/2504/00075377.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.75377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.75377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2504","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI median filter for impulse noise elimination in composite or component TV signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Circuit noise","Adaptive filters","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Filtering","Baseband","Degradation","Cable TV","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital filters","interference suppression","video signals","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite TV signals","RGB signals","cable TV","image processing","CMOS","digital filters","impulse noise elimination","component TV signals","VLSI median filter","masking modes","adaptive threshold control","NTSC composite video","baseband","FM-carrier-to-noise degradation","satellite TV systems","impulse noise sources","auto engines","household appliances","signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1988","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI median filter for impulse noise elimination in composite or component TV signals","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1988","accessionNumber":"3152791","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI median filter for impulse noise elimination in composite or component TV signals","sourcePdf":"00075377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076776S","chronDate":"Feb 1988","isNumber":"2504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"29","articleId":"75377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75394,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The novel feature of the unfolding technique lies in the generation of functionally correct control circuits in the digit-serial architectures. For some applications bit-serial architectures may be too slow, and bit-parallel architectures may be faster than necessary and may require too much hardware. The desired sample rate in these applications can be achieved using the digit-serial approach, where multiple bits of a sample are processed in a single clock cycle. The number of bits processed in one clock cycle in the digit-serial systems is referred to as the digit size; the digit size can be any arbitrary integer (the digit size was restricted to be a divisor of wordlength in past ad hoc designs). Digit-serial implementation of two's complement adders and multipliers is described. Least-significant-bit-first bit-serial implementation of two's complement division, square-root, and compare-select operations are presented, and the corresponding digit-serial architectures for these operations are obtained using the unfolding algorithm. Unfolding of multiple-rate operations (such as interpolators and decimators) is also addressed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.75394","startPage":"358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2505/00075394.pdf","endPage":"375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.75394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75394/","displayDocTitle":"A systematic approach for design of digit-serial signal processing architectures","volume":"38","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3920424","publicationDate":"April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic approach for design of digit-serial signal processing architectures","sourcePdf":"00075394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044289S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"145","articleId":"75394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75395,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

The emphasis is on PCLWSE filters with equiripple passbands and peak-constrained least-squares (PCLS) stopbands. The stopband energy is minimized subject to a constraint on the maximum stopband gain. A design algorithm is presented, and examples are discussed. Each example provides the unique optimal solution to the corresponding design problem. The tradeoff between the peak stopband gain and the total stopband energy is examined. It is shown that the most inefficient filters have minimax or least-squares stopbands. In particular, the stopband energy for minimax filters can be significantly reduced with almost no change in the peak stopband gain. Also, the peak stopband gain for filters with least-squares stopbands can be significantly reduced with almost no change in the total stopband energy. These results are supported by mathematical analysis, and examples are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.75395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.75395","startPage":"376","endPage":"388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/2505/00075395.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FIR digital filters with least-squares stopbands subject to peak-gain constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"FIR digital filters with least-squares stopbands subject to peak-gain constraints","publicationDate":"April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3920425","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75395/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FIR digital filters with least-squares stopbands subject to peak-gain constraints","sourcePdf":"00075395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033334S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"158","articleId":"75395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":75397,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Unlike most other requirements analysis tools, which start from a formal description language, the focus of the RA is on the transition between informal and formal specifications. The RA supports the earliest phases of creating a requirement, in which ambiguity, contradiction, and incompleteness are inevitable. From an artificial intelligence perspective, the central problem the RA faces is one of knowledge acquisition. The RA develops a coherent internal representation of a requirement from an initial set of disorganized imprecise statements. To do so, the RA relies on a variety of techniques, including dependency-directed reasoning, hybrid knowledge representations and the reuse of common forms (cliches). An annotated transcript showing an interaction with a working version of the RA is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/2506/00075413.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Requirements Apprentice: automated assistance for requirements acquisition","doi":"10.1109/32.75413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.75413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"The Requirements Apprentice: automated assistance for requirements acquisition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3920450","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Requirements Apprentice: automated assistance for requirements acquisition","sourcePdf":"00075413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055855S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"162","articleId":"75413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":75415,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Expressions for the z-transforms of the sampled B-spline functions are determined and a convolution property of these kernels is established. It is shown that both the direct and indirect spline transforms involve linear operators that are space invariant and are implemented efficiently by linear filtering. Fast computational algorithms based on the recursive implementations of these filters are proposed. A B-spline interpolator can also be characterized in terms of its transfer function and its global impulse response (cardinal spline of order n). The case of the cubic spline is treated in greater detail. The present approach is compared with previous methods that are reexamined from a critical point of view. It is concluded that B-spline interpolation correctly applied does not result in a loss of image resolution and that this type of interpolation can be performed in a very efficient manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast B-spline transforms for continuous image representation and interpolation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.75515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/2513/00075515.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.75515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75515/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fast B-spline transforms for continuous image representation and interpolation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3920503","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast B-spline transforms for continuous image representation and interpolation","sourcePdf":"00075515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027901S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"179","articleId":"75515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75516,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The backpropagation network has no mechanism in the standard training scheme for identifying regions not in any known classes. The radial basis function network overcomes these difficulties by using a nonmonotonic transfer function based on the Gaussian density function. While producing robust decision surfaces, the radial basis function also provides an estimate of how close a test case is to the original training data, allowing the classifier to signal that a test case potentially represents a novel class while still presenting the most plausible classification. For applications where this type of behavior is important, such as fault diagnosis, the radial basis function network is shown to offer clear advantages over the backpropagation network. The radial basis function is also faster to train because the training of the two layers is decoupled.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3918164","publicationDate":"April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radial basis function networks for classifying process faults","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis function networks for classifying process faults","sourcePdf":"00075576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031723S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"2516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"235","articleId":"75576","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":75579,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The vehicle is assumed to be equipped with sensors detecting the surrounding traffic, road signs, and road geometry as well as control logic and actuators governing the throttle, steering angle, and brakes. The goal of the expert system is to issue commands to the controllers, given the traffic situation, traffic signals, road signs, and the strategy chosen by the driver. The system presented consists of a rule base providing the required driving knowledge, a backward chaining inference engine that performs the reasoning, a knowledge-base compiler that optimizes the reasoning process, and a highway-traffic simulator that simulates vehicles on a highway, either controlled by a preset strategy or by instance of the expert system. The implementation and the testing environment, including the highway traffic simulator and simulation results, is described. The benefits associated with the use of the system are summarized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.75579","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","startPage":"53","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/2516/00075579.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.75579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An expert system for automated highway driving","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Expert systems","Automated highways","Traffic control","Road vehicles","Road transportation","Automobiles","Vehicle detection","Geometry","Automatic control","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","computerised navigation","expert systems","inference mechanisms","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","computerised navigation","expert system","automated highway driving","automobile","control logic","backward chaining inference","knowledge-base compiler","reasoning","highway-traffic simulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","displayDocTitle":"An expert system for automated highway driving","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3918167","publicationDate":"April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75579/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An expert system for automated highway driving","sourcePdf":"00075579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035214S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"2516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"19","articleId":"75579","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75608,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Over the radial range 0-9 cm from the ring center, radial transverse resolution is 4.6-6.4 mm, aid tangential transverse resolution is 4.6-5.1 mm using a Hanning filter. Over the same range, axial resolution varies from 6.1-6.2 mm in direct slices and from 5.4-7.1 mm in cross slices.

The behavioral mapper maps the behavior onto a parameterized structure to produce microcode and parameter values. The silicon assembler then translates the filled-out structural description into a physical layout, and, with the aid of simulation tools, the user can fine tune the data path by iterating this process. The silicon assembler can also be used without the behavioral mapper for high-sample-rate applications.

In addition to time-constrained scheduling and resource-constrained scheduling, a scheduling problem called feasible scheduling, which provides a paradigm for exploring the solution space, is constructed. Extensive consideration is given to the following applications: scheduling with chaining, multicycle operations by nonpipelined function units, and multicycle operations by pipelined function units; functional pipelining; loop folding; mutually exclusive operations; scheduling under bus constraint; and minimizing lifetimes of variables. The complexity of the number of variables in the formulation is O(s*n) where s and n are the number of control steps and operations, respectively. Since the as soon as possible (ASAP), as late as possible (ALAP), and list scheduling techniques are used to reduce the solution space, the formulation becomes very efficient. A solution to a practical problem, such as the fifth-order filter, can be found optimally in a few seconds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.75629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/2519/00075629.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.75629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A formal approach to the scheduling problem in high level synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","displayDocTitle":"A formal approach to the scheduling problem in high level synthesis","volume":"10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3918613","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75629/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A formal approach to the scheduling problem in high level synthesis","sourcePdf":"00075629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071057S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"281","articleId":"75629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":75631,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Complete compatibility with a commercial CMOS process is achieved through design of a novel, but acceptable, layout for implementation by the CMOS foundry using its regular process sequence. Following commercial production and delivery of the CMOS chips, a single maskless etch in an aqueous ethylemediamine-pyrocatechol mixture is performed to realize the micromechanical structures. The resulting structures are suspended plates consisting of polysilicon resistors encapsulated in the field and CVD (chemical-vapor-deposited) oxides available in the CMOS process. The plates are suspended by aluminum heater leads that are also encapsulated in the field and CVD oxides.

In addition to reducing the effective thickness of the antifuse dielectric, the current conduction asymmetry of the NO layer is also utilized to lower the breakdown voltage to 10.6 V, and consequently the programming voltage to 13.5 V, which is lower than that of previously reported antifuse structures. Time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements verify that this scaled antifuse structure exhibits a lifetime exceeding ten years (>1*10/sup 12/ s) at 5.5 V in the unprogrammed state. Since a significant fraction of the total measured antifuse resistance is contributed by the sheet resistance of the polysilicon electrodes, this structure also demonstrates the reduction of this resistance component through silicidation of both top and bottom electrodes in the area outside of the antifuse. This poly-poly antifuse structure offers reduction in programmed voltage, reduction in silicon device area, simple peripheral circuitry design, and faster circuit operation due to lower capacitance than previous poly-N/sup +/ antifuse structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.75747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/2525/00075747.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.75747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaled dielectric antifuse structure for field-programmable gate array applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75747/","displayDocTitle":"Scaled dielectric antifuse structure for field-programmable gate array applications","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3911900","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaled dielectric antifuse structure for field-programmable gate array applications","sourcePdf":"00075747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032765S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"2525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"33","articleId":"75747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":75754,"authors":[{"name":"Y.K.

The diode consists of two back-to-back Schottky junctions.

The basic idea consists of using the different bias voltages to change the location and depth of the photon collection region in which photons with different wavelengths are mainly collected. The photoresponse time was measured under a red LED light injection with an intensity of 150 mu W. The typical photoresponse time for red is 60 ns under -1.5-V bias.

Based on the response of device parameters with the progress of hydrogenation, two types of defects can be distinguished from the difference in passivation rate. The threshold voltage and subthreshold slope, which are strongly influenced by the density of dangling bond midgap states, have a faster response to hydrogenation. The off-state leakage current and field-effect mobility, related to stain-bond tail states, respond more slowly to hydrogenation, with an onset period of approximately 4 to 12 h depending on the grain size.

It is pointed out that when non-Poisson behavior is encountered in defect data, it is necessary to determine whether this is due to an out-of-control manufacturing process or a manufacturing or data collection procedure that yields clustered defect counts. A procedure that includes the outlier removal method to discriminate between clustered defect data and a process that is out of control is proposed, and its application to two sets of real-world data is shown. One is an example from IC manufacturing where true clustering exists, and the other is a manufacturing example where persistent out-of-control conditions give the appearance of clustering. Simulation results indicate that the procedure works well within reasonable boundaries.

The use of this architecture to process modeling and recipe synthesis for deposition rate, stress, and film thickness in low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of undoped polysilicon is discussed. In this architecture the model for a process is generated by combining the qualitative knowledge of human experts, captured in the form of influence diagrams, and the learning abilities of neural networks for extracting the quantitative knowledge that relates the parameters of a process. To evaluate the merits of this methodology, the accuracy of these new models is compared to that of more conventional models generated by the use of first principles and/or statistical regression analysis. The models generated by the integration of influence diagrams and neural networks are shown to have half the error or less, even though given only half as much information in creating the models. Furthermore, it is shown that, by employing the generalization ability of neural networks in the synthesis algorithm, new recipes can be produced for the process. Two such recipes are generated for the LPCVD process. One is a zero-stress polysilicon film recipe; the second is a uniform deposition rate recipe which is based on the use of a nonuniform temperature distribution during deposition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75852/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3913782","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Use of influence diagrams and neural networks in modeling semiconductor manufacturing processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of influence diagrams and neural networks in modeling semiconductor manufacturing processes","sourcePdf":"00075852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032561S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"45","articleId":"75852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":75858,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

RTP systems are single wafer and typically have a bank of heating lamps which can be individually controlled. Temperature uniformity across a wafer is difficult to obtain in RTP systems. A temperature gradient exists outward from the center of the wafer due to cooling for a uniform heat flux density on the surface of the wafer from the lamps. Experiments have shown that the nonuniform temperature of a wafer in an RTP system can be counteracted by adjusting the relative power of the individual lamps, which alters the heat flux density at the wafer. The model is composed of two components. The first predicts a wafer's temperature profile given the individual lamp powers. The second determines the relative lamp power necessary to achieve uniform temperature everywhere but at the outermost edge of the wafer (cooling at the edge is always present). The model has been verified experimentally by rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition of polycrystalline silicon with a prototype LEISK RTP system. The wafer temperature profile is inferred from the poly-Si thickness. Results showed a temperature uniformity of +or-1%, an average absolute temperature variation of 5.5 degrees C, and a worst-case absolute temperature variation of 6.5 degrees C for several wafers processed at different temperatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rapid thermal processing","Lamps","Semiconductor device modeling","Cooling","Power system modeling","Heating","Temperature control","Control systems","Chemical vapor deposition","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process control","semiconductor technology","temperature control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polysilicon","model","rapid thermal processing","uniformity through lamp control","temperature uniformity","bank of heating lamps","temperature gradient","RTP system","temperature profile","rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition","polycrystalline silicon","prototype LEISK RTP system","wafer temperature profile","poly-Si thickness","temperature variation","polycrystalline Si"]}],"doi":"10.1109/66.75858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel3/66/2529/00075858.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.75858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for rapid thermal processing: achieving uniformity through lamp control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=75858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A model for rapid thermal processing: achieving uniformity through lamp control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75858/","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3913776","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for rapid thermal processing: achieving uniformity through lamp control","sourcePdf":"00075858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036598S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"67","articleId":"75858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":75859,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The semantic pattern matcher extends the pattern matching capabilities of rule-based systems through the use of terminological knowledge. The pattern classifier enables the system to compute a rule's specificity, which is useful for conflict resolution, based on the semantics of its left-hand side. The paradigm not only enhances the reasoning capabilities of rule-based systems, but also helps to reduce the cost of maintaining such systems because definitional knowledge is explicitly represented in a form that facilitates sharing and minimizes duplication of effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/69.75885","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00075885.png","startPage":"25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/2531/00075885.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.75885","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLASP: integrating term subsumption systems and production systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/75885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"CLASP: integrating term subsumption systems and production systems","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3923615","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLASP: integrating term subsumption systems and production systems","sourcePdf":"00075885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047278S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"24","articleId":"75885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":75902,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

Blanche is designed for use in structured office or factory environments rather than unstructured natural environments, and it is assumed that an offline path planner provides the vehicle with a series of collision-free maneuvers, consisting of line and arc segments, to move the vehicle to a desired position. These segments are sent to a low-level trajectory generator and closed-loop motion control. The controller assumes accurate knowledge of the vehicle's position. Blanche's position estimation system consists of a priori map of its environment and a robust matching algorithm. The matching algorithm also estimates the precision of the corresponding match/correction that is then optimally (in a maximum-likelihood sense) combined with the current odometric position to provide an improved estimate of the vehicle's position. The system does not use passive or active beacons.

The kinetic effects of homogeneous solutions are analyzed with emphasis on placing realistic limitations on how redundancy can be utilized without adversely affecting the primary goal of a desired end effector trajectory. It is shown that it is possible to identify manipulator configurations that possess the desirable characteristic of being able either to remove or to impart a homogeneous velocity while simultaneously reducing the torque requirements on the manipulator.

Redundant elements are partitioned into individual fault-containment regions (FCRs). An FCR is a collection of components that operates correctly regardless of any arbitrary logical or electrical fault outside the region. Conversely, a fault in an FCR cannot cause hardware outside the region to fail. The outputs of all channels are required to agree bit-for-bit under no-fault conditions (exact bitwise consensus).

It is shown that the model order can be reduced, compared to ARX (FIR, AR) modeling, by using Laguerre models. Furthermore, the numerical accuracy of the corresponding linear regression estimation problem is improved by a suitable choice of the Laguerre parameter. Consistency (error bounds), persistence of excitation conditions. and asymptotic statistical properties are investigated. This analysis is based on the result that the covariance matrix of the regression vector of a Laguerre model has a Toeplitz structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.76361","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2545/00076361.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.76361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"551","endPage":"562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System identification using Laguerre models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"System identification using Laguerre models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76361/","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3939465","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System identification using Laguerre models","sourcePdf":"00076361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073984S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"557","articleId":"76361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":76368,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is assumed that there is no information available about the unknown inputs, and thus no prior assumption is made about the nature of these inputs. A simple approach for designing a reduced-order unknown input observer (UIO) with pole-placement capability is proposed. By carefully examining the dynamic system involved and simple algebraic manipulations, it is possible to rewrite equations eliminating the unknown inputs from part of the system and to put them into a form where it could be partitioned into two interconnected subsystems, one of which is directly driven by known inputs only. This makes it possible to use a conventional Luenberger observer with a slight modification for the purpose of estimating the state of the system. As a result, it is also possible to state similar necessary and sufficient conditions to those of a conventional observer for the existence of a stable estimator and also arbitrary placement of the eigenvalues of the observer. The design and computational complexities involved in designing UIOs are greatly reduced in the proposed approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.76372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/2545/00076372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.76372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2545","startPage":"632","endPage":"635","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00076372.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach to the design of unknown input observers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach to the design of unknown input observers","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76372/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3939476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach to the design of unknown input observers","sourcePdf":"00076372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038173S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"206","articleId":"76372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":76374,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Chung Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jing-Chung Shen","id":"37087215671"},{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Sen Chen","id":"37087142848"},{"name":"Fan-Chu Kung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fan-Chu Kung","id":"37087218463"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"76374","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":185,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Riccati equations","Delay systems","Control systems","Uncertainty","Bismuth","Feedback control","Nonlinear equations","Linear systems","Time varying systems","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","feedback","linear systems","matrix algebra","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memoryless stabilisation","stability","uncertain dynamic delay systems","Riccati equation","linear state feedback control","matching conditions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76374","abstract":"The authors present a procedure for obtaining the memoryless linear state feedback control of uncertain dynamic delay systems.

In the first stage, the signal samples are segmented based on the assumption that the samples in each segment should be sequentially connected. In the second stage, the resultant segments are classified with no regard to their connectivities. The algorithm is computationally fast and globally optimum. The criterion function used in this algorithm is the ratio of the within-class variation over the between-class variation. An information-theoretic criterion that can be used mainly as a stopping rule in the segmentation stage is also proposed.

The method takes advantage of the fact that action potentials are blocked with less membrane hyperpolarization in larger fibers than in smaller fibers. In this nerve stimulation system, quasitrapezoidal current pulses are delivered through a tripolar cuff electrode to effect differential blocking membrane hyperpolarization. The quasitrapezoidal pulses with a square leading edge, a 350- mu s plateau, and an exponential trailing phase ensure the blockage of propagating action potentials and prevent the occurrence of anodal break excitation. The tripolar cuff electrode design restricts current flow inside the cuff and thus eliminates the undesired nerve stimulation due to a virtual cathode. Experiments were performed on 13 cats. The cuff electrode was placed on the medial gastrocnemius nerve. Both compound and single fiber action potentials were recorded from L7 ventral root filaments. The results demonstrate that larger alpha motor axons could be blocked at lower current levels than smaller alpha motor axons, and that all alpha fibers can be blocked at lower current levels than gamma fibers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.76383","startPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2546/00076383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.76383","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective activation of small motor axons by quasitrapezoidal current pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Selective activation of small motor axons by quasitrapezoidal current pulses","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3931165","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","pubMedId":"2066126","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective activation of small motor axons by quasitrapezoidal current pulses","sourcePdf":"00076383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051846S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"161","articleId":"76383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76386,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.C.

The array consists of twelve platinum electrode sites (10*50 mu m and 50 mu m interdistance) on a 45- mu m thick tip-shaped silicon substrate and a Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ insulating glass cover layer. The tip is inserted in the peroneal nerve of a rat during acute experiments to stimulate alpha motor fibers or the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Sensitivity calculations and experiments show a cubic dependence of the number of stimulated motor units on current amplitude of the stimulatory pulse (recruitment curves), starting at single motor level. Selectivity was tested by a method based on the refractory properties of neurons. At the lowest stimulus levels (for one motor unit) selectivity is maximal when two electrodes are separated by 200-250 mu m, which was also estimated on theoretical grounds. The study provides clues for future designs of two- and three-dimensional devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/2546/00076386.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.76386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.76386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity and selectivity of intraneural stimulation using a silicon electrode array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Electrodes","Platinum","Insulation","Glass","Optical fiber testing","Muscles","Recruitment","Neurons","Estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques and instruments","microelectrodes","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intraneural stimulation selectivity","intraneural stimulation sensitivity","multielectrode array","experimental paradigms","model calculations","peroneal nerve","rat","acute experiments","extensor digitorum longus muscle","stimulated motor units","recruitment curves","refractory properties","45 micron","Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/","Pt electrode"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Electric Stimulation","Electrodes","Equipment Design","Peripheral Nerves","Peroneal Nerve","Ranvier's Nodes","Rats","Recruitment, Neurophysiological","Sensitivity and Specificity","Silicon"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity and selectivity of intraneural stimulation using a silicon electrode array","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3931168","pubMedId":"2066129","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity and selectivity of intraneural stimulation using a silicon electrode array","sourcePdf":"76386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045089S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"96","articleId":"76386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":76409,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

The approach uses the arithmetic spectrum instead of the Rademacher-Walsh spectrum. It is a form of data compression that serves to reduce the volume of the response data at test time. The price which is paid for the reduction in the storage requirements is that some of the knowledge of exact fault location is lost. The derived signatures are short and easily tested using very simple test equipment. The test circuitry could be included on the chip since the overhead involved is comparatively small. The test procedure requires a high-speed counter cycling at maximum speed through selected subsets of all input combinations. Hence, the network under test is exercised at speed, and a number of dynamic errors that are not testable by means of conventional test-set approaches will be detected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/2547/00076409.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.76409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.76409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arithmetic spectrum applied to fault detection for combinational networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arithmetic","Fault detection","Testing","Circuit faults","Information theory","Decision trees","Counting circuits","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial circuits","data compression","integrated circuit testing","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","fault signatures","single-output combinational networks","arithmetic spectrum","data compression","response data","storage requirements","chip","high-speed counter","dynamic errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","displayDocTitle":"Arithmetic spectrum applied to fault detection for combinational networks","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3948742","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arithmetic spectrum applied to fault detection for combinational networks","sourcePdf":"00076409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03527S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"35","articleId":"76409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":76411,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The C/sup 0/ finite-element basis enforces continuity of both normal and tangential E at element boundaries within homogeneous regions. At dielectric interfaces, the continuity of normal D and tangential E are enforced in a strong sense. Excellent agreement between the numerical solution and the Mie series is obtained for both internal and scattered fields for homogeneous and layered spheres under plane wave illumination. Compared to an alternative finite-element method using edge elements which lack strong enforcement of normal field continuity, the present method produces higher-order approximations, especially at dielectric interfaces, with no penalties in computational effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3931141","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Importance of normal field continuity in inhomogeneous scattering calculations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Importance of normal field continuity in inhomogeneous scattering calculations","sourcePdf":"00076426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042724S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","articleId":"76426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":76432,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The problem of solving a set of differential equations is converted into that of solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations using a technique called convolution-based sample balance. Although exact in all cases for which harmonic-balance techniques are exact, this technique does not require the use of discrete Fourier transforms, and calculating the Jacobian is straightforward. For the solution of the resulting system of nonlinear equations, an efficient and yet robust algorithm has been developed.

With the proper choice of the training sequence, implementation of the proposed channel estimator requires only additions and subtractions, i.e. no multiplications of the estimator is so simple that it can be easily implemented using an ordinary microprocessor with minimal storage. The channel estimate can serve to reduce the effects of intersymbol interference either by the maximum likelihood sequence estimator using the Viterbi algorithm or by channel equalization with a direct solution to obtain the optimum equalizer taps. A new procedure for the latter case is proposed using the Levinson-Trench algorithm for fast start-up of adaptive equalizers in noisy environments.

In the proposed ARQ scheme, whenever a packet of data needs to be retransmitted that packet is not repeated entirely as in the case of conventional full retransmission ARQ strategies. Instead, symbols of that packet are repeated a few at a time, sequentially, as needed, hence making a more effective use of the channel. It is shown that partial repetitions and code combining still yields an increase of the apparent Pareto exponent of sequential decoding, as in the case of full repetition-code combining. A throughput analysis shows that the partial retransmission ARQ strategy yields a substantial throughput improvement over the full retransmission-code combining ARQ strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Automatic repeat request","Convolutional codes","Throughput","Forward error correction","Maintenance","Noise robustness","Degradation","Viterbi algorithm","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error correction codes","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","error correction codes","partial retransmission ARQ","automatic repeat request","convolutional coding","sequential decoding","code combining","Pareto exponent","throughput analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.76457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2549/00076457.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.76457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential decoding with an efficient partial retransmission ARQ strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential decoding with an efficient partial retransmission ARQ strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76457/","volume":"39","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3931364","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential decoding with an efficient partial retransmission ARQ strategy","sourcePdf":"00076457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035083S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","articleId":"76457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":76458,"authors":[{"name":"P.Y.

The optimal receiver is derived, but is found to be difficult to implement in practice because of its exponential growth in complexity as a function of sequence length. Suboptimal decision-feedback approximations are then suggested which are linear and readily implementable and can be integrated as generalized differentially coherent receivers. The exact bit error probabilities of these suboptimal receivers are obtained. Tight upper bounds on these error probabilities are also obtained which show simply how they behave as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and order of diversity. A main conclusion of this work is that optimal data detection on a fading channel should be performed using MMSE (minimum mean squared error) estimates of the quadrature amplitudes of the channel fading processes as a coherent reference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3931365","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimal detection of digital data over the nonselective Rayleigh fading channel with diversity reception","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal detection of digital data over the nonselective Rayleigh fading channel with diversity reception","sourcePdf":"00076458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042182S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"73","articleId":"76458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":76459,"authors":[{"name":"P.Y.

Because it is similar to the established technique of self-synchronizing scrambling but is also capable of guiding the scrambling process to produce a balanced encoded bit stream, the technique is called guided scrambling, (GS). The concept of GS coding is explained, and design parameters which ensure good line code characteristics are discussed. The performance of a number of guided scrambling configurations is reported in terms of maximum consecutive like-encoded bits, encoded stream disparity, decoder error extension, and power spectral density of the encoded signal. Comparison of guided scrambling with conventional line code techniques indicates a performance which approaches that of alphabetic lookup table codes with an implementation complexity similar to that of current nonalphabetic coding techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.76466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.76466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/2549/00076466.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Guided scrambling: a new line coding technique for high bit rate fiber optic transmission systems","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3931373","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided scrambling: a new line coding technique for high bit rate fiber optic transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00076466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039237S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"76","articleId":"76466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":76467,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

An exact closed formula is derived for the queue length distribution in the case where all streams have the same period, and tight upper and lower bounds are obtained on this distribution when the periods are different. Numerical results confirm that the use of a Poisson approximation (i.e. the M/D/1 queue) can lead to a significant overestimation of buffer requirements, particularly in the case of heavy loads. Buffer requirements for a mixture of different period streams can be accurately estimated from the upper bound on the queue length distribution. For given load, requirements increase with the number of long-period (i.e. low-bit rate) sources. The results are deduced from a novel characterization of the single-server constant service time queue, which should be useful in other applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3931374","displayDocTitle":"The superposition of periodic cell arrival streams in an ATM multiplexer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The superposition of periodic cell arrival streams in an ATM multiplexer","sourcePdf":"00076467.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041858S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"115","articleId":"76467","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":76470,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The methods are applicable to software and hardware implementation using parallelism or pipelining and demonstrate that there is no theoretical limit to concurrency in a discrete-time finite-state machine. The methods can arbitrarily improve the iteration bound of discrete-time FSMs with low hardware overhead. They are efficient when the state size is finite and moderate, as in controllers, encoders, source decoders, etc. When the state size is large and the recurrence is not a closed-form function of specific classes, the methods cannot be applied directly. Another limitation is the latency induced by the block methods.

Depending on whether the cost measure is based on Manhattan or Euclidean square distance, either a linear programming or a quadratic programming approach can be applied for solutions of both problems. Two general algorithms based on quadratic programming are discussed in detail. The first algorithm is based on eigenvector decomposition, applicable for designs in which all modules are movable. The eigenvector approach gradually reduces the search space and hence reaches the global optimum in an effective way. The second approach, based on solving linear equations, is very efficient in terms of memory usage and run time and gives excellent results for two-way partitioning. It is especially useful for high-complexity circuit layout that has some input/output pads fixed around the chip boundary, since it takes care of the inherent sparsity. An efficient algorithm has been developed and applied for high-complexity VLSI designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","publicationDate":"May 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3949565","volume":"38","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to partitioning and placement (VLSI layout)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to partitioning and placement (VLSI layout)","sourcePdf":"00076488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038771S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"36","articleId":"76488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76494,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

Cheung and R.J. Marks (ibid., vol.CAS-32, no.5 p.481-4, 1985) have shown that if at least one of the interpolation functions used in the generalized sampling expansion of A. Papoulis (1977) is not square-integrable, then the problem is ill-posed in the sense that the variance of the reconstruction error is unbounded when noisy samples are used. It is shown that if all the interpolation functions are square-integrable, then the generalized sampling problem is well posed, essentially a converse of the Cheung-Marks result. A useful alternative sufficient condition for well-posedness that depends only on the transfer characteristics of the channels and does not require explicit calculation of the interpolation functions is developed. Several examples illustrating the results are given; in particular, the important nonuniform sampling strategy of J.L. Yen (IRE Trans. Circuits Theory, vol.

Experiments were carried out on Pb-5Sn and Pb-63Sn alloy solders under thermal cycle conditions of -55 to 150 degrees C/cycle/h. The thermal fatigue fracture of Pb-Sn solder joints develops when cracks, initially generated from large-scale plastic deformation of the solder, gradually propagate through the joint. On the fracture surface, striations of 500 A to 1 mu m in size were observed and crack propagation rates (da/dN) are obtained for these solders. Additionally, thermal stress and strain in solder joints is studied by the finite element method (FEM) using three-dimensional and thermoelastoplastic models. The equivalent strain range (based on the Mises criterion), obtained by FEM, relates strongly to thermal fatigue life. A thermal fatigue life equation relating crack propagation to bonding size and thermal strain range is developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1991","publicationDate":"March 1991","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3931545","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal fatigue life of Pb-Sn alloy interconnections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal fatigue life of Pb-Sn alloy interconnections","sourcePdf":"00076537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040583S","chronDate":"Mar 1991","isNumber":"2551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"70","articleId":"76537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76560,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

They will also support variable bit rates within a connection. The packetized information transfer, without flow control between the user and the network, in combination with the asynchronous multiplexing principle, results in a need to control the individual cell stream during the entire duration of the calls to ensure an acceptable quality of service for all coexisting calls sharing the same network resources. This kind of control will be provided by introducing a policing or usage parameter control function. Basic design objectives and requirements for such a function are described. These requirements serve as a basis for the comparison of some of the mechanisms proposed so far, namely the leaky bucket, the jumping window, the triggered jumping window, the moving window, and the exponentially weighted moving average mechanisms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.76630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2556/00076630.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00076630.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.76630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and performance comparison of policing mechanisms for ATM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76630/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and performance comparison of policing mechanisms for ATM networks","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3929899","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and performance comparison of policing mechanisms for ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00076630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044395S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"301","articleId":"76630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":76631,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The most critical situation, i.e., an on/off bursty source, is assumed. Moreover, the delay jitter introduced by a possible multiplexing of sources inside the customer premises network is not considered. The leaky bucket can be analyzed as a G/D/1/N queue with finite waiting room N and a suitable arrival process. An alternative approach, the fluid flow approximation, in which the bit flow is considered as a continuous variable, is presented. By comparison with the exact model, it is shown that the accuracy of the fluid flow approach is sufficient for practical purposes. An explicit formula for the cell loss probability, in case of exponential distributions for both the burst duration and the inactivity period of the source, is derived. On the basis of that formula, some numerical evaluations are presented with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of the leaky bucket mechanism. It is concluded that while the leaky bucket can easily control the peak rate, difficulties arise in controlling the mean bit rate (because of the long time required) and the burst duration (because of the poor selectivity).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.76631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2556/00076631.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.76631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2556","startPage":"335","endPage":"342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of the 'leaky bucket' policing mechanism in ATM networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of the 'leaky bucket' policing mechanism in ATM networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1991","accessionNumber":"3929900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of the 'leaky bucket' policing mechanism in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00076631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02923S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"183","articleId":"76631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76632,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Such queues are analyzed by exploiting a result expressing the distribution of work in system of the G/G/1 queue originally derived by V.E. Benes (1963). A simple alternative demonstration of this result is analyzed and extended to the case of fluid input systems. The result is applied first to a queue where the arrival process is a superposition of periodic sources (the Sigma D/sub i//D/1 queue), and then to a variable-input-rate constant-output-rate fluid system. The latter is shown to model the so-called burst component of the considered superposition queuing process. The difference between this and the real queue, the cell component, can be evaluated by means of the results obtained for the Sigma D/sub i//D/1 queue. The relative importance of these two components is explored with reference to the particular case of a superposition of on/off sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Asynchronous transfer mode","Multiplexing","Queueing analysis","Intelligent networks","Helium","Digital communication","Communication switching","Frequency","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing equipment","packet switching","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATM network","superposition","variable bit rate sources","ATM multiplexer","asynchronous transfer mode","queues","G/G/1 queue","periodic sources","Sigma D/sub i//D/1 queue","variable-input-rate constant-output-rate fluid system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/49.76636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/2556/00076636.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.76636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The superposition of variable bit rate sources in an ATM multiplexer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The superposition of variable bit rate sources in an ATM multiplexer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76636/","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3929905","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The superposition of variable bit rate sources in an ATM multiplexer","sourcePdf":"00076636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050368S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"106","articleId":"76636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":76637,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Based on this model, the impact of the speedup factor on the switch performance is analyzed. In particular, the maximum switch throughput, and the average system delay for any given degree of speedup are obtained. The results demonstrate that the switch can achieve 99% throughput with a modest speedup factor of four. Packet blocking probability for systems with finite buffers can also be derived from this model, and the impact of buffer allocation on blocking probability is investigated. Given a fixed buffer budget, this analysis obtains an optimal placement of buffers among input and output ports to minimize the blocking probability. The model is also extended to cover a nonhomogeneous system, where traffic intensity at each input varies and destination distribution is not uniform. Using this model, the effect of traffic imbalance on the maximum switch throughput is studied. It is seen that input imbalance has a more adverse effect on throughput than output imbalance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3929912","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis, optimal buffer allocation, and traffic imbalance study of a generic nonblocking packet switch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis, optimal buffer allocation, and traffic imbalance study of a generic nonblocking packet switch","sourcePdf":"00076643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038466S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"61","articleId":"76643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":76647,"authors":[{"name":"C.I.

The extension is based on the same mathematical technique but includes Gaussian noise originating after the signal has been converted to an electrical current. This noise could be thermal noise, shot noise, or a combination of both. It is no longer assumed that the pulse representing a logical one fills its time slot completely. Now, the optical pulses can be much shorter than the bit period (solitons), the power level of logical zeros need not vanish, and the thermal noise of the postdetection electronic circuit is taken into account.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.76665","startPage":"505","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/2557/00076665.pdf","endPage":"513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.76665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76665/","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of bit-error probability for a lightwave system with optical amplifiers and post-detection Gaussian noise","volume":"9","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3930344","publicationDate":"April 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of bit-error probability for a lightwave system with optical amplifiers and post-detection Gaussian noise","sourcePdf":"00076665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039141S","chronDate":"Apr 1991","isNumber":"2557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"119","articleId":"76665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76684,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The procedure used to formulate hybrid port equations is general and can be used for any converter module network with nonlinear branch functions. The valve model selection has no theoretical restrictions, and the particular case of valve modeling by ideal switches is simple to accommodate. The new approach is more general and efficient than the standard EMTP method for power converter simulation.

Indeed, they tend to be isolated in the factor space and weakly coupled with the surrounding measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76693/","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3951802","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","displayDocTitle":"Least median of squares estimation in power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least median of squares estimation in power systems","sourcePdf":"00076693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051531S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"114","articleId":"76693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":76694,"authors":[{"name":"E.N.

The nose curve (PV curve), which donates the relationship between total load and system voltages, is calculated by a new approach based on the homotopy continuation method. The critical loading condition, which might be called the bifurcation point, is also calculated precisely as the final point of the nose curve. This method does not require an exhausting cut-and-try process or a rough-approximation process. It is based on the conventional Newton-Raphson load flow calculation, but it overcomes the numerical difficulties associated with the singularity of the Jacobian matrix. The results of applying the proposed method to the IEEE 118-bus system and to other large practical systems (e.g., a 496-bus system) verify its robustness and feasibility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.76701","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/2558/00076701.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.76701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"584","endPage":"593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of critical loading condition with nose curve using homotopy continuation method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=76701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of critical loading condition with nose curve using homotopy continuation method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76701/","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3951810","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of critical loading condition with nose curve using homotopy continuation method","sourcePdf":"00076701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049394S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"153","articleId":"76701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":76702,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Gibbard (see Proc. IEE, vol.135(4), pt.C, p.276-84, July 1988) for the coordinated design of power system stabilizers (PSSs) in multimachine power systems is further developed. The aim of the approach is to provide, through the action of the stabilizer, an electrical damping torque proportional to speed perturbations, i.e. Delta /sub di/(s)=D/sub i/ Delta omega /sub i/(s). The stabilizer network is designed to compensate for the torque-reference voltage transfer function Delta P/sub ei/(s)/ Delta nu /sub ri/(s). It is demonstrated that this transfer function remains more or less invariant over a wide range of operating conditions. As a result, it is shown that the design approach yields fixed-parameter PSSs which are robust over a wide range of conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3951821","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust design of fixed-parameter power system stabilisers over a wide range of operating conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust design of fixed-parameter power system stabilisers over a wide range of operating conditions","sourcePdf":"00076727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046703S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"79","articleId":"76727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":76730,"authors":[{"name":"R.N.

CRAFT (customer restoration and fault testing) is a rule-based expert system which is capable of locating the faulted section of a transmission line equipped with automatic switches and circuit breakers. In this study, the capabilities of CRAFT are extended by adding two new knowledge bases with rules to determine the status of unsupervised automatic switches and to detect the presence and location of a manual switch with an incorrect status, following a fault. An approach to appending a separate expert system computer to the SCADA system is developed. Software and hardware interfaces are designed and implemented. The completed implementation is operating online. The implementation represents a step toward practical application of expert systems for real time operation of power systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3951833","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An online operational expert system with data validation capabilities (for power systems)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An online operational expert system with data validation capabilities (for power systems)","sourcePdf":"00076739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034775S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"10","articleId":"76739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":76740,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The authors present the results of a study to assess the capability of ANNs to learn from offline stability analysis results and give stability assessments when queried with data representing the current system status. The important feature of the result is that correct stability assessments are provided by the ANN not only when it is queried with an element of the training set of data but also under other operating conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.76740","startPage":"890","endPage":"896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.76740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/2558/00076740.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary results on using artificial neural networks for security assessment (of power systems)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76740/","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary results on using artificial neural networks for security assessment (of power systems)","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3951834","publicationDate":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary results on using artificial neural networks for security assessment (of power systems)","sourcePdf":"00076740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048044S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"28","articleId":"76740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":76804,"authors":[{"name":"P.O.

The accuracy of sampled-data modeling is incorporated into the model by a second-order representation of the sampled-data transfer function which is valid up to half the switching frequency. Predictions of current loop gain; control-to-output; output impedance; and audio susceptibility transfer functions were confirmed with measurements on a buck converter. The audio susceptibility of the buck converter can be nulled with the appropriate value of external ramp. The modeling concentrates on constant-frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters, but the methods can be applied to variable-frequency control and discontinuous conduction mode.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/2560/00076813.pdf","doi":"10.1109/63.76813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.76813","startPage":"271","endPage":"280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new, continuous-time model for current-mode control (power convertors)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76813/","displayDocTitle":"A new, continuous-time model for current-mode control (power convertors)","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3940803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new, continuous-time model for current-mode control (power convertors)","sourcePdf":"00076813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078989S","chronDate":"April  1991","isNumber":"2560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"606","articleId":"76813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":76815,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that mode partitioning between the main mode and a weak side mode in conjunction with the difference in longitudinal distributions can lead to strong rebroadening even for side mode suppression ratios (SMRs) larger than 30 dB. An analytical expression for the new linewidth contribution is derived. The contribution increases with the third power of the photon number in the dominant side mode. This agrees with experiments on DFB lasers when one generally observes a strong increase in linewidth where the SMSR decreases below 30 dB. This work and the reported experimental results clearly show that linewidths increase if the side mode suppression goes down. However, it seems that in some DFB lasers rebroadening can occur without any decrease in SMSR, so that other mechanisms need to be considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.76858","startPage":"112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2563/00076858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.76858","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linewidth rebroadening in DFB lasers due to weak side modes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1991","displayDocTitle":"Linewidth rebroadening in DFB lasers due to weak side modes","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3941834","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linewidth rebroadening in DFB lasers due to weak side modes","sourcePdf":"00076858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034267S","chronDate":"Feb.  1991","isNumber":"2563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"29","articleId":"76858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":76860,"authors":[{"name":"M.

External responsivities in response to a guided signal of 0.43 and 0.5 A/W were recorded, respectively for a 150- and a 300- mu m-long detector integrated with an InGaAsP waveguide. This corresponds to an internal quantum efficiency of about 95% after taking account of the combined external losses such as insertion loss between waveguide and fiber and propagation loss in the waveguide. A pulse response of 200 ps. corresponding to a bandwidth of about 820 MHz, was measured at the output of the HEMT amplifier.

In this arrangement the network users employ pseudorandom codes to frequency modulate the optical signal on the fiber bus using an optical pulse modulator.

The formulation can be generalized to support multicycle operations, multiple operations per cycle, pipelined data paths, mutually exclusive operations, and variables' lifetime consideration in a data path.

This algorithm is generic and can be used for synthesizing both nonpipelined and pipelined data paths. The scheduling algorithm tries to distribute operations equally among partitions to maximize hardware sharing. Multiplexer delays are explicitly considered to produce a more accurate scheduling. In hardware sharing, structural parameters such as the size of multiplexers, interconnect overhead, the size of the smallest sharable operator etc. are used to control the amount of sharing globally and produce a heuristically optimized RTL structure. The scheduling algorithm is iterated until a satisfactory structure is obtained. The algorithm also can be used for partitioning a large system into implementable pieces.

The method assumes that the circuit performances ultimately determining yield can be approximated by computationally inexpensive functions of the inputs to the circuit simulator. These inputs are the designable parameters, the uncontrollable statistical variations, and the operating conditions of interest. The authors fit the approximating functions to data from a statistical experiment incurring relatively few runs of the simulator. For a given set of designable parameters, the fitted models predict the circuit performances as the uncontrollable parameters and operating conditions vary. The predictions lead to estimates of the parametric yield, which is then numerically maximized with respect to the designable parameters. The authors give a CMOS circuit example where sufficiently accurate predictions and good actual yield result from about 100 runs of the circuit simulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Nov. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/76933/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3695646","conferenceDate":"5-9 Nov. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient method for parametric yield optimization of MOS integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method for parametric yield optimization of MOS integrated circuits","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00076933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036104S","chronDate":"5-9 Nov. 1989","isNumber":"2564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"263","citationCount":"9","articleId":"76933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":76934,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

On completion, it guarantees a prime and irredundant, fully testable Moore or Mealy finite state machine. Given a two-level circuit with these properties, constrained algebraic factorization techniques are used that retain the invariant that no single fault can both produce an invalid state and corrupt the distinguishing sequence by which that invalid state is detected. Besides offering a more detailed understanding of the sources of untestability in sequential circuits than previous approaches, this approach offers significant practical advantages as well. It is applicable to a wider range of circuits than optimal synthesis procedures whose utility is often limited by prohibitively high CPU requirements, and its less restrictive synthesis constraints result in lower area overhead than other constrained synthesis approaches. These observations are supported by experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1989.76937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1989.76937","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Piecewise approximate circuit simulation, an alternative that can be more efficient and allows variable accuracy in the simulation process, is discussed. Thus, the tradeoff between accuracy and CPU time is in the hands of the user. SPECS (simulation program for electronic circuits and systems) is the prototype implementation of a piecewise approximate, tree/link based, event driven, variable accuracy circuit simulation algorithm that uses table models for device evaluation. The models can be built at various levels of accuracy, and concomitant levels of precision are reflected in the simulation results. SPECS has been benchmarked on some large, industrial circuits and has proven to be an efficient and reliable simulator. However, it suffers a penalty in run time while simulating stiff circuits, or circuits with a wide range of time constants. The authors present enhanced algorithms used in SPECS to ensure efficient steady-state computation for stiff circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1989.76946","startPage":"248","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

They present a novel test procedure that exploits both the structure of the combinational logic in the circuit as well as the sequential behavior of the circuit. In contrast to previous approaches, the authors decompose the problem of sequential test generation into three subproblems of combinational test generation, fault-free state justification, and fault-free state differentiation. They describe fast algorithms for state justification and state differentiation using the ON sets and OFF sets of flip-flop inputs and primary outputs. The decomposition of the testing problem into three subproblems rather than the traditional two, performing the justification and differentiation steps on the fault-free rather than the faulty machine, and the use of efficient techniques for cube intersection result in significant performance improvements over previous approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

They show the high promise of such a machine in handling routing on single as well as on multiple layers. The mapping corresponding to a C-wrapped hexagonal interconnection of N processing elements (PEs) results in an interprocessor cycle length of N. This is much superior to the N/2 results obtained by other researchers. Consequently, fewer conflicts arise during wave-front expansion and a good quality routing can be achieved in a much shorter period. The authors show that a hexagonal mesh with 3 kG PEs can do routing on k-layer grids with kG/sup 2/ grid points at speeds comparable to the full grid machine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1989.76987","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The simulator uses compiled code techniques with an event-driven algorithm. Each wire is compiled into a routine that performs fanout processing for that wire, and each gate is compiled into a routine that simulates that gate. At simulation time, the addresses of routines for active nodes and active gates are dynamically compiled into a threaded code sequence for simulating the active parts of the circuits. Gate-level simulation using C code output is up to 7 times faster, using as few as 40 machine instructions per gate event, while machine code would permit 20 instructions per gate event. This technique is then extended to hierarchical simulation, in which a fanout procedure and a simulation procedure are generated for each unique subcircuit type. Hierarchical simulation reduces preprocessing time by allowing incremental recompilation, in which only modified subcircuits are recompiled. The performance improvement is smaller due to the overhead of passing logic values and activation information between subcircuits, but a speed increase of 2 to 4 is realized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical compiled event-driven logic simulation","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1989.76999","endPage":"501","displayPublicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Rules 1-3 involve movement upstream, along a single branch, and past, respectively, a lumped capacitor to ground, a series lumped resistor, and a uniformly distributed RC segment.

The approach makes use of the notion of categorization. The parameters that are highly correlated with the total path delay are first identified. These parameters are combined in a single score function. This function is evaluated for each enumerated path. The k paths with the smallest scores (or largest depending on the score function) are the most critical paths. The nets covered by the selected paths are the predicted critical nets. The nets are also ranked according to their coverage frequencies, timing (load factors), and physical characteristics (number of loading pins). A description is given of the delay model used and the authors' approach to the prediction of the dangerous paths and nets.

With fault simulation and a backtrack limit of 10, the RI program is able to find a test for all testable faults and identify all the redundant faults in each of the ISCAS benchmark examples. The RR program makes the whole benchmark set 100% testable for single stuck-at faults, and generates the test, in less than 1 CPU hour (SUN4/280). The algorithms were developed for equivalence-based logic optimization applications, which accentuate the role of heuristics in the process of automatic test program generation (ATPG), since this diminishes the role of fault simulation. The authors compare a limited set of results obtained by RR to those of existing logic optimization programs. The results show that in most cases, superior results can be obtained with factors of tens to hundreds speedup in CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1989 IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

DAPPER classifies faults initially by their detection probability for coarse resolution, and secondly using their first failing pattern and a conventional signature for fine resolution.

Six material parameters (coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Poisson's ratio, and Young's modulus for the glue and molding compound) and five geometric parameters (die-pad, glue, chip, and polymide coating thicknesses and the exposed die pad length) were evaluated. All parameters were varied between realistic upper and lower limits. Twelve FEA models were designed and the calculations carried out. The effect of the various parameters on stress at points near the die edge was observed. The CTE and Young's modulus of the molding compound were found to have an overwhelming effect on stress on the die surface and the surrounding encapsulation. Chip thickness had a moderate effect. Polyimide coating thickness had a moderate effect only near the die edge. The effect of the molding compound's coefficient of thermal expansion and Young's modulus was expected. The surprising result was the small effect of the other seven parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/77842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3613220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 1969","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stress effects of package parameters on 4 Mega DRAM with fractional factorial designed finite element analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress effects of package parameters on 4 Mega DRAM with fractional factorial designed finite element analysis","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00077842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049002S","chronDate":"22-24 May 1989","isNumber":"2572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"849","citationCount":"10","articleId":"77842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":77952,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A cylindrical rotor is placed inside a hollow cylindrical hole of slightly larger diameter. Electrodes on the circumference of the hole electrostatically attract the rotor and cause it to roll inside the stator. The harmonic motion of the rotor produces a gear reduction between the electrical drive frequency and the shaft rotation rate. This motor design has the advantage of increasing the torque of the motor. This motor has several other advantages. First, it uses the clamping force, normally larger than the tangential force used by most electrostatic motor designs, to generate the motion. Second, the sliding friction between the rotor and stator, a source of hindrance for most micro electrostatic motors, helps be keeping the rotor and stator from slipping. Third, this motor uses rolling surfaces that dissipate less energy in fiction than sliding surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.1989.77952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2575","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, , Proceedings, 'An Investigation of Micro Structures, Sensors, Actuators, Machines and Robots'","pdfPath":"/iel2/866/2575/00077952.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An operational harmonic electrostatic motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/77952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Feb 1989","displayDocTitle":"An operational harmonic electrostatic motor","conferenceDate":"20-22 Feb. 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3416720","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An operational harmonic electrostatic motor","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00077952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048787S","chronDate":"20-22 Feb 1989","isNumber":"2575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"866","citationCount":"33","articleId":"77952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":77959,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

Under nonlinear model-based control the limbs can move at up to 2 m/s relative to each other. Ferroelectric polymer microgrippers have been fabricated to facilitate cell manipulation. The microrobot has a three-dimensional laser vision system with a resolution of 50 to 100 nm. Volume images containing magnitude, phase, polarization, and spectral information can be acquired. The microrobot incorporates facilities to keep single living cells alive for long periods. A macro version of the microrobot has been built to allow force-reflecting teleoperation of the microrobot.

Polysilicon plug technology takes advantage of the desirable properties of LPCVD polysilicon (i.e. conformal step coverage, smooth texture, good etchability) to planarize submicron contacts. In addition, sputtered and CVD barrier metal layers are utilized to ensure good ohmic contact and maintain a low-resistance plug. It is shown that the polysilicon plugs completely fill the contact holes and provide a nearly planar surface for the sputtered aluminum. In addition, the RIS+CVD TiN barrier is highly conformal for all observed contact sizes. The specific contact resistance to n/sup +/ and p/sup +/ doped silicon was found to be less than 5*100/sup -7/ Omega -cm/sup 2/. To titanium silicide, the contact resistance dropped to below 2*10/sup -8/ Omega -cm/sup 2/. The composite resistivity of the polysilicon plug plus CVD and RIS TiN barrier was less than 5*100/sup -4/ Omega -cm/sup 2/. Shallow junction, contact-intensive diode structures exhibited good breakdown voltages and leakage current below 5 nA/cm/sup 2/.

The effects of spatially distributed noise sources together with spatially varying carrier and photon densities and injection current are analyzed in a rigorous manner by solution of the scalar wave equation. A new rate equation for the electric field is derived, in which the longitudinal effects are represented in the form of the weight functions C/sub N/(z) and C/sub S/(z). These functions express the sensitivity of the (output) field to local changes in carrier and photon density at the position z. For Fabry-Perot laser's the z dependence of the C factors is shown to be negligible, in agreement with the fact that spatial hole burning is not considered to be important for Fabry-Perot lasers. For distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers, however, the z dependence is shown to be very significant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/2579/00078219.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.78219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.78219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=78219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of linewidth for multielectrode laser diodes with spatially distributed noise sources","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diode lasers","Semiconductor device noise","Laser tuning","Laser theory","Distributed feedback devices","Laser noise","Optical noise","Laser feedback","Pollution measurement","Fabry-Perot"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron device noise","semiconductor junction lasers","spectral line breadth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier density","distributed feedback lasers","multielectrode laser diodes","spatially distributed noise sources","general theory","linewidth","single-frequency semiconductor lasers","injection current","scalar wave equation","rate equation","electric field","longitudinal effects","weight functions","sensitivity","photon density","Fabry-Perot laser's","spatial hole burning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/78219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Theory of linewidth for multielectrode laser diodes with spatially distributed noise sources","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3949374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of linewidth for multielectrode laser diodes with spatially distributed noise sources","sourcePdf":"00078219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082961S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"123","articleId":"78219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":78233,"authors":[{"name":"K.-I.

There are three key features for the LSI: (1) a highly parallel I/O structure of triple buffer with cyclical-mode transition control methods to solve the serious problem of inter-PE data transfer overhead versus the array processing; (2) a control structure with two direct memory access (DMA) controllers to realize inter-PE data I/O processing and intra-PE processing in parallel; and (3) a pipelined recognition processing at a high execution rate realized by a pipelined structure and a balanced clock distribution design technique. These effective designs for the PE LSI allow high-speed recognition processing without any inter-PE data transfer overhead in the ring array processor. Combining the PE-LSI architecture with the proposed array architecture for highly parallel dynamic time warping (DTW) processing, a real-time continuous speech recognition system based on continuous dynamic programming matching using the SPLIT method for a 1000-word vocabulary, can be constructed using a ring array processor consisting of 30 PEs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.78272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/2581/00078272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.78272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2581","startPage":"833","endPage":"843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modularized processor LSI with a highly parallel structure for continuous speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=78272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modularized processor LSI with a highly parallel structure for continuous speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/78272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3960399","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modularized processor LSI with a highly parallel structure for continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00078272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055036S","chronDate":"Jun 1991","isNumber":"2581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","articleId":"78272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":78283,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

The algorithm presented works in the omega -k/sub x/ domain. Because time delays can be easily accommodated with phase shifts that increase linearly with omega , range migration poses no problem. The algorithm is described in plane geometry first, where range migration and phase history can be exactly matched. The effects of the sphericity of the Earth, of the Earth's rotation, and of the satellite trajectory curvature are taken into account, showing that the theoretically achievable spatial resolution is well within the requirements of present day and near future SAR missions. Terrestrial swaths as wide as 100 km can be focused simultaneously with no serious degradation. The algorithm has been tested with synthetic data, with Seasat-A data, and with airplane data (NASA-AIR).

The effective sensing area of (4.8(H)*3.6(V)) mm/sup 2/ is adopted for the 1/3-in format. This sensor realizes 330 TV lines of color horizontal resolution. In addition, a new on-chip color filter is used, and a minimum object illuminance of 3 1x has been achieved. The electronic shutter was realized by developing the vertical-extraction method, with a wide range of shutter speed from 1/60 to 1/10000 s. Moreover, the use of an embedded photodiode makes it possible to achieve a low dark current. This feature, together with the 5-V drive, gives the sensor additional high performance, including low smear (0.01%).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2585/00078363.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.78363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.78363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=78363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1/3-in 270000 pixel CCD image sensor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Charge-coupled image sensors","Optical imaging","Photodiodes","Video equipment","Optical sensors","Charge coupled devices","Energy consumption","Clocks","Optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensor","interline transfer","sensing area","1/3-in format","on-chip color filter","minimum object illuminance","electronic shutter","vertical-extraction method","shutter speed","embedded photodiode","low dark current","5-V drive","low smear","0.333 in","270000 pixel","5 V","4.8 mm","3.6 mm","16.666 ms to 100 mus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/78363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"A 1/3-in 270000 pixel CCD image sensor","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948600","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1/3-in 270000 pixel CCD image sensor","sourcePdf":"00078363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038642S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"78363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":78364,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In order to decrease the smear level, achieve uniform charge handling capability for the vertical CCD, and eliminate defects that appear as vertical stripes in the image of the device, aluminum wire was put onto the vertical transfer gate to decrease the resistance in the transfer gate and a dual-channel two-phase CCD was utilized for the horizontal shift register operated by a 37.125-MHz clock. As a result, this image sensor has a dynamic range of 72 dB and a sensitivity of 75 nA/lx for light with a color temperature of 2856 K.

The new photosite employs a buried-channel MOS transistor with a specially designed storage well located under the transistor channel in the silicon bulk. The photogenerated carriers accumulate in this well and modulate the transistor threshold. The resulting bulk charge modulated device (BCMD) has a high-sensitivity low-noise high-blooming overload capability, no detectable smear, and no image lag. The BMCD photocell has been integrated into an image-sensing array that has an 8-mm diagonal, 499 lines, and 687 pixels in each line. The individual cells are shaped into closely packed hexagons and are offset by a half pixel width between the neighbouring lines. The half pixel offset together with the dual-time readout capability gives the new sensor its superior resolution in color-sensing applications. The high light sensitivity throughout the entire visible spectrum is achieved by using a very thin polysilicon gate. The peripheral circuits needed for the array addressing and sensing functions are integrated on-chip using CMOS technology and require only the TTL driving pulses. The author further describes the basic steps of the sensor fabrication process and the results of testing and evaluation of completed units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/78373/","volume":"38","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3948610","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"BCMD-An improved photosite structure for high-density image sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BCMD-An improved photosite structure for high-density image sensors","sourcePdf":"00078373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043383S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","articleId":"78373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":78377,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The RJG detector incorporates a JFET which has an electrically floating ring-junction gate (RJG). The operating principle of the amplifier is that signal charges, transferred from the CCD into the RJG, directly modulate the drain current in the detection JFET. The performance of the detector was evaluated by operating test devices under a 37-MHz clock frequency, which is the same frequency as that for the horizontal CCD operation in the recently developed 2-million-pixel high-definition CCD image sensor. It was found that 1/f noise was reduced by introducing the JFET and that reset noise was completely eliminated by achieving complete charge transfer through the reset operation.

High-resolution reading is achieved by the new contact-type linear image sensors with a storage time of 2 ms/line.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00078383.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/2585/00078383.pdf","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.78383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.78383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=78383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"400 dpi integrated contact type linear image sensors with poly-Si TFT's analog readout circuits and dynamic shift registers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Circuits","Thin film transistors","Photodiodes","Impedance","Image storage","Glass","Frequency","Linearity","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","MOS integrated circuits","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polysilicon TFTs","linear image sensors","analog readout circuits","dynamic shift registers","glass","contact-type image sensor","TFT analog buffer amplifiers","scanning circuits","frequency range","TFT analog impedance converters","linearity","200 to 1000 kHz","2 ms","amorphous Si photodiodes","BSG","B2O3-SiO2"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/78383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"400 dpi integrated contact type linear image sensors with poly-Si TFT's analog readout circuits and dynamic shift registers","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948620","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"400 dpi integrated contact type linear image sensors with poly-Si TFT's analog readout circuits and dynamic shift registers","sourcePdf":"00078383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048966S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"78383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":78388,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

Reasonable agreement of the model with experimental data taken from the buried-channel CCDs of a PtSi Schottky barrier infrared image sensor is found. Moreover, the value for the capture cross section of electrons to the shallow phosphorus level in silicon inferred from the model follows the cascade theory for capture by M.

A novel approach to noise optimization is shown, and criteria for choosing the optimum gate dimensions are established both in theory and practice. A new parameter, the noise electron density (in square electrons per hertz), is found to be a more suitable parameter for characterizing noise performance. It is shown that, in a well-designed CCD on-chip amplifier, the noise electron density is solely the product of the equivalent gate noise of the detection-node MOS transistor and the total capacitance C/sub 1/ of the detection node. The noise performance is very insensitive to change in the channel width of a factor of two of the optimum value, but it is sensitive to a change in channel length and bias current.

This is done through the definition of an object function that vanishes at its minimum when the externally measured electric field matches the electric field given by an assumed configuration that is optimized to match measurements. The method is demonstrated by identifying the shape, permittivity, charge, and location of an electrostatic source through exterior measurement. The procedure is then extended to eddy current problems for the identification of the location and shape of cracks in metallic structures. An example demonstrates that when dealing with eddy current problems the least squares object function used by others has multiple local minima so that gradient methods have to be combined with search methods to identify the one absolute minimum. Procedures are also given for handling situations with no cracks and overdescribed cracks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2588","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/2588/00079086.pdf","doi":"10.1109/20.79086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.79086","startPage":"3433","endPage":"3443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse problem methodology and finite elements in the identification of cracks, sources, materials, and their geometry in inaccessible locations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79086/","displayDocTitle":"Inverse problem methodology and finite elements in the identification of cracks, sources, materials, and their geometry in inaccessible locations","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3960534","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse problem methodology and finite elements in the identification of cracks, sources, materials, and their geometry in inaccessible locations","sourcePdf":"00079086.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026377S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"84","articleId":"79086","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":79107,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The first approach relies primarily on digital equalization to enhance conventional sample matrix inversion (SMI) performance, whereas the second utilizes feedback to extend the SMI method into the realm of analog adaptive cancellation. An experimental four-channel receiver that supports open-loop and closed-loop operation is described. As implemented, three different canceler modes are possible: feedforward, feedback, and a tandem feedback/feedforward combination. All three modes have been successfully demonstrated in bench experiments with a broadband noise source using the SMI algorithm.

The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of this approach is critical because the strongly attenuated received fields are measured on the same array which is being used to emit a high-level illuminating signal. Therefore, carefully designed high-frequency architectures and detection techniques are necessary. The system requires no mechanical movements to illuminate the body from multiple directions (views) and measure the scattered fields. In this way, a complete data set consisting of 64 views is acquired in 3 s using low-power illumination.

This solution is achieved by the moment method, and a pseudoinversion transformation is used to face ill-conditioning problems. All experimental setup is described that uses a scanning subsystem for measuring the values of the scattered electric field inside an observation domain located outside the investigation one (i.e., the area containing the cross sections of cylindrical dielectric scatters). Rotations of the investigation domain with respect to the scanning subsystem and the transmitting antenna allow a multiview imaging process. The imaging system does not require plane-wave illumination and does not use any first-order approximations; hence, it may be used even in the case of strong scatterers. The offline and once-and-for-all computation of the pseudoinverse matrix allows an inexpensive reconstruction in terms of computer resources.

A Reed-Solomon generator matrix that possesses a certain inherent structure in GF(2) is derived. This structure allows the code to be represented as a union of cosets, each coset being an interleaver of several binary BCH codes. Such partition into cosets provides a clue for efficient bit-level soft-decision decoding. Two decoding algorithms are derived. In the development of the first algorithm a memoryless channel is assumed, making the value of this algorithm more conceptual than practical. The second algorithm, which is obtained as a modification of the first, does account for channel memory and thus accommodates a bursty channel.

Simple reasoning about the extent of each geometric entity significantly reduces the time required by such algorithms. If the ray and the geometric entities are boxed, one first tests to see whether the box around the ray and the box around a geometric entity overlap. Only if the boxes overlap does one continue to test to determine whether the ray and the entity overlap. A way to add boxes, called the S-bounds method, is described, and work to data on extending it is summarized.

It is suggested that synchronous detection or demodulation can be used in MRI systems in place of magnitude detection to provide complete suppression of undesired quadrature components, to preserve polarity and phase information, and to eliminate the biases and reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in low SNR images. The incidental phase variations in an image are removed through the use of a homodyne demodulation reference, which is derived from the image or the object itself. Synchronous homodyne detection has been applied to the detection of low SNR images, the reconstruction of partial k-space images, the simultaneous detection of water and lipid signals in quadrature, and the preservation of polarity in inversion-recovery images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/2600/00079473.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.79473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.79473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2600","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=79473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homodyne detection in magnetic resonance imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Phase detection","Envelope detectors","Signal detection","Noise reduction","Noise level","Degradation","Demodulation","Image reconstruction","Lipidomics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["homodyne detection","medical diagnostic imaging","water signals","magnetic resonance imaging","incidental phase variations","synchronous detection","demodulation","quadrature components","polarity","phase","partial k-space images","lipid signals","inversion-recovery images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1991","displayDocTitle":"Homodyne detection in magnetic resonance imaging","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1991","accessionNumber":"3947084","pubMedId":"18222812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Homodyne detection in magnetic resonance imaging","sourcePdf":"00079473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089792S","chronDate":"June  1991","isNumber":"2600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"414","articleId":"79473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":79493,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

The model is based on physical device parameters and can be used to estimate both the pull-up and the pull-down times for a variety of circuit configurations. The intrinsic delay associated with the bipolar transistors is taken into consideration by using a charge control model that incorporates the high-injection effects upon the current gain and the base transport factor. Separate sets of delay equations are derived for the pull-up and pull-down transient responses to account for significant differences between the two cases. The comparison with SPICE circuit simulation results shows that the new model predicts the respective delay times with less than 10% error in most cases. The influence of device dimensions upon the driver delay time is also investigated.

These models accurately represent the behavior of a specific piece of equipment under a wide range of etch recipes, thus making them ideal for manufacturing and diagnostic purposes. The response characteristics of a CCl/sub 4/-based plasma process used to etch doped polysilicon were examined via a 2/sup 6-1/ fractional factorial experiment followed by a Box-Wilson design. The effects of variation in RF power, pressure, electrode spacing, CCl/sub 4/ flow, He flow and O/sub 2/ flow on several output variables, including etch rate, selectivity, and process uniformity, were investigated. Etch anisotropy was also measured by scanning electron microscopy analysis on a 2/sup 6-2/ fraction of the original experiment. The screening factorial experiment was designed to isolate the most significant input parameters. Using this information as a platform from which to proceed, the subsequent phase of the experiment allowed the development of empirical models of etch behavior using response surface methodology (G. E. P. Box and N. D. Draper, 1987). The models were subsequently used to optimize the etch process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel4/66/2611/00079720.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","doi":"10.1109/66.79720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.79720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=79720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical experimental design in plasma etch modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design for experiments","Plasma applications","Etching","Plasma materials processing","Plasma properties","Plasma diagnostics","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Virtual manufacturing","Radio frequency","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor technology","silicon","sputter etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical experimental design","etch uniformity","etch selectivity","etch anisotropy","tetrachloromethane","plasma etch modeling","set of empirical models","plasma etch rates","specific piece of equipment","wide range of etch recipes","diagnostic","fractional factorial experiment","Box-Wilson design","RF power","electrode spacing","etch rate","process uniformity","scanning electron microscopy","screening factorial experiment","significant input parameters","empirical models of etch behavior","response surface methodology","He flow","O/sub 2/ flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Statistical experimental design in plasma etch modeling","volume":"4","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3952788","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical experimental design in plasma etch modeling","sourcePdf":"00079720.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045257S","chronDate":"May 1991","isNumber":"2611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"94","articleId":"79720","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":79725,"authors":[{"name":"E.

With a 500- mu J pump source, typical output energies of 200 mu J were produced. The values obtained for the lifetime go well beyond the photostability behavior reported in prior studies.

The ratio of the damping rate to the square of the resonance frequency is k=2.4 ns. This intrinsically limits the 3-dB modulation bandwidths of these lasers to about 4 GHz, negating the predicted increase in modulation bandwidth due to the large differential gain often associated with quantum-well devices. The damping behavior of these lasers is inconsistent with previous predictions of damping in bulk lasers due to spectral hole burning.

Operating in this mode, EDFAs are attractive for application as power amplifiers to ease power budget restrictions in point-to-point digital links, video distribution networks, and LANs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3953090","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-power erbium-doped-fiber amplifiers operating in the saturated regime","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-power erbium-doped-fiber amplifiers operating in the saturated regime","sourcePdf":"00079772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054971S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"47","articleId":"79772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":79773,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

It was found that when the amplifier undergoes a 6-dB gain compression due to saturation by a strong adjacent signal, the power penalty at 10/sup 9/ bit-error-rate (BER) is less than 1.5 dB. This power penalty increases rapidly when saturation is greater than 6 dB. Such a penalty increase with EDFA gain saturation is explained by the observed changes in the spontaneous emission noise factor and in the relative contribution of the circuit noise and is closely predicted by the theoretical analysis. These results demonstrate the possibility of using a saturated EDFA preamplifier while accommodating as many as several hundred optical channels or potential network users without incurring significant BER degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.79773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/2613/00079773.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"261","doi":"10.1109/68.79773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of gain saturation on receiver sensitivity in 1 Gb/s multichannel FSK direct-detection systems using erbium-doped fiber preamplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1991","displayDocTitle":"Effect of gain saturation on receiver sensitivity in 1 Gb/s multichannel FSK direct-detection systems using erbium-doped fiber preamplifiers","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1991","accessionNumber":"3953092","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1991","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of gain saturation on receiver sensitivity in 1 Gb/s multichannel FSK direct-detection systems using erbium-doped fiber preamplifiers","sourcePdf":"00079773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033182S","chronDate":"March  1991","isNumber":"2613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","articleId":"79773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":79774,"authors":[{"name":"R.

With this differential encoding scheme, only a simple delay-and-multiply demodulator is necessary, considerably reducing the signal processing complexity. The demodulators reproduce the data in a parallel fashion so no baseband demultiplexing or four-level decision circuit is required. This approach also avoids the complications of implementing a carrier recovery circuit (CRC) and a phase-locked loop associated with coherent microwave demodulation schemes. In addition to bandwidth efficiency and simplicity, differential QPSK also provides very good receiver sensitivity.

A single DHBT exhibited a current gain as high as 500 with an ideality factor of 1.4. A Darlington transistor pair showed a combined current gain of 4000. The power density of the LED was about 300 W/cm/sup 2/. The integrated structure, however, showed SCR (silicon controlled rectifier) characteristics, which was attributed to the coupling of a parasitic p-n-p transistor to the n-p-n DHBT. This problem was eliminated by first etching a groove in the semi-insulating substrate between the LED and the Darlington transistor pair and then employing metallization to provide proper connection. However, overall gains for the Darlington transistor pair were low, probably due to the leakage currents caused by surface contamination and the Zn diffusion process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CORNEL.1989.79852","startPage":"344","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CORNEL.1989.79852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2615","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits,","pdfPath":"/iel4/856/2615/00079852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of high-gain double heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistors with a LED for optical neural network application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79852/","displayDocTitle":"Integration of high-gain double heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistors with a LED for optical neural network application","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3614723","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-9 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Aug 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of high-gain double heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistors with a LED for optical neural network application","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00079852.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059547S","chronDate":"7-9 Aug 1989","isNumber":"2615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"856","citationCount":"1","articleId":"79852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":79887,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

A complete overview of the design, dynamic modeling, and control of a robot manipulator such as the one presented by the authors should be of benefit for undergraduate students, because many do not have a formal course on robotics in their curriculum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/13.79887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/13.79887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel1/13/2616/00079887.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of the dynamics of an industrial robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1991","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1991","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of the dynamics of an industrial robot","volume":"34","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1991","accessionNumber":"3939485","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of the dynamics of an industrial robot","sourcePdf":"00079887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051844S","chronDate":"Feb 1991","isNumber":"2616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"9","articleId":"79887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":79893,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

The IBM PC based system described here, which consists of an adapter card for the PC, a standard black-and-white video camera and monitor, and a collection of image processing algorithms, eliminates this problem.

The capacity of the single-user and two-user RMS-bandlimited channels are found in easy-to-compute parametric forms and are compared to the classical formulas for the capacity of strictly bandlimited channels. In addition, channels are considered where the inputs are further constrained to be pulse-amplitude-modulated waveforms. The capacity of the single-user RMS-bandlimited PAM channel is shown to coincide with Shannon's capacity formula for the strictly bandlimited channel. This shows that the laxer bandwidth constraints precisely offsets the PAM structural constraint and illustrates a tradeoff between the time-domain and frequency-domain constraints. In the synchronous two-user channel, the pair of pulses that achieves the boundary of the capacity region is derived, and it is shown that the shapes of the optimal pulses depend not only on the bandwidth but also on the respective signal-to-noise ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.79901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2617/00079901.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.79901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of root-mean-square bandlimited Gaussian multiuser channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=79901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79901/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of root-mean-square bandlimited Gaussian multiuser channels","volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948649","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of root-mean-square bandlimited Gaussian multiuser channels","sourcePdf":"00079901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064064S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","articleId":"79901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":79902,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

(2) For any set-theoretic identity, is there a corresponding information-theoretic identity and, if so, in what sense? The author establishes the analogy between information theory and set theory. Therefore, each information-theoretic operation can formally be viewed as a set-theoretic operation and vice versa. This point of view, which the author believes is of fundamental importance has apparently been overlooked in the past by information theorists. As a consequence the I-diagram, which is a geometrical representation of the relationship among the information measures, is introduced. The I-diagram is analogous to the Venn diagram in set theory.

It does not, however, make the quantization error white. In the case of multistage sigma-delta modulation with the appropriate dithering, the quantization error becomes white, even for a system with only two stages.

Let m denote the number of interfering spread-spectrum signals and let n denote the signature sequence length. Then the large deviations limit is as n to infinity with m fixed. A tight asymptotic expression for the bit-error probability is proven, and in addition, recent large-deviations results with the importance sampling Monte Carlo estimation technique are applied to obtain accurate and computationally efficient estimates of the bit-error probability for finite values of m and n. The large-deviations point of view is compared also to the conventional asymptotics of central limit theory and the associated Gaussian approximation. The Gaussian approximation is accurate and the ratio m/n is moderately large and all signals have roughly equal power. In the near/far situation, however, the Gaussian approximation is quite poor. In contrast, large-deviations techniques are more accurate in the near/far situation, and it is here that these methods provide some important practical insight.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.79907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2617/00079907.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.79907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access communications with random signature sequences: a large deviations analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=79907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79907/","displayDocTitle":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access communications with random signature sequences: a large deviations analysis","volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948651","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access communications with random signature sequences: a large deviations analysis","sourcePdf":"00079907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033602S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","articleId":"79907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":79909,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The stability region is defined to be the set of vectors of arrival rates lambda =( lambda /sub 1/,. . ., lambda /sub M/) for which there exists a vector of transmission probabilities such that the system is stable. It is assumed that arrivals are independent from slot to slot, and the following model for the arrival distribution in a slot is assumed: the total number of arrivals in any slots is geometrically distributed, with the probability that such an arrival is at node i being lambda /sub i/ times ( Sigma /sub k/ lambda /sub k/)/sup -1/, independent of the others. With this arrival model, it is proven that the closure of the stability region of the protocol is the same as the closure of the Shannon capacity region of the collision channel without feedback, as determined by J.L. Massey and P. Mathys (1985). At present it is not clear if this result depends on the choice of arrival distribution. The basic probabilistic observation is that the stationary distribution and certain conditional distributions derived from it have positive correlations for bounded increasing functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.79909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2617/00079909.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.79909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The stability region of the finite-user slotted ALOHA protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","displayDocTitle":"The stability region of the finite-user slotted ALOHA protocol","volume":"37","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The stability region of the finite-user slotted ALOHA protocol","sourcePdf":"00079909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081221S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"90","articleId":"79909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":79912,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A complete distribution of correlation values is provided. As a special case of this construction, a previous construction due to Sidelnikov (1971) is obtained. The family of sequences is asymptotically optimum with respect to its correlation properties, and, in comparison with many previous nonbinary designs, the present design has the additional advantage of not requiring an alphabet of size larger than three. The new sequences are suitable for achieving code-division multiple access and are easily implemented using shift registers. They wee discovered through an application of Deligne's bound (1974) on exponential sums of the Weil type in, several variables. The sequences are also shown to have strong identification with certain bent functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.79916","doi":"10.1109/18.79916","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2617/00079916.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00079916.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prime-phase sequences with periodic correlation properties better than binary sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prime-phase sequences with periodic correlation properties better than binary sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prime-phase sequences with periodic correlation properties better than binary sequences","sourcePdf":"00079916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030368S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"132","articleId":"79916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":79917,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Among all known constructions of cyclic difference sets it is shown that only sequences constructed from Hadamard difference sets can have an asymptotic nonzero merit factor. Maximal-length shift register sequences, Legendre, and twin-prime sequences are all constructed from Hadamard difference sets. The authors prove that the asymptotic merit factor of any maximal-length shift register sequence is three. For twin-prime sequences it is shown that the best asymptotic merit factor is six. This value is obtained by shifting the twin-prime sequence one quarter of its length. It turns out that Legendre sequences and twin-prime sequences have similar behavior. Jacobi sequences are investigated on the basis of the Jacobi symbol. The best asymptotic merit factor is shown to be six. Through the introduction of product sequences, it is argued that the maximal merit factor among all sequences of length N is at least six when N is large. The authors also demonstrate that it is fairly easy to construct sequences of moderate composite length with a merit factor close to six.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.79917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/2617/00079917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.79917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=2617","startPage":"617","endPage":"626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The merit factor of binary sequences related to difference sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=79917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The merit factor of binary sequences related to difference sets","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1991","accessionNumber":"3948659","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The merit factor of binary sequences related to difference sets","sourcePdf":"00079917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043783S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"55","articleId":"79917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":79919,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The codes are intended for use on channels where the input alphabet size is limited. These channels arise in the context of digital data recording and certain data transmission applications. The codes-called matched-spectral-null codes-satisfy the property that the frequencies at which the code power spectral density vanishes correspond precisely to the frequencies at which the channel transfer function is zero. It is shown that matched-spectral-null sequences provide a distance gain on the order of 3 dB and higher for a broad class of partial-response channels. The embodiment of the system incorporates a sliding-block code and a Viterbi detector based upon a reduced-complexity trellis structure. The detectors are shown to achieve the same asymptotic average performance as maximum-likelihood sequence detectors, and the sliding-block codes exclude quasi-catastrophic trellis sequences in order to reduce the required path memory length and improve worst-case detector performance.

The authors investigate bounds on the capacity of this channel where the channel inputs are the (d,k) codes commonly used in magnetic recordings. For d>or=2, this channel is conveniently described in terms of phrase lengths where a bit shift causes a phrase either to shrink or to expand. The inherent correlation present in consecutive shift-affected phrases introduces memory into the channel model. Sequences of nondecreasing lower bounds and nonincreasing upper bounds on the capacity are evaluated and investigated for a variety of parameters. Lower bounds on the zero-error capacity are also studied. The channel model is extended to a concatenated scheme of a bit shift channel connected in tandem with the binary symmetric channel, thus capturing both major error generating mechanisms-the bit shifts as well as randomly generated errors.

It is shown that such codes have the capability of correcting combinations of bidirectional and unidirectional byte errors and code constructions. These are derived from the combination of two codes. One is a code for encoding the Hamming weights of data bytes and is used to estimate error locations. The other is a byte-error-correcting code for error evaluation. Moreover, the authors describe a decoding procedure for the codes, correcting combinations of bidirectional and unidirectional byte errors. The constructions provide many efficient codes of short length. For example, when a byte consists of 32 bits, a systematic code can be constructed with 61 information bytes and 3 check bytes that has the capability of correcting a single bidirectional byte error for double unidirectional byte errors, whereas the best known double-byte-error-correcting code requires 4 check bytes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/79959/","volume":"37","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3970949","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple undirectional byte error-correcting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple undirectional byte error-correcting codes","sourcePdf":"00079959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02354S","chronDate":"May  1991","isNumber":"2617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"79959","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":79960,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.
