In order to take advantage of this character, we have proposed three mechanisms, which require user orientation, content detector or content-based authentication methods.

Due to the limited retransmission cannot ensure the high reliability of the wireless link, the CS data gathering algorithm based on retransmission and temporal sequence correlation prediction (CS-RTSC) is proposed in this paper. When packets loss occur in the process of data gathering, the limited retransmissions is the primary choice to recover the packets. If the recovery is not successful, the temporal sequence correlation prediction is adopted. Simulation results show that CS-RTSC algorithm can guarantee the normal implementation of the CS data gathering under the unreliable links compared to existing CS data gathering algorithm and the relative error of the data reconstruction under 30% packet loss ratio is only 0.1% higher than that under the ideal links.","doi":"10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210492","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168205/8210453/08210492.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8210453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data gathering algorithm based on compressive sensing in lossy wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8210492/","displayDocTitle":"A Data gathering algorithm based on compressive sensing in lossy wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17448166","htmlLink":"/document/8210492/","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data gathering algorithm based on compressive sensing in lossy wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"Bb033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07908S","chronDate":"14-16 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168205","isNumber":"8210453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168205","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8210453","articleId":"8210492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8210518,"authors":[{"name":"Fangfang Shen","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fangfang","lastName":"Shen","id":"38236992400"},{"name":"Yanming Liu","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yanming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086154972"},{"name":"Xiaoping Li","affiliation":["School of Aerospace Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoping","lastName":"Li","id":"37086116727"},{"name":"Guanghui Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402341800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4860-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4858-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4861-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8210518","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"abstract":"Conventional beamforming technique suffers from the Rayleigh resolution limit and can't obtain high resolution DOA estimation.

Previously, the probable mismatch between the dataset and the training parameters determined by trial and error or grid search may hinder the exploration of the best result. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate the most suitable training parameters, based on the inbreeding prevention of genetic algorithm (GA) by assigning the training model parameters of SVM as its chromosome. Treating the k-fold cross validation of SVM training as the objective function, our new method makes the population on the whole evolve towards the values that are more appropriate for the dataset. The inbreeding prevention mechanism (IPM) can protect the population from converging over-rapidly before reaching the optimum value. Compared with the standard SVM, the proposed method has greatly improved the prediction accuracy in both training data and testing data.","doi":"10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210537","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168205/8210453/08210537.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8210453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Support Vector Machine-Based Genetic AlgorithmMethod for Gas Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8210537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Support Vector Machine-Based Genetic AlgorithmMethod for Gas Classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17432931","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8210537/","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Support Vector Machine-Based Genetic AlgorithmMethod for Gas Classification","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"Bb078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069344S","chronDate":"14-16 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168205","isNumber":"8210453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168205","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8210453","articleId":"8210537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8210559,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Technology, Hainan College of Economics and Business, Haikou, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086283534"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Jiangxi College of Applied Technology, School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Ganzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086277125"},{"name":"Shun Gen Xiao","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China","Jiangxi College of Applied Technology, School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Ganzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shun Gen","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086279737"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4860-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-4858-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4861-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8210559","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210559","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gears","Noise reduction","Fault diagnosis","Neural networks","Singular value decomposition","Wavelet packets","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cracks","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fault diagnosis","gears","radial basis function networks","signal denoising","singular value decomposition","vibrational signal processing","wavelet transforms","wear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular value decomposition","denoising signals","energy eigenvalues","RBF neural network training","weak gear fault signal","gear fault diagnosis method","failure signals","crack signal","wear signal","normal signal","broken tooth signal","three-layer wavelet packet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["singular value decomposition","RBF neural network","gears fault diagnosis","wavelet packet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210559","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168205/8210453/08210559.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Frontiers of Sensors Technologies (ICFST)","startPage":"470","endPage":"474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8210453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis of gear based on singular value decomposition and RBF neural network","abstract":"Aiming at the problem that the weak gear fault signal is difficult to detect, a gear fault diagnosis method based on singular value decomposition and RBF neural network is proposed.

It results in a doubly selective or a time-varying multipath channel that is arduous to estimate. Compressed Sensing (CS) schemes like the Rake Matching Pursuit (RMP) algorithm exploit the inherent sparsity in these channels and are often able to resolve the multipath environments into their respective sparse representations, even under the presence of large Doppler shifts. However, the complexity involved is substantial and might imperil practical implementation on resource limited consumer device hardware. We propose a novel low-complexity CS scheme, called as Gradient Rake MP (GRMP) that optimizes the search related to the multipath delays resulting in a complexity that is significantly lower than all CS based channel estimation schemes. Additionally, the results confirm that the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of GRMP is comparable to that of the more complex RMP algorithm. The dictionary is an imperative requirement of CS schemes and plays a decisive role in the quality of the channel estimate. Often in literature, details regarding the generation of the dictionary and its complexity is ignored and instead a suitable dictionary is assumed to be available at the receiver. This paper investigates the complexity and memory demands associated with the dictionary and presents a novel scheme to build it using the concept of wavelets. The ideas proposed in this paper are targeted towards reducing the complexity associated with the estimation of a doubly selective channel with a goal to enable implementation on consumer hardware. Although implemented for the IEEE 802.11p standard, the proposed ideas are applicable to any Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless system that is expected to work in highly mobile environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2017.8210625","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169615/8210564/08210625.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2017.8210625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8210564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity reduction for consumer device compressed sensing channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8210625/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity reduction for consumer device compressed sensing channel estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448397","htmlLink":"/document/8210625/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity reduction for consumer device compressed sensing channel estimation","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p189chelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06712S","chronDate":"3-6 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169615","isNumber":"8210564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169615","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8210564","articleId":"8210625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8210784,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Dalian University, Dalian, P.

Health data security becomes a critically important issue. Electrocardiogram (ECG) has proven to be a potential biometric in human recognition over the past decade. Unlike conventional authentication methods using passwords, fingerprints, face, etc., ECG signal can not be simply intercepted, duplicated, and enables continuous identification. However, in many of the studies, algorithms developed are not suitable for practical application, which usually require long ECG data for authentication. In this work, we introduce a two-phase authentication using artificial neural network (NN) models. This algorithm enables fast authentication within only 3 seconds, meanwhile achieves reasonable performance in recognition. We test the proposed method in a controlled laboratory experiment with 50 subjects. Finger ECG signals are collected using a mobile device at different times and physical statues. At the first stage, a \u201cGeneral\u201d NN model is constructed based on data from the cohort and used for preliminary screening, while at the second stage \u201cPersonal\u201d NN models constructed from single individual's data are applied as fine-grained identification. The algorithm is tested on the whole data set, and on different sizes of subsets (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40). Results proved that the proposed method is feasible and reliable for individual authentication, having obtained average False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) below 10% for the whole data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8210804/","accessionNumber":"17433305","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8210804/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Finger ECG-based authentication for healthcare data security using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finger ECG-based authentication for healthcare data security using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"p187chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081169S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169616","isNumber":"8210752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169616","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8210752","articleId":"8210804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8210805,"authors":[{"name":"Lixu Shao","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Lixu","lastName":"Shao","id":"37086035629"},{"name":"Yucong Duan","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Yucong","lastName":"Duan","id":"37409266600"},{"name":"Donghai Zhu","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Donghai","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086304648"},{"name":"Jinbing Li","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Jinbing","lastName":"Li","id":"37086303423"},{"name":"Hui Zhou","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37074199200"},{"name":"Qi Qi","affiliation":["Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan University"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086296266"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6704-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6703-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6705-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8210805","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Health service provision based on typed resources of data, information and knowledge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210805","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patents","Computer architecture","Writing","Semantics","Software","Inspection","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","health care","medical information systems","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health service provision","software system","web service based systems","typed health resources","Data Graph","Information Graph","Knowledge Graph","data resources","information resources","knowledge resources"]}],"abstract":"Web service is a popular solution to integrate components when building a software system, or to allow communication between a system and third-party users, providing a flexible and reusable mechanism to access its functionalities.

In addition, they are sometimes ineffective due to patient co-morbidities, such as limited mobility, which limits patient participation.

In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture to utilize brain signals for controlling Internet of Things enabled environments.

It comprises of novel, low complex and low power intelligent signal processing architecture for detection of voluntary eye blinks by isolating involuntary eye blinks and IoT enabled wireless actuation network for controlling the environment using commands generated from EEG signal. For the real time performance analysis of the proposed architecture, we developed a wearable device which acquires dual channel EEG using electrodes at Fp1 and Fp2 locations. From the acquired EEG data, the device detects the voluntary eye blinks of the patient and use this information in controlling the environment such as switching HVAC system, lighting or electric fan etc. Performance analysis shows that the proposed intelligent signal processing architecture detects the voluntary eye blinks with 95.2% accuracy when tested on 10 subjects with a low power consumption of 165 mW.","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210814","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services

few years, Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry due to an increase in real-time data capturing and processing for patient monitoring. This has become possible due to the technological advancements in which high computing and communication facilities are available for most of the modern handheld devices. In this environment, computing resources are available close to the proximity of the end users using the most popular technology called as Fog computing (devices used in the fog computing are called as fog devices). Most of the solutions reported in the literature for this purpose have used the traditional cloud-based infrastructure in which there may occur a long delay for getting the response even for data which is not of very huge amount which may cause a performance degradation for most of the implemented solutions (such as for treatment of neurological diseases where a real-time monitoring is required) in this environment. Hence, to cope up these issues, in this paper, we proposed a fog computing based patient monitoring system for ambient assisted living (FAAL). Data traces of the movement of the patients (for neurological diseases) are collected using sensor nodes using body area networks (BANs) and are passed using the fog gateways. To reduce the load on the communication infrastructure, an efficient clustering algorithm for data transmission is also presented in the paper. Performance of the proposed solution has been evaluated using the parameters such as-latency, and data overloading. Results obtained clearly show the superior performance of the proposed scheme as compared to the non-fog computing based environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169616/8210752/08210825.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)","doi":"10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8210752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FAAL: Fog computing-based patient monitoring system for ambient assisted living","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Monitoring","Edge computing","Ambient assisted living"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["assisted living","body sensor networks","cloud computing","data communication","medical computing","patient monitoring","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time data capturing","fog devices","ambient assisted living","fog gateways","wireless body area networks","handheld devices","fog computing-based patient monitoring system","FAAL","sensor nodes","BAN","clustering algorithm","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Body Area Sensor Network","Fog Computing","Ambient Assisted living"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8210825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"FAAL: Fog computing-based patient monitoring system for ambient assisted living","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8210825/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17501674","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAAL: Fog computing-based patient monitoring system for ambient assisted living","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"p412vora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052268S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169616","isNumber":"8210752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169616","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8210752","articleId":"8210825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8210826,"authors":[{"name":"Jayneel Vora","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Jayneel","lastName":"Vora","id":"37086053232"},{"name":"Sudeep Tanwar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Sudeep","lastName":"Tanwar","id":"37077575700"},{"name":"Sudhanshu Tyagi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Thapar University, Patiala (Pb.), India"],"firstName":"Sudhanshu","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37077716000"},{"name":"Neeraj Kumar","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Thapar University, Patiala (Pb.), India"],"firstName":"Neeraj","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37395599700"},{"name":"Joel J P C Rodrigues","affiliation":["Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicacoes, Santa Rita do Sapucai, MG, BR"],"firstName":"Joel J P C","lastName":"Rodrigues"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6704-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6703-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6705-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8210826","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":719},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8210826","abstract":"Physical therapy has a lot of importance for the well being and a better quality of living for an elderly patient.

We propose a two-step procedure where the first step is to train a shallow bi-directional RNN in the general domain, and the second step is to transfer knowledge from the general domain to train a deeper bi-directional RNN for recognizing medical concepts from Chinese EMRs. Specifically, this is achieved by initializing the shallow parts of the deeper network in the second step with parameter weights from the bi-directional RNN trained in the first step. Then the deeper networks are re-trained on the Chinese EMRs.

Furthermore, an analytic solution exists only for an ideal model and only if the structure of the robot meets certain criteria. If enhanced positioning precision is required, the robot needs to be calibrated. This eliminates most of the errors due to the differences in the ideal model and the real robot. Calibration methods require additional computations (usually of iterative nature) in the real-time cycle of the control system and are only capable of dealing with small differences between the ideal model and the real robot. In this paper a supervised learning based approach is proposed to solve the inverse kinematics problem and the calibration. Instead of creating and ideal model for a series of robots and calibrating each of them individually afterwards, the inverse kinematics function is learned using a neural network and so, it is tailored to one given robot, already including errors due to manufacturing and/or assembly tolerances. Moreover, it can also work for structures for which no analytic solution is possible. The preliminary results of this research are presented in this paper, covering two simple robot structures, a planar 2 DOF and a spatial 3 DOF structure, both with and without artificially introduced assembly errors (joint misalignments) which make analytical modeling unfeasible.","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211457","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211426","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168204/8211426/08211457.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On solving the inverse kinematics problem using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211457/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On solving the inverse kinematics problem using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211457/","accessionNumber":"17432904","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On solving the inverse kinematics problem using neural networks","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"p367csiszar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044827S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168204","isNumber":"8211426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168204","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8211426","articleId":"8211457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8211465,"authors":[{"name":"Minh Nguyen","affiliation":["Computer & Mathematical Sciences Auckland, University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Minh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086041674"},{"name":"Huy Le","affiliation":["Computer & Mathematical Sciences Auckland, University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Le","id":"37086336715"},{"name":"Huy Tran","affiliation":["Computer & Mathematical Sciences Auckland, University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Huy","lastName":"Tran","id":"37086336660"},{"name":"Wai Yeap","affiliation":["Computer & Mathematical Sciences Auckland, University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Wai","lastName":"Yeap","id":"37563664800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6545-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6547-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8211465","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Three-dimensional displays","Lenses","Stereo vision","Image reconstruction","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","image matching","image reconstruction","image sensors","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo pictures","image sensor","fully functioning system","semiglobal stereo matching algorithm","vertical image alignment","efficient dynamic programming stereo matching","suitable depth image","stereo correspondence","simple stereo vision system","adaptive stereo vision system","low-cost 3D mini camera lens","multipurpose 3D stereo reconstruction","database sharing","stereo vision research community","stereo cameras","acquired image streams","higher-quality disparity maps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer stereo vision","robot system","3D re-construction"]}],"abstract":"This article describes the design and process of a 3D Mini Camera Lens to be utilised in multi-purpose 3D stereo reconstruction on computers, mobile devices and robots. It can also be useful for various tasks including demonstration, knowledge-sharing, online programming, database sharing, results comparison in the stereo vision research community, and recreation used by non-specialists. In contrast with many existing systems that use stereo cameras, our proposed one only use a single camera. However, the acquired image streams are divided into two side by side images by a 3D Mini Camera Lens. The use of the lens has some advantages over the state of the art ones. It is very low-cost, at 5-7 USD; it can be implemented with any small image sensors of web cams, smartphones, tablets. The lens is light weight, simple to assemble and disassemble, convenient and portable; and its two stereo pictures are perfectly synchronised (as the same image sensor produces them). We develop a fully functioning system which horizontally aligns images and calculates the dense distance map of the scene using a guided semi-global stereo matching algorithm. The simple horizontal and vertical image alignment is very lightweight, using adaptive methods, and is carried out during the stereo matching; thus, no separated processes are needed. The semi-global stereo matching uses full or partial profiles generated by local block matching algorithms to achieve an efficient dynamic programming stereo matching and produce higher-quality disparity maps. The system is, therefore, plug-and-play, no special setup or calibration is required. The system gradually estimates the best parameters, including disparity range, to produce the most suitable depth image. The evaluated results have shown that this system was demonstrably accurate, fast, and relatively robust for stereo correspondence. It could be used in many simple stereo vision system such as computer games, gesture control, robotic vision, self-flying drones or -driving cars.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive stereo vision system using portable low-cost 3D mini camera lens","publicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211465","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168204/8211426/08211465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive stereo vision system using portable low-cost 3D mini camera lens","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211465/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432868","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive stereo vision system using portable low-cost 3D mini camera lens","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"p161nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110712S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168204","isNumber":"8211426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168204","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8211426","articleId":"8211465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211486,"authors":[{"name":"K A N N P Gunawardena","affiliation":["University of Colombo School of Computing, Colombo, SriLanka"],"firstName":"K A N N P","lastName":"Gunawardena","id":"37086098754"},{"name":"R N Rajapakse","affiliation":["University of Colombo School of Computing, Colombo, SriLanka"],"firstName":"R N","lastName":"Rajapakse","id":"38548448500"},{"name":"N D Kodikara","affiliation":["University of Colombo School of Computing, Colombo, SriLanka"],"firstName":"N D","lastName":"Kodikara","id":"37891772300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6545-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6547-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8211486","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":741},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211486","abstract":"During the recent years, there have been many studies implemented on the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using different methods. The focus of most of these studies has relied upon the detection of AD from neu-roimaging data. However, recognizing symptoms early as much as possible(Pre-detection) is crucial as disease modifying drugs will be most effective if administered early in the course of disease, before the occurrence of irreversible brain damages. Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from such data. We report an experimental approach to evaluate the best pre-detection method of AD. Our study consists of two main experiments. Those two experiments were implemented using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Prior to our first experiment we have stated an assumption which is, if there is a successful AD detection method that will be successful in AD pre-detection also. Different studies have used different data sets and different diagnosing methods. Therefore we have verified the existing and the most successful detection method which is Support Vector Machine (SVMs) as the first experiment. According to the results obtained from the initial experiment (detection study) the sensitivity is 95.3%, the specificity is 71.4% and the accuracy is 84.4% with use of a SVM. Since those results were not successful, a deep learning based technique (Convolutional Neural Network) was proposed as the second experiment. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was being tested using different image segmentation methods and different datasets. Finally the best image segmentation method obtained a high accuracy around 96% (sensitivity - 96%, specificity - 98%). And the CNN model remains unbiased to the dataset. Results of those experiments suggest an important role for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using image processing and deep learning techniques.","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211486","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168204/8211426/08211486.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 24th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying convolutional neural networks for pre-detection of alzheimer's disease from structural MRI data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dementia","Support vector machines","Biological neural networks","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","correlation methods","diseases","feature extraction","image classification","image fusion","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neurophysiology","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","CNN","deep learning based technique","support vector machine","ADNI","experimental approach","irreversible brain damages","neu-roimaging data","convolutional neural network model","diagnosing methods","image segmentation methods","AD predetection","Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative","predetection method","image segmentation method","different datasets","detection study","initial experiment","successful detection method","different data sets","different studies","main experiments","disease modifying drugs","structural MRI data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alzheimers Disease","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Image Processing","Pattern Recognition","Support Vector Machine","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Applying convolutional neural networks for pre-detection of alzheimer's disease from structural MRI data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211486/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432905","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying convolutional neural networks for pre-detection of alzheimer's disease from structural MRI data","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"p173gunawardena.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107456S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168204","isNumber":"8211426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168204","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8211426","articleId":"8211486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8211535,"authors":[{"name":"L.

These low power requirements have emerged due to the advancement in technology where power is more important like medical, mobile phones, hand held devices etc. In subthreshold logic, the circuit operates with supply voltage less than that of the threshold voltage of the transistor and utilizes leakage current as the operating current. This is achieved as the dynamic power consumption is quadratic ally dependent on the supply voltage. To show the results we are implementing 4-bit adder in subthreshold adiabatic logic using FinFET technology which shows that the power consumed by FinFET adiabatic logic will be less than that of normal adiabatic operation operation.

To reduce the accidents sharing of the vehicle's dynamics information is essential. The primary vehicle uses several sensors to collect information which were transmitted to the next subordinate vehicles that follow it. For communicating huge data between vehicles we need a Multiple Input Multiple Output Radio Frequency (MIMO-RF) transceiver which leads to increase in complexity and cost of vehicle design. This drawback can be overcome by using the existing Visible Light Communication (VLC), because of the accessibility of light source and probability of seamless communication. In this paper, a Light Emitting Array (LEA) setup is likely to be placed which is the Region of Interest (ROI). The comparative distance between the camera and the LEA varies dynamically that leads to increase in average Bit Error Rate (BER) at the output of the detector. To overcome this problem, we proposed the Kalman filter methodology along with regular geometry techniques to locate and track the LEA and the deformed shape of LEA is corrected utilizing perspective projection that maximizes the average BER performance. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has an optimum performance than the existing method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211563","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169966/8211527/08211563.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual-MIMO for vehicle to vehicle communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211563/","displayDocTitle":"Visual-MIMO for vehicle to vehicle communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448572","htmlLink":"/document/8211563/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual-MIMO for vehicle to vehicle communications","confLoc":"Vellore, India","sourcePdf":"035ICMDCS2017paper310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074804S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169966","isNumber":"8211527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169966","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8211527","articleId":"8211563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211567,"authors":[{"name":"P.

As precision increases, Flash ADC requires large number of comparators compared to other ADCs. Hence, the increase in chip area, power consumption and cost of Flash converters makes trade off for many applications. So, the low power Flash ADC is aimed to be designed with less number of low power consumption comparators. The proposed Flash ADC of 4 bit resolution uses only four low power consumption comparators. The reference voltages from the diode connected transistorvoltage divider network is selected through the multiplexers and fed to the comparators. The proposed CMOS Flash ADC is implemented using Mentor Graphics EDA tool with MOS model library-TSMC 0.18um parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211567","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169966/8211527/08211567.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced comparators for low power flash ADC using TSMC018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211567/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reduced comparators for low power flash ADC using TSMC018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17448547","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8211567/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced comparators for low power flash ADC using TSMC018","confLoc":"Vellore, India","sourcePdf":"039ICMDCS2017paper44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051303S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169966","isNumber":"8211527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169966","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8211527","articleId":"8211567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8211570,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Recycling folded cascode amplifier exhibits improved performance in terms of gain, unity gain frequency, slew rate compared to the conventional folded cascode amplifier. While designing of gain boosting amplifier architectures employing cascode structures, designers often found it difficult to keep all the transistors in saturation to meet the desired circuit performance. Potential distribution method provides a design technique based on node voltage distribution for analog circuit designers, which guarantees that all the transistors are operated in saturation. PDM is independent of process technology, device dimensions and complex design equations governing the performance of individual devices and circuit. The designing of recycling folded cascode amplifier using PDM is carried out in UMC 180nm CMOS technology and simulation results were presented. A gain of 62.35 dB with a unity gain frequency of 53.5 MHz at a bandwidth of 42.1 kHz, when driving a load capacitance of 1pF is obtained.

This algorithm avoids estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel, and simplifies the initialization step of the classic successive cancellation decoder for Polar codes. These two simplifications are obtained without any significant loss in BER performance with respect to the classic SC decoder operating over the same channels, as we show by means of BER performance simulations. Impulsive noise is characterized by strong peak amplitude values that are added to the amplitude of the transmitted signal, thus significantly increasing the BER. A simple strategy based on the use of signal amplitude limiters can be used to mitigate this effect. We have applied limiters to both decoders, resulting in significant BER performance improvements.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Parity check codes","AWGN channels","Degradation","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","impulse noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal amplitude limiter","soft distance decoding algorithm","polar codes","impulsive noise channels","soft distance successive cancellation decoder","Middleton's Class A model","symmetric alpha-stable model","signal-to-noise ratio","BER performance simulations","strong peak amplitude values","decoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar Codes","Impulsive noise channels","Simplified decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211634","doi":"10.23919/RPIC.2017.8211634","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169970/8211611/08211634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/RPIC.2017.8211634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211611","publicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal amplitude limiter based soft distance decoding algorithm for polar codes over impulsive noise channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal amplitude limiter based soft distance decoding algorithm for polar codes over impulsive noise channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211634/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211634/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448708","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal amplitude limiter based soft distance decoding algorithm for polar codes over impulsive noise channels","confLoc":"Mar del Plata","sourcePdf":"035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068726S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169970","isNumber":"8211611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169970","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8211611","articleId":"8211634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Comisi Permanente RPIC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8211635,"authors":[{"name":"M.

LDPC and Polar codes are selected as efficient error-control codes operating over different channels. Channels under study are the classic Additive White Gaussian noise channel, the Rayleigh fading channel, and the Middleton's Class A impulsive noise channel. An efficient initialization step is performed when the initialization step uses estimates based on the corresponding probability density function of the channel, evaluated for the two possible transmitted signals of a binary transmission. However, real time evaluation of these estimates can be an operation of high complexity. A low complexity alternative decoding strategy is proposed, based on the estimation of square Euclidean distances propagated using antilog operations, in combination with a simple signal amplitude limiter. This low complexity strategy avoids the need of channel characteristics estimation, and results into a reasonable good BER performance, especially for decoding LDPC codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211635/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17448699","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8211635/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel characteristics dependence of the performance of decoding algorithms for efficient error-control codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel characteristics dependence of the performance of decoding algorithms for efficient error-control codes","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085941S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169970","isNumber":"8211611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169970","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8211611","articleId":"8211635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Comisi\u00f3n Permanente RPIC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8211637,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to prevent the fault propagation, provide protection against overload and fault, and isolate the faulty load in a dc power network, an overcurrent protection device must be applied to the switch gear for electric power management and control of the systems in dc power network. Overcurrent protection devises such as electromechanical circuit breaker in the primary and secondary distribution systems will protect all branch circuits on the load side of the discharge bus. This type of circuit breaker has the conflicting of time delay characteristics that trip delays must be long enough to open the circuit when a real fault exists. It should cause nuisance tripping. We are developing a solid state type of power switching circuit for dc power network instead of electromechanical circuit breaker. The candidate for these switching devices should be Power MOSFET, IGBT, and SiC MOSFET. Focusing on the application for the low and medium voltage dc grid, fast-acting switching function and current limiting features are brought up the idea to apply Si Power MOSFET, IGBT, and SiC MOSFET to the dc circuit breaker. The very basic evaluation for this fast-acting switching and current limiting function for the dc circuit breaker are shown by experiment in this paper. Our prototype switching device will open within 20 \u03bcs and we can freely adjust this elapsed time and fault current rating. To avoid nuisance tripping, we successfully performed current limiting function by extend the elapsed time using same control circuit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448353","htmlLink":"/document/8211688/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-26 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Basic evaluation for the dc circuit breaker using power semiconductor with fault current limiting feature","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basic evaluation for the dc circuit breaker using power semiconductor with fault current limiting feature","confLoc":"Broadbeach, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043349S","chronDate":"22-26 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168935","isNumber":"8211524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168935","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8211524","articleId":"8211688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211706,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Neuromorphic Engineering is one such domain which aims to exploit the physical characteristics of semiconductors to implement neural systems (and architectures to some extent). Synapse act as connection site and by the virtue of this long lasting connections, learning is exhibited in neural systems where it is governed by Hebbian rule. Memristors can store charge during the training process and respond in a desired manner, electronically mimicking synapse behaviour. The plasticity is achieved by variation in memristance based on the temporal coincidences of pre and post-synaptic spikes. We review the recent progress on the development of 2-terminal resistive device called memristors to mimic neuronal synapse based on Spike-timing-dependent plasticity protocol as an asymmetric form of hebbian learning. The properties of memristor such as high density, non-volatility, and recording historic behaviour of current profile with energy efficiency (identical to biological systems) makes it unique and paves a way for memristor-based neuromorphic computing architectures. The use of Memristor to realise synaptic activity provides even further surprising properties in analog CMOS Neuromorphic design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advent of memristor based synapses on neuromorphic engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211706","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211527","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169966/8211527/08211706.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Advent of memristor based synapses on neuromorphic engineering","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211706/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448511","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advent of memristor based synapses on neuromorphic engineering","confLoc":"Vellore, India","sourcePdf":"100ICMDCS2017paper106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068843S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169966","isNumber":"8211527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169966","xplore-issue":"8211527","articleId":"8211706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211722,"authors":[{"name":"R.

During the initial stage, the cloud computing environment faced complex problems due to multiplexing number of requests with available resources. The current state of the art is researchers have numerous solutions to resolve issues in handling CPU and RAM but, to the best of our knowledge; they have not considered an important factor, bandwidth. Also, many load balancing algorithms dont consider burst-conditions, which are serious issues for Cloud computing service provisioners since increase in burst time overhead results poor service time and response time. In this paper, the solution for these aforementioned problems, by using an algorithm called Predictive Load Balancing Algorithm (PLBA) is presented. PLBA is as flexible as possible, it can be used in burst and non-burst periods with maintaining service quality and consumes less amount of energy. PLBA predicts the resources before-hand and avoids overheads in non-burst periods. Also, it uses Right Scale Algorithm (RSA) to consolidate Virtual Machines (VM) into fewer physical machines. In bursts it applies round robin, to cope with overheads. We show that, PLBA can adapt in burst and non-burst conditions, with optimum use of physical machines and maintains the Quality of Service (QoS) without violating the Service Level Agreements (SLA). The system predicts the response time and service time have improved in both burst and non-burst periods with better quality of service.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169966/8211527/08211727.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive load balancing algorithm for cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Prediction algorithms","Quality of service","Bandwidth","Load management","Time factors","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","quality of service","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst-conditions","burst time","PLBA","cloud computing environment","load balancing algorithms","cloud computing service provisioners","predictive load balancing algorithm","right scale algorithm","virtual machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RSA","SLA","QoS","multiplexing","PLBA","VM","PM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Predictive load balancing algorithm for cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211727/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433765","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive load balancing algorithm for cloud computing","confLoc":"Vellore, India","sourcePdf":"121ICMDCS2017paper128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074047S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169966","isNumber":"8211527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169966","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8211527","articleId":"8211727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211728,"authors":[{"name":"Divya Prathana Timothy","affiliation":["SITE, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, (T.

It facilitates customers with effortlessness, quickness, competence etc in their work area through the services. Cloud provides huge data centre to handle the large amount of information. The Cloud Computing benefits the organizations to handle their large volume of information. The main issue in cloud computing is data security, because number of customers are sharing same cloud. This study aimed at designing a new security method by using a hybrid cryptosystem, for data security in the cloud. The need for the current investigation is to protect data from unauthorized access or hackers in cloud at the time of data transmission by encrypting the user data. Cloud computing constitutes several security issues including data access control, identity management, auditing, integrity control and risk management therefore, this hybrid cryptosystem is designed and comprises of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithm in which Blowfish symmetric algorithm deals with data confidentiality whereas, RSA asymmetric algorithm deals with an authentication. This method also includes the Secure Hash Algorithm -2 for data integrity. The present study concluded that the proposed method provides high security on data transmission over the internet and proper network access on demand to a shared tank of constructive computing resources, mainly net, server, and storage application.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169966/8211527/08211728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference on Microelectronic Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICMDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8211728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid cryptography algorithm for cloud computing security","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Cloud computing","Algorithm design and analysis","Digital signatures","Ciphers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","computer centres","cryptographic protocols","public key cryptography","risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["huge data centre","data security","security method","hybrid cryptosystem","data transmission","data access control","symmetric cryptography algorithm","asymmetric cryptography algorithm","data confidentiality","Secure Hash Algorithm","data integrity","hybrid cryptography algorithm","cloud computing security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blowfish","cloud-computing","cryptosystem","RSA","SHA-2"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid cryptography algorithm for cloud computing security","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8211728/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448532","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid cryptography algorithm for cloud computing security","confLoc":"Vellore, India","sourcePdf":"122ICMDCS2017paper129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129953S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169966","isNumber":"8211527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169966","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8211527","articleId":"8211728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8211845,"authors":[{"name":"Rajika L.

We study the outflows and jets from these systems to understand the contributions the circumstellar and circumbinary discs have on the efficiency and morphology of the outflow. In the single star and tight binary case, we obtain a single pair of jets launched from the system, while in the wide binary case, two pairs of jets are observed. This implies that in the tight binary case, the contribution of the circumbinary disc on the outflow is greater than that in the wide binary case. We also find that the single star case is the most efficient at transporting mass, linear and angular momentum from the system, while the wide binary case is less efficient ( \u223c 50\u2009per\u2009cent, \u223c 33\u2009per\u2009cent, \u223c 42\u2009per\u2009cent of the respective quantities in the single star case).

We study the reproduction, by the simulation, of quantities that trace the aggregate stellar-mass growth of galaxies over cosmic time: luminosity and stellar-mass functions, the star formation main sequence, rest-frame UV\u2013optical\u2013near-infrared colours and the cosmic star formation history. We show that Horizon-AGN, which is not tuned to reproduce the local Universe, produces good overall agreement with these quantities, from the present day to the epoch when the Universe was 5\u00a0per\u00a0cent of its current age. By comparison to Horizon-noAGN, a twin simulation without active galactic nuclei feedback, we quantify how feedback from black holes is likely to help shape galaxy stellar-mass growth in the redshift range 0 < z < 6, particularly in the most massive galaxies. Our results demonstrate that Horizon-AGN successfully captures the evolutionary trends of observed galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe, making it an excellent tool for studying the processes that drive galaxy evolution and making predictions for the next generation of galaxy surveys.","doi":"10.1093/mnras/stx126","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8211988/08211993.pdf","startPage":"4739","endPage":"4752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Horizon-AGN simulation: evolution of galaxy properties over cosmic time","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8211993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"The Horizon-AGN simulation: evolution of galaxy properties over cosmic time","volume":"467","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Horizon-AGN simulation: evolution of galaxy properties over cosmic time","sourcePdf":"stx126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025461S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","isNumber":"8211988","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","articleId":"8211993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8212534,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Rezvani","firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Rezvani"},{"name":"Mohammad Kazem Akbari","firstName":"Mohammad Kazem","lastName":"Akbari"},{"name":"Bahman Javadi","firstName":"Bahman","lastName":"Javadi"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8212534","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scheduling","resource allocation","cloud computing","IaaS","advanced reservation","integer linear programming"]}],"abstract":"Resource allocation is one of the main influential factors to provide efficient and economical processing of resources in the infrastructure as a service Clouds. While there are many challenges in providing an efficient resource allocator, maximizing the utilization of physical resources is of great importance. There are several works focused on optimizing the selection of virtual machines (VMs) for migration, however, there is less attention on the placement of the selected VMs on the available physical machines, especially for the advanced reservation request model. In this paper, the placement method and the impacts of different parameters are studied. First, different states of the problem are classified. Then, an algorithm based on integer linear programming (ILP) is proposed to solve some common cases of the problem. Finally, the algorithm is implemented in a Haizea simulator and the results are compared with the Haizea greedy algorithm and some other heuristics. The results reveal that the Haizea greedy algorithm is not able to utilize around 40% of the physical resources. Moreover, at low heterogeneity loads, the proposed ILP-based algorithm shows the same results as a Best-Fit algorithm, but at higher heterogeneity loads, the results of the proposed algorithm outperform other algorithms.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxu024","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8212529/08212534.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxu024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8212529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments Based on Integer Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8212534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212534/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments Based on Integer Linear Programming","volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments Based on Integer Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"bxu024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027284S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","isNumber":"8212529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8212534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8212717,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Verma","affiliation":["Astral institute Technical and Research, Indore, M.P."],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Verma","id":"37086321201"},{"name":"Pkumar Choure","affiliation":["Astral institute Technical and Research, Indore, M.P."],"firstName":"Pkumar","lastName":"Choure","id":"37086284418"},{"name":"Upendra Singh","firstName":"Upendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085620610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5685-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8212717","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8212717","abstract":"In the proposed work, we presented an Artificial Neural Network approach to predict the stock market indices.

The need to manage the applications in the cloud computing creates the challenge of an on-demand resource provisioning and allotment in response to the dynamically changing workloads. Currently, most of these existing methods are focused on the optimization of the allocating physical resources to their associated virtual resources and migrating virtual machines to achieve the load balance and increase the utilization of resource. Unfortunately, these methods require the suspension of the cloud computing applications due to the mandatory shutdown of associated virtual machines. In this paper, we study the resource allotment at application level, instead of studying as how to map the physical resources to the virtual resources for better utilization of resource in the cloud computing environment. We proposed a threshold-based Energetic Source allotment scheme for the cloud computing that allocates the virtual resources (virtual machines) dynamically among the cloud computing applications based on their load changes (instead of allocating the resources needed to meet the peak demands) and can use the threshold method to optimize the decision of the reallotment of resource. The proposed threshold-based Energetic Source allotment scheme is implemented by using the CloudSim, and experimental results show the proposed scheme can improve the utilization of resource and reduce the cost of user usage.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212744","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8212707/08212744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8212707","startPage":"638","endPage":"644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energetic SSource allotment scheme for cloud computing using threshold-based","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8212744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energetic SSource allotment scheme for cloud computing using threshold-based","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212744/","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17432998","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8212744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energetic SSource allotment scheme for cloud computing using threshold-based","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058433S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8212707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","xplore-issue":"8212707","articleId":"8212744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8212750,"authors":[{"name":"R Resmi","affiliation":["LBSITW, Kerala University, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Resmi","id":"38266752200"},{"name":"M.

In this paper, an important energy loss mechanism \u2014 ThermoElastic Damping (TED) effect in disc resonators is analyzed by evaluating the TED limited Quality factor. The Qfactor analysis results indicate a possible way to reach high quality factor by proper selection of the material of the disc structure. Simulations show the great importance of the material choice in order to reduce thermoelastic losses so that better Qfactors can be achieved at UHF range. These results represent an important step towards reaching the frequencies required by the RF front-ends in wireless transceivers. Finite element method is used to get an estimation for the thermoelastic losses and commercial FEM tool COMSOL is used for simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8212750/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17448191","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Material dependent thermoelastic damping limited quality factor analysis of disc resonators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Material dependent thermoelastic damping limited quality factor analysis of disc resonators","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047207S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8212707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","xplore-issue":"8212707","articleId":"8212750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8212751,"authors":[{"name":"T Vijetha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineeringline, Dept. name of organization MLR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"T","lastName":"Vijetha","id":"37086292779"},{"name":"U Dhana Laxmi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineeringline, Dept. name of organization MLR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"U Dhana","lastName":"Laxmi","id":"37086290754"},{"name":"P Badrinath","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineeringline, Dept. name of organization MLR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Badrinath","id":"37086287740"},{"name":"G Vamshidhar Reddy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineeringline, Dept. name of organization MLR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"G Vamshidhar","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37086288011"},{"name":"K Harun Reddy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineeringline, Dept. name of organization MLR Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"K Harun","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37086289744"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5685-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8212751","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cognitive radio","frequency agility","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","multifrequency antennas","multipath channels","planar antenna arrays","planar inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-element MIMO antenna","frequency tuning capability","4G wireless standards","multipath wireless channels","frequency reconfigurability","CR applications","planar inverted F shape antenna","frequency agile multiple-input multiple-output antenna","meander-line planar MIMO antenna","cognitive radio","FR4 substrate","size 1.56 mm","size 65 mm","size 120 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PIFA","Reconfigurable antenna","Cognitive radio","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"A novel meandered line, multi-band, planar inverted F shape frequency agile multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna is presented.

In the preprocessing stage, we have employed median filtering on the input characters and applied normalization and skeletonization method over characters for extraction of boundary edge pixel points. In the feature extraction stage, initially the each character is divided into 3\u00d73 grids and the corresponding centroid for all the nine zones are evaluated. With this we can identify the characters of different styles. There after, we have drawn the horizontal and vertical symmetric projection angel to the nearest pixel of the character which is dubbed as Binary External Symmetry Axis Constellation for unconstrained handwritten character. From which we have calculated the horizontal and vertical Euclidean distance for the same nearest pixel from centroid of each zone. Then we have calculated the mean Euclidean distance as well as the mean angular values of the zones. This is considered as the key feature values of our proposed system. Lastly, both support vector machine (SVM) and Quadratic discriminate Classifier (QDA) has been separately used as the classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212801","publicationTitle":"2017

It is a derivative free process and easy to implement. The main goal is to determine the optimum operating condition of the control variable and minimization of transmission losses at normal operating condition.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212830","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8212707/08212830.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8212707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based transmission expansion planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based transmission expansion planning","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17448188","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8212830/","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based transmission expansion planning","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063375S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8212707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8212707","articleId":"8212830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8212835,"authors":[{"name":"Anmol Khanna","affiliation":["Dubai Campus, Heriot-Watt University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Anmol","lastName":"Khanna","id":"37086271129"},{"name":"Senthil Arumugam Muthukumaraswamy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Heriot-Watt University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Senthil Arumugam","lastName":"Muthukumaraswamy","id":"38581041600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5686-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5685-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5687-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8212835","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Electromyography","Electrodes","Real-time systems","Feature extraction","Muscles","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","feature extraction","medical signal processing","microcontrollers","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin preparation","feature extraction","network training","effective performance","cost-effective system","surface electromyography","artificial neural networks","neural network","muscular intent classification","real-time testing","Arduino-based system","muscular intent acquisition","muscular intent decoding","Arduino microcontroller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromyography","Orthosis","Prosthesis","Neural Network","Muscular Intent","Arduino","Cost-Effective"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8212835","abstract":"This paper presents the implementation of a system to classify muscular intent.

This information is processed to acquire knowledge. However, the process of information extraction from a Database System is cumbersome for non-expert users as it requires an extensive knowledge of DBMS languages. Therefore, an inevitable need arises to bridge the gap between user requirements and the provision of a simple information retrieval system whereby the role of a specialized Database Administrator is annulled. In this paper, we propose a methodology for building an Intelligent Querying System (IQS) by which a user can fire queries in his own (natural) language. The system first parses the input sentences and then generates SQL queries from the natural language expressions of the input. These queries are in turn mapped with the desired information to generate the required output. Hence, it makes the information retrieval process simple, effective and reliable.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212846","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8212707/08212846.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8212707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IQS-intelligent querying system using natural language processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8212846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212846/","displayDocTitle":"IQS-intelligent querying system using natural language processing","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17432991","htmlLink":"/document/8212846/","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IQS-intelligent querying system using natural language processing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044899S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8212707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8212707","articleId":"8212846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8212849,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The single precision floating point arithmetic operations are multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. Among all these multiplication is extensively used and involves composite arithmetic functions. The single precision (32-bit) floating point number split into three parts namely Sign part, and Exponent part and Mantissa part. The most significant bit of the number is a sign bit and it is a 1-bit length. Next 8-bits represent the exponent part of the number and next 23-bits represent the mantissa part of the number. Mantissa part needs large 24-bit multiplication. The performance of the single-precision floating point number mostly based on the occupied area and delay of the multiplier. In this paper, performance comparison of multiplexer based single precision floating point multiplication using Array, Wallace tree and Vedic multipliers is done in terms of area and delay. These floating point multipliers modules are programmed and synthesized using Verilog in Xilinx ISE Simulator. Maximum propagated path delay and number of slices required on FPGA are compared for different multipliers. From the result it is concluded that Multiplexer based Vedic multiplier method has a great impact on improving the speed and reducing the area required on FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212851","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168799/8212707/08212851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA.2017.8212851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8212707","publicationTitle":"2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)","startPage":"430","endPage":"435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Comparative performance analysis of multiplexer based single precision floating point multipliers","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8212851/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17433033","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8212851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative performance analysis of multiplexer based single precision floating point multipliers","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064877S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168799","isNumber":"8212707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168799","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8212707","articleId":"8212851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8212858,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The OpenCL standard is very appealing because it provides code portability across most of these platforms. It defines a programming model where a host code requests the execution of kernels in computational devices. Unfortunately, the host application programming interface of OpenCL is quite verbose, which makes the development of its host code tedious and error-prone. More importantly, OpenCL does not provide automatic performance portability. As a result, users have to hand-tune OpenCL codes for each specific device, which implies trying different versions of the kernels and task partition granularities. As an answer to this situation, we present OCLoptimizer, a tool that automatically generates host codes and optimizes OpenCL kernels for each specific target device based on a user provided configuration file. This configuration file describes basic kernel characteristics and annotations in the kernels that indicate the code transformations to test. Our tool can explore different granularities for the problem decomposition as well as different alternatives for the kernel. This exploration is performed by means of an iterative optimization process whose parameters and search strategy are defined by the user specifications. Support for OpenCL codes composed of multiple kernels is also provided by the tool. Experiments performed on multicore CPUs and different accelerators show that the tool is very effective, generating codes with an average speedup of 2.54 with respect to baseline hand-tuned implementations, in single kernel codes and 1.79 in a code with multiple kernels.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxv038","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8213065/08213075.pdf","startPage":"3057","endPage":"3073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxv038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8213065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Generation of Optimized OpenCL Codes Using OCLoptimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8213075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Generation of Optimized OpenCL Codes Using OCLoptimizer","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Generation of Optimized OpenCL Codes Using OCLoptimizer","sourcePdf":"bxv038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045731S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"8213065","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","articleId":"8213075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8213081,"authors":[{"name":"L\u00e1szlo Lengyel","firstName":"L\u00e1szlo","lastName":"Lengyel"},{"name":"Tam\u00e1s M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros","firstName":"Tam\u00e1s","lastName":"M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros"},{"name":"M\u00e1rk Asztalos","firstName":"M\u00e1rk","lastName":"Asztalos"},{"name":"P\u00e9ter Boros","firstName":"P\u00e9ter","lastName":"Boros"},{"name":"Attila M\u00e1t\u00e9","firstName":"Attila","lastName":"M\u00e1t\u00e9"},{"name":"G\u00e1bor Mad\u00e1cs","firstName":"G\u00e1bor","lastName":"Mad\u00e1cs"},{"name":"P\u00e9ter Hud\u00e1k","firstName":"P\u00e9ter","lastName":"Hud\u00e1k"},{"name":"Krist\u00f3f Kov\u00e1cs","firstName":"Krist\u00f3f","lastName":"Kov\u00e1cs"},{"name":"Andr\u00e1s Tresch","firstName":"Andr\u00e1s","lastName":"Tresch"},{"name":"Hassan Charaf","firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Charaf"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8213081","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software modeling","requirements-engineering","requirements modeling","model-driven methods","communication platform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8213081","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxv051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxv051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8213065","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8213065/08213081.pdf","startPage":"3171","endPage":"3186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality Assured Model-Driven Requirements Engineering and Software Development","abstract":"Software development requires adequate methods for requirements engineering, design, development, testing and maintenance.

With the advances of cloud technology, operations such as discovery, scaling, monitoring and decommissioning are accomplished automatically. Therefore, negotiation between cloud clients and providers can be a bottleneck if it is carried out manually. Our objective is to propose a state-of-the-art solution to automate the negotiation process for cloud environments and specifically infrastructure as a service category. The proposed negotiation strategy is based on a time-dependent tactic. For cloud providers, the strategy uniquely considers utilization of resources when generating new offers and automatically adjusts the tactic's parameters to concede more on the price of less utilized resources. In addition, while the previous negotiation strategies in literature trust offered quality of service values regardless of their dependability, our proposed strategy is capable of assessing reliability of offers received from cloud providers. Furthermore, to find the right configuration of the time-dependent tactic in cloud computing environments, we investigate the effect of modifying parameters such as initial offer value and deadline on negotiation outputs that include ratio of deals made, and inequality index. The proposed negotiation strategy is tested with different workloads and in diverse market conditions to show how the time-dependent tactic's settings can dynamically adapt to help cloud providers increase their profits.","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxv053","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8213065/08213083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxv053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8213065","startPage":"3202","endPage":"3216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autonomous Time-Dependent SLA Negotiation Strategy for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8213083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"An Autonomous Time-Dependent SLA Negotiation Strategy for Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8213083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autonomous Time-Dependent SLA Negotiation Strategy for Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"bxv053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034407S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"8213065","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"8","articleId":"8213083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8213515,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Schwarzbach","firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Schwarzbach"},{"name":"Ralph-Uwe B\u00f6rner","firstName":"Ralph-Uwe","lastName":"B\u00f6rner"},{"name":"Klaus Spitzer","firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Spitzer"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8213515","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["numerical solutions","electromagnetic theory","marine electromagnetics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8213515","abstract":"We present a new 3-D vector finite element code and demonstrate its strength by modelling a realistic marine CSEM scenario.

Especially, it is difficult to detect and characterize transient excitations with attenuation by diffusion when their intensity is low compared to noise. This is a typical question in the search for the elusive translational motion of the inner core, the so-called Slichter triplet. This detection remains a non-trivial problem since the amplitude of the Slichter triplet is expected to be weak. Moreover, the characteristics (period, time of excitation and quality factor) of these low-intensity damped transient waves are poorly constrained. To improve the detection and characterization of such causal damped transient waves, we introduce a new continuous wavelet-based method using correlations with causal damped sinusoids that serve as the wavelet basis. This causal damped wavelet (CDW) method presents the advantage to give a direct estimate of the quality factor of the transient wave. After some synthetic tests, we present an application of the method to the time-varying gravity data recorded by superconducting gravimeters in the search for the Slichter triplet. No evidence of the Slichter triplet has been found in the 1-yr gravity data considered. However, we show that, thanks to the 3-D representation of our CDW method, it is possible to have a complete overview of the data set content and to constrain the detected events in terms of amplitude, quality factor, frequency and time.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03533.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03533.x","startPage":"55","endPage":"70","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8213913/08213917.pdf","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8213913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wavelet-based detection and characterization of damped transient waves occurring in geophysical time-series: theory and application to the search for the translational oscillations of the inner core","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A wavelet-based detection and characterization of damped transient waves occurring in geophysical time-series: theory and application to the search for the translational oscillations of the inner core","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"171","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8213917/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wavelet-based detection and characterization of damped transient waves occurring in geophysical time-series: theory and application to the search for the translational oscillations of the inner core","sourcePdf":"171155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03576S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","isNumber":"8213913","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8213917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8214088,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoyi Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214088/huang-2784094-small.gif","p":["Chaoyi Huang received the B.S. degree in electronic information engineering from the University of Electronic Science Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","He is currently with the Smart Hybrid Radio Laboratory, UESTC.

With a second harmonic suppression integrated into the output matching network of carrier power amplifier (PA) and peaking PA, respectively, the complex interaction of varying second harmonic impedances caused by dynamic load modulation can be eliminated and the second harmonic impedance remains the same reactance at both the output back-off (OBO) region and the saturated power. To meet the requirement of second harmonic termination, the DPA works in conventional class-J mode at the saturated power and a modified class-J continuum is proposed to expand the impedance design space at 8 dB OBO with good efficiency performance. A gallium nitride DPA is designed and fabricated to validate the method over a frequency band of 3.3-3.75 GHz. Under a 10%-duty-cycle pulse excitation, experimental results show the DPA delivers 48-48.8 dBm output power with a drain efficiency (DE) of 58%-71%. At 8 dB OBO, a measured DE of 44%-55% is achieved with a gain of 11.8-13.5 dB. When driven by a 2-carrier 40-MHz long-term evolution signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 8 dB, the DPA exhibits an adjacent channel leakage ratio of -30 dBc at an average output power of 40.7 dBm at 3.45 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"17573796","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8214088/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Broadband Modified Class-J Doherty Power Amplifier With Specific Second Harmonic Terminations","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571080 and 61271036"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design of Broadband Modified Class-J Doherty Power Amplifier With Specific Second Harmonic Terminations","sourcePdf":"access-huang-2784094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072518S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8214088","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214092,"authors":[{"name":"Chaofeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214092/cwang-2784239-small.gif","p":["Chaofeng Wang received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the M.Sc. degree in vehicle application engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

A fixed amount of information bits periodically arrive at the transmitter data queue, and wait for transmission via a number of packets within each epoch. To trade off energy consumption with transmission latency, the transmitter decides the transmission action at the beginning of each epoch, including to transmit or not, and the transmission power and the modulation-and-coding parameters, based on the data queue status and the predicted channel conditions in the current and future epochs. To describe both the fast fading and the large-scale shadowing of UWA channels, the channel within each epoch is characterized by a compound Nakagamilognormal distribution, and the evolution of the distribution parameters is modeled as an unknown Markov process. Given that the channel can only be observed during active transmissions, we formulate the adaptive transmission problem as a partially observable Markov decision process, and develop an online algorithm in a model-based reinforcement learning framework. The algorithm recursively estimates the channel model parameters, tracks the channel dynamics, and computes the optimal transmission action that minimizes a long-term system cost. Emulated results based on channel measurements from two-field experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves decent performance relative to a benchmark method that assumes perfect and non-causal channel knowledge.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/8274985/8214092-aam.pdf","topic":"Underwater Wireless Communications and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8214092/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542733","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Transmission in Time-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1551067"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000148","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1651135"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Transmission in Time-Varying Underwater Acoustic Channels","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2784239-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10198S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Underwater Wireless Communications and Networking"],"articleId":"8214092","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8214093,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214093/zhang-2782821-small.gif","p":["Yi Zhang (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the M.S. degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, China, in 2014 and 2017, respectively, and the Engineer\u2019s degree from the Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France.

This novel spectrum sharing framework exploits the NOMA technology to realize the simultaneous delivery of different messages to different user groups characterized by different geographical locations. The essence of the proposed framework is that the geographical information of user groups unites NOMA and multi-group multicast to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE) of wireless transmissions. Specifically, we investigate the downlink beamforming design of the proposed framework in multiple-input single-output settings. The decoding strategy for NOMA is designed and guaranteed by users' geographical information and required quality of service. The majorization and minimization algorithm is exploited to solve the non-convex and intractable problems therein. Comprehensive numerical experiments are further provided to show that NOMA holds tremendous promise but also limitations in terms of SE and EE, compared with spatial division multiple access and orthogonal multiple access.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782821","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08214093.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Assisted Multi-Region Geocast","topic":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Assisted Multi-Region Geocast","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17542734","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8214093/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671364"},{"fundingName":"Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201340"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Support Fund of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N005597/1"},{"fundingName":"H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015","grantNumber":"690750"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A1A05000977"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Assisted Multi-Region Geocast","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2782821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.277938S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Systems"],"articleId":"8214093","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214097,"authors":[{"name":"Mansour Taghadosi","affiliation":["American University of Sharjah, University City, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214097/tagha-2783045-small.gif","p":["Mansour Taghadosi received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in electronics/electrical engineering from the Ajman University of Science and Technology in 2012 and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the American University of Sharjah (AUS), United Arab Emirates, in 2015.

A detailed analytical model that supports the improved circuit model is given. The measurement results of both rectifier circuits show good agreement with the simulation results. The fabricated rectifiers' start to operate at -17.5-dBm input power. The tested frequency of operation of the rectifier circuits is 953 MHz (GSM900 band), however, other frequency bands such as 2.4 GHz (Bluetooth/WLAN) could be covered with proper impedance matching. The measured peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the implemented rectifiers are 84.37% and 56.16% at input power levels of -12.5 and -15 dBm, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest achieved PCE for the class of rectifiers at such low input power level in the literature. High sensitivity and excellent PCE of the presented rectifiers are ideal for utilization in wireless sensor network, Internet of Things, energy harvesting, and biomedical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08214097.pdf","startPage":"2397","endPage":"2409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783045","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Efficiency Energy Harvesters in 65nm CMOS Process for Autonomous IoT Sensor Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Transistors","Radio frequency","Charge pumps","Sensitivity","Energy harvesting","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","energy harvesting","impedance matching","integrated circuit modelling","Internet of Things","MOSFET circuits","rectifiers","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high efficiency energy harvesters","autonomous IoT sensor applications","RF-to-dc rectifier circuits","improved Dickson charge","metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors","conventional Schottky diodes","fully integrated circuits","measured peak power conversion efficiency","CMOS process","CMOS GlobalFoundries process","size 65.0 nm","frequency 953.0 MHz","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","radio frequency","GSM900","CMOS process","MOSFET","power conversion efficiency","sensitivity","dickson charge pump","rectifiers","flip-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"High Efficiency Energy Harvesters in 65nm CMOS Process for Autonomous IoT Sensor Applications","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8214097/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542735","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Texas Analog Center of Excellence","grantNumber":"MEES1 2011-HJ-2185"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"High Efficiency Energy Harvesters in 65nm CMOS Process for Autonomous IoT Sensor Applications","sourcePdf":"access-albasha-2783045-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067088S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8214097","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8214098,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Chi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE), Shanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Nan Chi (M\u201903\u2013SM\u201917) received the B.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1996 and\n 2001.","From July 2001 to December 2004, she was an Assistant Professor with the Research Center COM, Technical University\n of Denmark.

A sidelobe and energy optimization array node selection (SEOANS) algorithm is proposed for optimally selecting the sensor nodes to form a VNAA that optimizes the beam pattern of VNAA and reduces the average energy consumption of nodes. SEOANS uses a calculation method to determine the optimal number of array nodes, proposes a node location selection optimization method based on concentric circular ring array and a novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithm called cuckoo search chicken swarm optimization (CSCSO) to optimize the excitation current of each array node. CSCSO uses chaos theory, introduces the inertia weight L\u00e9vy flight, and adopts the grade mechanism in chicken swarm optimization to improve the performance of the cuckoo search algorithm. In addition, the scheduling and fault tolerance mechanisms are designed and implemented in SEOANS. Simulation results show that the node position selection optimization method and the excitation current optimization based on CSCSO can effectively reduce the maximum SLL. Furthermore, compared with traditional clustering routing algorithms, SEOANS has advantages in the communication delay and average energy consumption of nodes, thus effectively improving network lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08214099.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sidelobe and Energy Optimization Array Node Selection Algorithm for Collaborative Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Sidelobe and Energy Optimization Array Node Selection Algorithm for Collaborative Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214099/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8214099/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17573798","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373123"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"Chinese Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"[2016] 3100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004032","fundingName":"Graduate Innovation Fund of Jilin University","grantNumber":"2017016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Sidelobe and Energy Optimization Array Node Selection Algorithm for Collaborative Beamforming in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2783969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128956S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8214099","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8214102,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, Changzhou University, Changzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214102/yang-2784096-small.gif","p":["Biao Yang was born in Changzhou, Jiangsu, in 1987.

However, accurate hand-crafted features that are highly related to changes in expression are difficult to extract because of the influences of individual difference and variations in emotional intensity. Therefore, features that can accurately describe the changes in facial expressions are urgently required. Method: A weighted mixture deep neural network (WMDNN) is proposed to automatically extract the features that are effective for FER tasks. Several pre-processing approaches, such as face detection, rotation rectification, and data augmentation, are implemented to restrict the regions for FER. Two channels of facial images, including facial grayscale images and their corresponding local binary pattern (LBP) facial images, are processed by WMDNN. Expression-related features of facial grayscale images are extracted by fine-tuning a partial VGG16 network, the parameters of which are initialized using VGG16 model trained on ImageNet database. Features of LBP facial images are extracted by a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) built based on DeepID. The outputs of both channels are fused in a weighted manner. The result of final recognition is calculated using softmax classification. Results: Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can recognize six basic facial expressions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise) with high accuracy. The average recognition accuracies for benchmarking data sets \u201cCK+,\u201d\u201cJAFFE,\u201dand \u201cOulu-CASIA\u201dare 0.970, 0.922, and 0.923, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed FER method outperforms the state-of-the-art FER methods based on the hand-crafted features or deep networks using one channel. Compared with the deep networks that use multiple channels, our proposed network can achieve comparable performance with easier procedures. Fine-tuning is effective to FER tasks with a well pre-trained model if sufficient samples cannot be collected.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08214102.pdf","startPage":"4630","endPage":"4640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Weighted Mixture Deep Neural Network Based on Double-Channel Facial Images","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784096","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Weighted Mixture Deep Neural Network Based on Double-Channel Facial Images","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612578","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8214102/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501060 and 61703381"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150271"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory for New Technology Application of Road Conveyance of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BM20082061708"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Weighted Mixture Deep Neural Network Based on Double-Channel Facial Images","sourcePdf":"access-yang-2784096-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080722S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8214102","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8214104,"authors":[{"name":"Tharindu D.

Nonetheless, the lower achievable transmission efficiency and potential health concerns arising due to high power applications, have caused limitations in their further developments. Due to tremendous energy consumption growth with ever-increasing connected devices, alternative wireless information and power transfer techniques have been important not only for theoretical research but also for the operational costs saving and for the sustainable growth of wireless communications. In this regard, radio frequency energy harvesting (RF-EH) for a wireless communications system presents a new paradigm that allows wireless nodes to recharge their batteries from the RF signals instead of fixed power grids and the traditional energy sources. In this approach, the RF energy is harvested from ambient electromagnetic sources or from the sources that directionally transmit RF energy for EH purposes. Notable research activities and major advances have occurred over the last decade in this direction. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-art techniques, based on advances and open issues presented by simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and WPT assisted technologies. More specifically, in contrast to the existing works, this paper identifies and provides a detailed description of various potential emerging technologies for the fifth generation communications with SWIPT/WPT.

We interpret image reconstruction as a machine learning task and utilize deep networks as forward and inverse solvers for imaging. Specifically, we design a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture as an inverse solver based on the iterations of proximal gradient descent optimization methods. We further adapt the RNN architecture to image reconstruction problems by transforming the network into a recurrent auto-encoder, thereby allowing for unsupervised training. Our DL based inverse solver is particularly suitable for a class of image formation problems in which the forward model is only partially known. The ability to learn forward models and hyper parameters combined with unsupervised training approach establish our recurrent auto-encoder suitable for real world applications.

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is probably the most prominent method for extracting a single mode of variation in the data. However, in practice, several factors contribute to the appearance of visual objects including pose, illumination, and deformation, to mention a few. To extract these modes of variations from visual data, several supervised methods, such as the TensorFaces relying on multilinear (tensor) decomposition have been developed. The main drawbacks of such methods is that they require both labels regarding the modes of variations and the same number of samples under all modes of variations (e.g., the same face under different expressions, poses etc.). Therefore, their applicability is limited to well-organised data, usually captured in well-controlled conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel general multilinear matrix decomposition method that discovers the multilinear structure of possibly incomplete sets of visual data in unsupervised setting (i.e., without the presence of labels). We also propose extensions of the method with sparsity and low-rank constraints in order to handle noisy data, captured in unconstrained conditions. Besides that, a graph-regularised variant of the method is also developed in order to exploit available geometric or label information for some modes of variations. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in several computer vision tasks, including Shape from Shading (SfS) (in the wild and with occlusion removal), expression transfer, and estimation of surface normals from images captured in the wild.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2783940","startPage":"2682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8478843/08214214.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2783940","endPage":"2695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8478843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disentangling the Modes of Variation in Unlabelled Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Disentangling the Modes of Variation in Unlabelled Data","volume":"40","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8214214/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18145248","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2018","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2018","pubMedId":"29990016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC DTA"},{"fundingName":"Imperial College London"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC project","grantNumber":"FACER2VM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disentangling the Modes of Variation in Unlabelled Data","sourcePdf":"tpami-wang-2783940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14635S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8478843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8478843","articleId":"8214214","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8214218,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef El Baba","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen (A joint institution of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg and Fraunhofer IIS), Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/8318423/8214218/baba-2784298-small.gif","p":["Youssef\u00a0El\u00a0Baba (S\u201917) received the M.Sc. degree in\n communication systems, with a specialization in signal processing, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\n Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2015.

This paper outlines a method for inferring room geometry based on the positions of loudspeakers and real or image microphones, which are computed using sets of times of arrival (TOAs) obtained from room impulse responses (RIRs). These RIRs describe the acoustic propagation between the loudspeakers in an array and a single microphone. First, peaks corresponding to TOAs in these RIRs are detected and labeled using an automated method. Second, the labeled TOA sets are used to estimate the real and image microphone positions, with knowledge of the loudspeaker array geometry. Third, using all these positions, the positions of reflection points on the available reflectors in the room are determined. The reflection points determine the reflectors' locations and orientations. This approach is largely automated and usable in real-world scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","volume":"26","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17618511","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8214218/","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"3D Room Geometry Inference Based on Room Impulse Response Stacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Room Geometry Inference Based on Room Impulse Response Stacks","sourcePdf":"taslp-elbaba-2784298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13322S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8318423","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8318423","articleId":"8214218","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8214227,"authors":[{"name":"Moonsoo Ra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Moonsoo","lastName":"Ra","id":"37085536475"},{"name":"Mannan Saeed Muhammad","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, College of Information and Communication, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mannan Saeed","lastName":"Muhammad","orcid":"0000-0002-3036-4660","id":"37086323611"},{"name":"Chiawei Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea","Skymind Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiawei","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086323284"},{"name":"Sehui Han","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Pyeongteak, South Korea","Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sehui","lastName":"Han","id":"37086321807"},{"name":"Chansung Jung","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Robot Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chansung","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086321129"},{"name":"Whoi-Yul Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Whoi-Yul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086324024"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2372"}],"articleNumber":"8214227","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2150},"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Problems of the process \u2022 Different lighting conditions \u2022 Time limitation for correct diagnosis \u2022 Need to have both test strips and reference sheet Advantages \u2022 Less affected by lighting conditions \u2022 Rapid assessment \u2022 Self-contained configuration","type":"graphic","fileSize":"45KB","file":"/ielx7/6221039/8253365/8214227/graphical_abstract/jtehm-gagraphic-2765631.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6221039/8253365/8214227/graphical_abstract/jtehm-gagraphic-2765631.jpg"},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Strips","Color","Calibration","Medical diagnostic imaging","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colorimetry","image capture","image colour analysis","medical image processing","mobile computing","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smartphone-based point-of-care urinalysis","variable illumination","off-the-shelf reference sheet","tabular representation","urine test strips","reference color swatches","doughnut chart","colorimetric detection method","captured image","color spaces","environmental illumination conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smartphone","colorimetric","optical sensor","point-of-care","diagnostics","color-matching","urinalysis"]}],"abstract":"Urine tests are performed by using an off-the-shelf reference sheet to compare the color of test strips.

Thus, making it is difficult to distinguish between the subtle differences of shades on the reagent pads. This manuscript represents a new arrangement of reference arrays for urine test strips (urinalysis). Reference color swatches are grouped in a doughnut chart, surrounding each reagent pad on the strip. The urine test can be evaluated using naked eye by referring to the strip with no additional sheet necessary. Along with this new strip, an algorithm for smartphone based application is also proposed as an alternative to deliver diagnostic results. The proposed colorimetric detection method evaluates the captured image of the strip, under various color spaces and evaluates ten different tests for urine. Thus, the proposed system can deliver results on the spot using both naked eye and smartphone. The proposed scheme delivered accurate results under various environmental illumination conditions without any calibration requirements, exhibiting performances suitable for real-life applications and an ease for a common user.","doi":"10.1109/JTEHM.2017.2765631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2017.2765631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221039/8253365/08214227.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smartphone-Based Point-of-Care Urinalysis Under Variable Illumination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Smartphone-Based Point-of-Care Urinalysis Under Variable Illumination","volume":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8214227/","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"2800111","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17508323","pubMedId":"29333352","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214227/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Smartphone-Based Point-of-Care Urinalysis Under Variable Illumination","sourcePdf":"jtehm-muhammad-2765631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062612S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221039","isNumber":"8253365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221039","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8253365","articleId":"8214227","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214229,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-A Ahn","affiliation":["The authors are with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8412378/8214229/ahn-2783921-small.gif","p":["Hyun-A Ahn (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical and\n computer engineering in 2009 from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree in electronics and computer engineering at Hanyang University.","His research interests include power management IC design, LED lamp driver IC design, and micro-LED display driver\n IC design."]},"firstName":"Hyun-A","lastName":"Ahn","orcid":"0000-0001-9600-2139","id":"37085880867"},{"name":"Seong-Kwan Hong","affiliation":["The authors are with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8412378/8214229/hong-2783921-small.gif","p":["Seong-Kwan Hong (M\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electronic\n engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1980, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 1985 and 1994, respectively.","From 1990 to 1995, he was with Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, USA, where he developed several ECAD\n products.

The proposed LED lamp driver accurately maintains an average LED forward current by precisely adjusting the duration of the on- and off-times of the LED lamp driver. It also removes the low-frequency flicker by regulating the LED forward current without being affected by the low-frequency component of the ac line voltage. In addition, it reduces power consumption by eliminating the necessity of a high-voltage sensor or a high-side resistor, which causes conduction loss. The proposed average current controller was fabricated using a 0.18 \u03bcm bipolar, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, and double diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor process technology. The measurement results of the proposed LED lamp driver show that the variation in the average LED forward current is less than 0.6%, and the light flicker below 120 Hz is completely removed.

An adaptive algorithm for online tuning the sliding-mode coefficients of STA-SMO is proposed based on the existing stable conditions. Thus, position estimation error can be reduced by the proposed adaptive algorithm in wide-speed range. Furthermore, voltage distortion due to VSI nonlinearity is online compensated to improve the accuracy of PMSM model. Because mismatch between reference and actual voltage due to VSI nonlinearity may bring large rotor position and speed estimation error, especially in low-speed range where distorted voltages may become dominant compared to actual voltages. Thus, a STA-SMO with adaptive sliding-mode coefficients and accurate voltage value could be obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive STA-SMO with online VSI nonlinearity compensation is verified on a surface-mounted PMSM by experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8412378/08214230.pdf","startPage":"8994","endPage":"9004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2783920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2783920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Second-Order Sliding-Mode Observer for PMSM Sensorless Control Considering VSI Nonlinearity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Sensorless control","Rotors","Perturbation methods","Adaptation models","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","angular velocity control","compensation","control nonlinearities","observers","permanent magnet machines","position control","rotors","sensorless machine control","stability","synchronous machines","variable structure systems","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage distortion","PMSM model","rotor position","speed estimation error","accurate voltage value","adaptive STA-SMO","online VSI nonlinearity compensation","adaptive second-order sliding-mode observer","voltage source inverter nonlinearity","adaptive algorithm","position estimation error","PMSM sensorless control","stable conditions","VSI nonlinearity","adaptive super-twisting algorithm based sliding-mode observer","surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine sensorless control","surface-mounted PMSM sensorless control","adaptive sliding-mode coefficients online tuning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive super-twisting algorithm (STA)","permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)","sensorless control","sliding-mode observer","voltage-source inverter (VSI) nonlinearity compensation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Second-Order Sliding-Mode Observer for PMSM Sensorless Control Considering VSI Nonlinearity","volume":"33","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8214230/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17935434","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2015CB251301"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407082"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Second-Order Sliding-Mode Observer for PMSM Sensorless Control Considering VSI Nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2783920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084854S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8412378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"8412378","articleId":"8214230","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8214233,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian D\u00f6rner","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8295180/8214233/dorne-2784180-small.gif","p":["Sebastian D\u00f6rner received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n electrical engineering and information technology in 2014 and 2017, respectively, from the University of Stuttgart,\n Stuttgart, Germany, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

It allows learning of transmitter and receiver implementations as deep neural networks (NNs) that are optimized for an arbitrary differentiable end-to-end performance metric, e.g., block error rate (BLER). In this paper, we demonstrate that over-the-air transmissions are possible: We build, train, and run a complete communications system solely composed of NNs using unsynchronized off-the-shelf software-defined radios and open-source deep learning software libraries. We extend the existing ideas toward continuous data transmission, which eases their current restriction to short block lengths but also entails the issue of receiver synchronization. We overcome this problem by introducing a frame synchronization module based on another NN. A comparison of the BLER performance of the \u201clearned\u201d system with that of a practical baseline shows competitive performance close to 1 dB, even without extensive hyperparameter tuning. We identify several practical challenges of training such a system over actual channels, in particular, the missing channel gradient, and propose a two-step learning procedure based on the idea of transfer learning that circumvents this issue.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"12","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17581583","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8214233/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Communication Over the Air","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Communication Over the Air","sourcePdf":"jstsp-dorner-2784180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073334S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8295180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"8295180","articleId":"8214233","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214234,"authors":[{"name":"Jiacheng Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiacheng","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0002-2486-7018","id":"37086184171"},{"name":"Jin Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Wei","orcid":"0000-0001-6124-0110","id":"37085666504"},{"name":"Gaofei Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Gaofei","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0002-1051-588X","id":"37085706696"},{"name":"Zhaofu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zhaofu","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1406-1256","id":"37085717122"},{"name":"Qingkai Qian","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Qingkai","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086042735"},{"name":"Zheyang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zheyang","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0002-6455-9300","id":"37086299705"},{"name":"Mengyuan Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Mengyuan","lastName":"Hua","orcid":"0000-0003-3016-1588","id":"37085368139"},{"name":"Kevin J.

Resulting TCs profit from a joint optimization of puncturing pattern and interleaver to achieve an improved error rate performance. First, the puncturing pattern is selected based on the constituent code Hamming distance spectrum and on the TC extrinsic information exchange under uniform interleaving. Then, the interleaver function is defined via a layered design process taking account of several design criteria, such as minimum span, correlation girth, and puncturing constraints. We show that applying interleaving with a periodic cross connection pattern that can be assimilated to a protograph improves error-correction performance when compared to the state-of-the-art TCs. An application example is elaborated and compared with the long-term evolution standard: a significant gain in performance can be observed. An additional benefit of the proposed technique resides in the important reduction of the search space for the different interleaver parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8359223/08214245.pdf","startPage":"1833","endPage":"1844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protograph-Based Interleavers for Punctured Turbo Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Protograph-Based Interleavers for Punctured Turbo Codes","volume":"66","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8214245/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17754520","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214245/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPIC project of the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"760150"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protograph-Based Interleavers for Punctured Turbo Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-garzonbohorquez-2783971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119224S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8214245","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214247,"authors":[{"name":"Zijian Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering and the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zijian Du, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Du","orcid":"0000-0002-4161-6624","id":"37085797141"},{"name":"Francis Tsow","affiliation":["Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Francis Tsow, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Tsow","orcid":"0000-0002-3129-0624","id":"38109047700"},{"name":"Di Wang","affiliation":["Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Di Wang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-1581-4982","id":"37086281832"},{"name":"Nongjian Tao","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering and the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nongjian Tao, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Nongjian","lastName":"Tao","id":"37275257800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-437X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1748"},{"format":"CD","value":"2379-9153"}],"articleNumber":"8214247","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Sensors Council","url":"http://www.ieee-sensors.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chemicals","Detectors","Imaging","Real-time systems","Molecular sieves","Separation processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromatography","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gas chromatographs","time imaging","chemical separation","multidimensional GC development","chemical separation processes","real-time chemical separation","spiral microchannel column","miniaturized molecular sieve","gaseous chemical mixtures","surface plasmon resonance imaging microGC","integrated microcolumn","real-time imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gas chromatography (GC)","micro-GC","chemical separation","GC column","GC detector","surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi)","miniturization and integration"]}],"abstract":"An integrated and miniaturized micro-gas chromatography (GC) with real-time imaging capability for simultaneous chemical separation and detection was developed.

The highlights of this paper lie in two parts. On the theoretical end, through exploring the relationship among the coding, storage, and transmission, a systematic energy-saving content delivery fashion is investigated. On the technical end, a totally distributed content delivery system is designed in a simple and efficient manner, in which each device only utilizes local information to make decisions and implements its own scheme individually. Importantly, the proposed scheme is realized in a practical smart city system, and numerical results demonstrate that it is flexible to various users' needs and communication environments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8331183/08214249.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1634","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2784100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2784100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8331183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Greening the Smart Cities: Energy-Efficient Massive Content Delivery via D2D Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Greening the Smart Cities: Energy-Efficient Massive Content Delivery via D2D Communications","htmlLink":"/document/8214249/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17682767","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571240 and 61671474"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars","grantNumber":"BK20170089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Greening the Smart Cities: Energy-Efficient Massive Content Delivery via D2D Communications","sourcePdf":"tii-liang-2784100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108753S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8331183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"8331183","articleId":"8214249","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8214250,"authors":[{"name":"Yuezu Lv","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuezu","lastName":"Lv","orcid":"0000-0002-7757-9028","id":"37085714624"},{"name":"Zhongkui Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongkui","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-9361-4305","id":"37309818000"},{"name":"Zhisheng Duan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Turbulence and Complex Systems, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Duan","orcid":"0000-0003-3538-2494","id":"37305271000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8214250","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":777},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214250","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PI control","Adaptive control","Laplace equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Networked control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","directed graphs","distributed control","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","linear network analysis","matrix algebra","PI control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed adaptive PI controllers","heterogeneous linear networks","directed graph","asymmetric Laplacian matrix","proportional and integral terms","protocol design problem","eigenvalue information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked control systems","cooperative control","consensus","directed graph","adaptive control"]}],"abstract":"This brief works on the distributed adaptive consensus protocol design problem of heterogeneous linear networks over directed graphs.

To describe the phenomenon of imperfect transmission between the system and the controller, a mode-dependent stochastic measurement fading model is adopted. By introducing two mutually independent and mode-dependent fading channel coefficients, the undulation of communication workload caused by the change of system mode can be accurately described. Also, the mixed time delays including the discrete and the infinite distributed delays are considered. Our goal is to design a reliable controller, which can guarantee the passivity of the closed-loop control system even when some sensors experience faults or failures. To realize this reliable controller, we introduce an additional matrix and utilize some inequality techniques. By using Lyapunov function technique, the gain of the designed controller can be solved. The merits and effectiveness of the developed design scheme are verified by a simulation example.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2778298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2778298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8612989/08214254.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Control Against Sensor Failures for Markov Jump Systems With Unideal Measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Control Against Sensor Failures for Markov Jump Systems With Unideal Measurements","volume":"49","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8214254/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18379361","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214254/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61621002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005153","fundingName":"China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists","grantNumber":"61425009"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Higher Vocational Colleges and Schools Pearl River Scholar approved in 2015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1611262 and 61603102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LR16F030001"},{"fundingName":"China National 863 Technology Projects","grantNumber":"2015BAF32B03-05"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017FZA5010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Control Against Sensor Failures for Markov Jump Systems With Unideal Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsmc-lu-2778298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142427S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8612989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8612989","articleId":"8214254","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214255,"authors":[{"name":"Rafay Iqbal Ansari","affiliation":["Frederick University, Nicosia, CY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8543256/8214255/ansar-2773633-small.gif","p":["Rafay Iqbal Ansari (GS'15) is currently working toward the Ph.D.\n degree in computer engineering at Frederick University, Nicosia, Cyprus.","He is an active Researcher with the Networks Research Laboratory (NETLAB), Department of Computer Science and\n Engineering, Frederick University.

The fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems promise to improve the existing technology according to the future demands and provide a road map for reliable and resource-efficient solutions. Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been envisioned as an allied technology of 5G wireless systems for providing services that include live data and video sharing. A D2D communication technique opens new horizons of device-centric communications, i.e., exploiting direct D2D links instead of relying solely on cellular links. Offloading traffic from traditional network-centric entities to D2D network enables low computational complexity at the base station besides increasing the network capacity. However, there are several challenges associated with D2D communication. In this paper, we present a survey of the existing methodologies related to aspects such as interference management, network discovery, proximity services, and network security in D2D networks. We conclude by introducing new dimensions with regard to D2D communication and delineate aspects that require further research.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2017.2773633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8543256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2773633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8543256/08214255.pdf","startPage":"3970","endPage":"3984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5G D2D Networks: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Prospects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"5G D2D Networks: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Prospects","volume":"12","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8214255/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18281205","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Erasmus Mundus LEADERS Doctorate Level Mobility program"},{"fundingName":"European Union"},{"fundingName":"National Funding from the FCT - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"},{"fundingName":"Government of the Russian Federation","grantNumber":"074-U01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007258","fundingName":"Funttel","grantNumber":"01.14.0231.00"},{"fundingName":"Centro de Refer\u00eancia em Radiocomunica\u00e7\u00f5es - CRR project of the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es (Inatel), Brazil"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G D2D Networks: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Prospects","sourcePdf":"jsyst-rodrigues-2773633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197612S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8543256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"8543256","articleId":"8214255","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214261,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8436087/8214261/yang-2783974-small.gif","p":["Jian Yang received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

Dynamic video layer selection and resource allocation are invoked to enable the adaptation of the scalable video streaming service to the dynamics of both channel quality and interference price fluctuations. We formulate the design as a constrained stochastic optimization problem, which strikes a compelling compromise between the perceivable quality of experience and the monetary implications of the interference. Since the time scale of resource allocation is more short term than that of the video layer selection, we decompose the original long-term utility optimization problem into a pair of readily tractable subproblems with the aid of two different time-scales by invoking the powerful technique of Lyapunov drift and optimization. By exploiting the specific structure of these subproblems, low-complexity algorithms are derived for dynamic video layer selection and resource allocation, which rely on the near-instantaneously available information rather than on any prior statistical knowledge. Finally, we derive the analytical bounds of the theoretically achievable performance. Experimental results are presented for characterizing the performance attained.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8436087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2783974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8436087/08214261.pdf","startPage":"3455","endPage":"3470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation and Layer Selection for Scalable Video Streaming in Femtocell Networks: A Twin-Time-Scale Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation and Layer Selection for Scalable Video Streaming in Femtocell Networks: A Twin-Time-Scale Approach","volume":"66","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8214261/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18000951","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214261/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573329"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61233003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant Beam-Me-Up"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation and Layer Selection for Scalable Video Streaming in Femtocell Networks: A Twin-Time-Scale Approach","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hanzo-2783974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113889S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8436087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8436087","articleId":"8214261","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214267,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Niu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Niu","orcid":"0000-0002-3680-5594","id":"38490751400"},{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-7149-5712","id":"37715514300"},{"name":"Huan Li","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Li","id":"37085873975"},{"name":"Xuejun Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Xie","id":"37274128300"},{"name":"Naif D.

First, a well-designed nonlinear mapping is introduced to transform the switched stochastic system to a new system without constraints, which implies the controller design of the transformed system is equivalent to that of the stochastic switched system. Then radial basis function NNs are applied to model the unknown nonlinearities and the adaptive backstepping technique is employed to construct two classes of adaptive neural controllers under different adaptive laws. It is proved that both controllers can assure all the signals in the closed-loop remain bounded in probability, and the tracking error finally converges to a neighborhood of the origin without violating the constraint. Furthermore, the use of the nonlinear mapping to deal with the asymmetric output constraint is also studied as a generalization result. Two illustrative examples with numerical data and simulation results are given to show the validity and performance of the proposed control schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control Scheme for Output-Constrained Stochastic Switched Nonlinear Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2777472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8612989/08214267.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2777472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612989","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control Scheme for Output-Constrained Stochastic Switched Nonlinear Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8214267/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18379369","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673073 and 61673242"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"201602009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Neural-Network-Based Adaptive Control Scheme for Output-Constrained Stochastic Switched Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-niu-2777472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168264S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8612989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8612989","articleId":"8214267","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8214281,"authors":[{"name":"Tapiwa Moses Chiwewe","affiliation":["IBM Research, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8426041/8214281/chiwe-2783973-small.gif","p":["Tapiwa Moses Chiwewe (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the\n B.Eng., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, in\n 2006, 2010, and 2016, respectively.","He was a Software Developer with the Fifth Dimension Technologies from 2008 to 2011, and a Senior Research Engineer\n with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, South Africa, from 2011 to 2015.

The modified algorithm is tailored for faster convergence and scalability and makes use of a novel simultaneous multichannel sensing and access technique.

The design combines two novel techniques: data compression in the analog domain (Xampling) and compressed sensing (CS). The developed system allows an efficient reconstruction of signals from a smaller number of samples than the required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. A critical point in CS technique is the choice of the sampling matrix, which is classically constructed using random sequences. These sequences are computationally expensive to generate, so in this work, we study the usage of chaotic sequences. In addition to that, we propose performance quantifiers to evaluate the modeled system. Finally, we conclude that the system implemented with chaos have a similar behavior compared to the conventional system.","doi":"10.23919/RPIC.2017.8214342","publicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169970/8211611/08214342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/RPIC.2017.8214342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211611","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Xampling and chaotic compressive sensing signal acquisition and reconstruction system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Xampling and chaotic compressive sensing signal acquisition and reconstruction system","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214342/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448694","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8214342/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Xampling and chaotic compressive sensing signal acquisition and reconstruction system","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071781S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169970","isNumber":"8211611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169970","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8211611","articleId":"8214342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Comision Permanente RPIC","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8214355,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Rodriguez Rivero","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Cristian Rodriguez","lastName":"Rivero","id":"38666464900"},{"name":"Julian Pucheta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Pucheta","id":"37691496800"},{"name":"Paula Otano","affiliation":["Computer Science School, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Pablo, Arequipa, Peru"],"firstName":"Paula","lastName":"Otano","id":"37086316806"},{"name":"Yvan Tupac Valdivia","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Yvan Tupac","lastName":"Valdivia","id":"37086316883"},{"name":"Efren Gorrostieta","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Tecnologica Nacional, Cordoba, Argentina"],"firstName":"Efren","lastName":"Gorrostieta","id":"37658479100"},{"name":"Sergio Laboret","affiliation":["Laboratory of Mecatronics, Autonomous University of Queretaro, Queretaro, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Laboret","id":"38666598400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-987-544-754-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6286-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8214355","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","time series","wind power","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind power series prediction","BEAmod","nonlinear system","system inputs","wind power forecasting system","short-term prediction","forecasting method","predictability","short-term wind time series","dynamical system","Bayesian enhanced modified based-neural network","complex multidimensional nonlinear mapping","data model","information extraction","temporal dependencies","nonlinear dependencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind energy power","time series forecasting","Bayesian Enhanced modified approach (BEAmod.)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214355","abstract":"In this paper, wind power series prediction using BEA modified (BEAmod.) neural networks-based approach is presented.

The focus, with particularly interest in short-term prediction, is by using the data model selected, in which the Bayesian enhanced modified approach (BEAmod.) is used to extract information to make prediction.

Forest-land use change, deforestation, unplanned urbanization, localization of marginal population groups in vulnerable areas, wild fires, high temperatures, unusual precipitations, among others are some of the variables that increase the probability of a water-related catastrophe. Comprehensive hazard assessments and appropriated environmental policies orientated towards risk management complemented with planning and designing of hydraulic infrastructures may contribute to decrease flash flooding risk a well as the magnitude of the potential damages. The aim of this study is to develop a consistent methodology to determine the vulnerability, threat and risk of mountain urban areas that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of heavy, rapid rains and represent the obtained results in a risk map. Identifying risk prone areas can be achieved by adapting geological-geotechnical charts, hydrological models, field inventories and official census data from the town of Unquillo, in the province of Cordoba, Argentina. The analytic hierarchy process was used in order to determine the individual contribution of each vulnerability factor, together with geographical information systems used to combine the obtained information trough algebra and transformation of satellite imagery bands. The case of study show that 59% of the total flooding vulnerability relates to the buildings infrastructure, followed by the social factors which represent 33% of the total vulnerability equation. The threat map was validated using landmarks and remains obtained as a consequence of the flooding that occurred on February 15th 2015 in the study area.","doi":"10.23919/RPIC.2017.8214379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8211611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/RPIC.2017.8214379","publicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169970/8211611/08214379.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk mapping of urban areas prone to flash floods in mountain basins using the analytic hierarchy process and geographical information systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Risk mapping of urban areas prone to flash floods in mountain basins using the analytic hierarchy process and geographical information systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17419095","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214379/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk mapping of urban areas prone to flash floods in mountain basins using the analytic hierarchy process and geographical information systems","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03979S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2017","isNumber":"8211611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169970","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8214379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8214542,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Besides human influence due to the dependence on a priori information for starting models and interpretation of p\u2014f spectra as well as noise, the model resolution of the inversion problem is strongly influenced by the multimodality of the misfit function. We thus tested the efficiency of global, stochastic optimization approaches with focus on swarm intelligence methods that can explore the multiple minima of the misfit function. A comparison among different PSO schemes by applying them to synthetic Scholte-wave spectra led to a hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimization and Downhill Simplex providing the best resolution of inverted shear wave velocity depth models. The results showed a very low spread of best fitting solutions of 7 per cent in shear wave velocity and an average of 9 per cent for noisy synthetic data and a very good fit to the true synthetic model used for computation of the input data. To classify this method we also compared the probability of finding a good fit in synthetic spectra inversion with that of Evolutionary Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Neighbourhood Algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. Again the hybrid optimization scheme showed its predominance. The usage of stochastic algorithms furthermore allowed a new way of misfit definition in terms of dispersion curve slowness residuals making the inversion scheme independent on Scholte-wave mode identification and allowing joint inversion of fundamental mode and higher mode information. Finally we used the hybrid optimization scheme and the misfit calculation for the inversion of 2-D shear wave velocity profiles from two locations in the North- and Baltic Sea. The models show acceptable resolution and a very good structural correlation to high resolution reflection seismic data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"July 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"190","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the application of Particle Swarm Optimization strategies on Scholte-wave inversion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of Particle Swarm Optimization strategies on Scholte-wave inversion","sourcePdf":"1901580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052754S","chronDate":"July  2012","isNumber":"8214500","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8214542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8214757,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Electromagnetic fields emitted by large surface current-driven loops are employed to locate and quantify groundwater reservoirs. The oscillating magnetic fields interact with proton spins of water molecules in the electrically conductive subsurface. To study the influence of changing subsurface electrical properties on the nuclear spin response, we consider the spin magnetization as a virtual magnetic dipole receiver. The numerical solutions for the electric and magnetic fields of the transmitter and the virtual receiver in 3-D heterogeneous ground are based on the finite-element method. We explicitly compute the frequency-domain electromagnetic sensitivities for separate spin magnetizations in a groundwater aquifer to study the distortion of the NMR response because of electrical heterogeneities in the medium. Analyses of entire pulse moment sequences yield the cumulative sensitivities to electrical conductivity and water-content variations in the subsurface. We illustrate the influence of conductivity on NMR responses using a limited number of models. From these models we found that electrical conductivity anomalies in the shallow subsurface (<50 m) having values =0.1 S m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n and volumes with linear dimensions in the order of our loop size (i.e. edge length 100 m) can have a strong influence on the NMR response and ought to be taken into account in the inversion of surface-NMR data.

We consider a scenario, where multiple single-antenna UAVs simultaneously communicate with a ground station (GS) equipped with a large number of antennas. Specifically, we discuss the achievable uplink (UAV to GS) capacity performance in the case of line-of-sight conditions. We develop a realistic geometric model, which incorporates an arbitrary orientation, of the GS and UAV antenna elements to characterize the polarization mismatch loss, which occurs due to the movement and orientation of the UAVs. A closed-form expression for a lower bound on the ergodic rate for a maximum-ratio combining receiver with estimated channel state information is derived. The optimal antenna spacing that maximizes the ergodic rate achieved by an UAV is also determined for uniform linear and rectangular arrays. It is shown that when the UAVs are spherically uniformly distributed around the GS, the ergodic rate per UAV is maximized for an antenna spacing equal to an integer multiple of one-half wavelength.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","volume":"17","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17617702","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8214963/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO for Communications With Drone Swarms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR) and ELLIIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO for Communications With Drone Swarms","sourcePdf":"twc-chandhar-2782690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148991S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8214963","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214966,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8576800/8214966/du-2777463-small.gif","p":["Haibo Du (M\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2012.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China.

Based on a nonsmooth backstepping design, a novel consensus formation control algorithm is proposed and utilized. First, for the position control subsystem, based on the linear quadratic regulator optimal design method, a formation control law for multiple quadrotor aircraft is designed such that the positions of all the quadrotor aircraft converge to the desired formation pattern. The designed formation control law for position systems will generate the desired attitude for the attitude control systems. Second, for the attitude control subsystem described by unit quaternion, by employing the technique of finite-time control and switch control, a global bounded finite-time attitude tracking controller is designed such that the desired attitude can be tracked by the multiple quadrotor aircraft in finite time.

The state vector, mixing parameters, scale matrices, and shape parameters are simultaneously inferred utilizing standard variational Bayesian approach. As the implementations of the proposed method, several solutions corresponding to some special GSM distributions are derived. The proposed robust Kalman filters are tested in a manoeuvring target tracking example. Simulation results show that the proposed robust Kalman filters have a better estimation accuracy and smaller biases compared to the existing state-of-the-art Kalman filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2019","volume":"49","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"19030902","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2019","publicationDate":"Oct. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8214971/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Kalman Filters Based on Gaussian Scale Mixture Distributions With Application to Target Tracking","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773133, 61633008, 61773131 and U1509217"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005046","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"F2016008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003471","fundingName":"Harbin Engineering University","grantNumber":"HEUCFP201705 and HEUCF041702"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Student Research and Innovation Fund of the Fundamental Research Founds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HEUGIP201706"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K014307/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP170102644"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B17048 and B17017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Kalman Filters Based on Gaussian Scale Mixture Distributions With Application to Target Tracking","sourcePdf":"tsmc-zhang-2778269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197625S","chronDate":"Oct.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8839652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8839652","articleId":"8214971","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8214974,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhao Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8214974/wang-2783880-small.gif","p":["Yuhao Wang (SM\u201914) was born in Hubei, China, in 1977.

It takes into account the idle probability of access points (APs) that are not associated with any users and hence do not function as the source of interference. The idle probability of APs is evident especially in underloaded networks as well as general networks that operate with an AP sleep strategy to save energy and/or minimize the co-channel interference. Due to the absence of the \u201cmultipath fading\u201d effect, the evaluation of the distribution function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is more challenging in VLC networks than in radio frequency-based cellular networks. By using the statistical-equivalent transformation of the SINR, analytical expressions for the coverage probability are derived and given in tractable forms. Comparing the derived results with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we show that assuming a thinned homogeneous Poisson point process for modeling active APs is valid in general, and it gives close results to the exact ones when the density of users is no less than the density of APs in the network. Both analytical and simulation results show that, for typical receiver noise levels (~-117 dBm), approximating the SINR by the signal-to-interference ratio is sufficiently accurate for the coverage analysis in VLC networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08214975.pdf","startPage":"1630","endPage":"1643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2782694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2782694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8214975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Multiuser Visible Light Communication Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Stochastic processes","Light emitting diodes","Computational modeling","Wireless communication","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","free-space optical communication","interference suppression","multi-access systems","optical communication","probability","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath fading effect","distribution function","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","VLC networks","thinned homogeneous Poisson point process","signal-to-interference ratio","coverage analysis","multiuser visible light communication networks","mathematical framework","coverage probability analysis","idle probability","access points","underloaded networks","general networks","AP sleep strategy","cochannel interference minimization","energy saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication","light-emitting diode","coverage probability","Poisson point process","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8214975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Multiuser Visible Light Communication Networks","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8214975/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617720","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K008757/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Analysis of Multiuser Visible Light Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-yin-2782694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104186S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8214975","onlineDate":"15 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8214977,"authors":[{"name":"Leitao Huang","affiliation":["College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8960489/8214977/huang-2778099-small.gif","p":["Leitao Huang (SM\u201917) received the B.S. degree in information and computing science from the Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the M.E. degree in applied mathematics.","His current research interests include switched systems, fuzzy control, and adaptive control."]},"firstName":"Leitao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37087240787"},{"name":"Yongming Li","affiliation":["College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8960489/8214977/li-2778099-small.gif","p":["Yongming Li (SM\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics from the Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in transportation information engineering and control from Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China, in 2014.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology.

However, UCNNs include aspects of long and short-term memory, which are characterized by an equation of neural activity as fast part and an equation of neural synaptic modification as a slow part. For close-loop systems of mobile robots with different time-scales UCNNs can be used to represent the violation of kinematic constraints (like neural activity) and generalized coordinates (like synaptic modifications). Furthermore, UCNNs can act as powerful preprocessors of other neural networks with supervised learning because the unsupervised learning part usually has low computational effort. In this way, the overall computational effort will be considerably reduced. The present work uses the mutual interference between neuron and unsupervised learning of an UCNN in order to analyse the local and global asymptotic stability of mobile robots that not exactly satisfying kinematic constraints. To validate the proposed analysis the equilibrium point of UCNN model will be mathematically analysed by using quadratic-type Lyapunov functions and compared with a model based on a fully supervised learning rule. The results shows that the model based on UCNN converges toward a small ball of the origin with a better performance than the model based on a fully supervised learning rule.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215270/","accessionNumber":"17433208","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215270/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis for mobile robots with different time-scales based on unsupervised competitive neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis for mobile robots with different time-scales based on unsupervised competitive neural networks","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1713431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073631S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168942","isNumber":"8215260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168942","xplore-issue":"8215260","articleId":"8215270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":8215297,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz Ricardo T.

In visual approaches, road marking detection consists in detecting pixels of an image that corresponds to a road marking. Recently, most approaches have aimed on detecting lane markings only, and few of them proposed methods to detect other types of road markings. Moreover, most of those approaches are based on local gradient, which provides noisy detections caused by cluttered images. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on a deep Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) with an encoder-decoder architecture for road marking detection and segmentation. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can detect any road marking type in a high level of accuracy, resulting in a smooth segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/SBR-LARS-R.2017.8215297","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168942/8215260/08215297.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Latin American Robotics Symposium (LARS) and 2017 Brazilian Symposium on Robotics (SBR)","publicationTitle":"2017 Latin American Robotics Symposium (LARS) and 2017 Brazilian Symposium on Robotics (SBR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBR-LARS-R.2017.8215297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Employing a fully convolutional neural network for road marking detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Employing a fully convolutional neural network for road marking detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17433213","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215297/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Employing a fully convolutional neural network for road marking detection","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"1719501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105822S","chronDate":"8-11 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168942","isNumber":"8215260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168942","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215260","articleId":"8215297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":8215313,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The Bitcoin Core protocol limits blocks to 1 MB in size. Each block contains at most some 4,000 transactions. Blocks are added to the blockchain on average every 10 minutes, therefore the transaction rate is limited to some 7 transactions per second (TPS). This is much less than the transaction rate offered by competing financial transaction processing systems. The Bitcoin TPS can be increased by increasing the block size and/or by decreasing the block discovery interval. Both of these interventions will increase the end-to-end block transmission delay, which in turn will increase the probability that different participants momentarily record different versions of the blockchain, so that the consensus protocol will discard an increasing number of blocks. The net effect is that the real increase in the TPS is not proportional to the increase (decrease) in the block size (block discovery rate). Our simulation experiments show that large block sizes, if accompanied by large end-to-end block transmission delays, give rise to the frequent appearance of inconsistent blockchain copies, to the detriment of the TPS. We present a simulation analysis of Bitcoin-Next Generation where blocks (keyblocks) stripped of transactions propagate rapidly through the peer-to-peer network. Once a keyblock is mined, only the miner of the keyblock is entitled to broadcast small microblocks of transactions until the next keyblock is mined and another miner is selected to broadcast microblocks. Initial simulation experiments show that Bitcoin-NG can sustain substantially larger transaction rates than Bitcoin Core.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215367","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215367.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increased block size and Bitcoin blockchain dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Increased block size and Bitcoin blockchain dynamics","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215367/","accessionNumber":"17433779","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased block size and Bitcoin blockchain dynamics","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570385333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043446S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8215368,"authors":[{"name":"Nusrat Fatema","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, FKEE, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nusrat","lastName":"Fatema","id":"37085689428"},{"name":"Yong Xiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, FKEE, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37086269895"},{"name":"Iynkaran Natgunanathan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, FKEE, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Iynkaran","lastName":"Natgunanathan","id":"37395204300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6796-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6797-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"}],"articleNumber":"8215368","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Uplink","Massive MIMO","Minimization","Antennas","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","channel estimation","independent component analysis","MIMO communication","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiblind pilot decontamination method","massive MIMO","multicell multiuser massive multiinput multioutput systems","semiblind channel estimation method","blind pilot decontamination method","generalized robust independent component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","pilot contamination","channel estimation","robust ica"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a semi-blind pilot decontamination based method is proposed in [1] for multicell multiuser massive multiinput multioutput (MIMO) systems. In [1], to reduce the effect of the pilot contamination, a semiblind channel estimation method that does not require cell cooperation or statistical information of the channels is proposed. The blind pilot decontamination method in [1] is reformulated as a constrained optimization problem. The constrained minimization problem of the mixing matrix is then carried out by a generalized robust independent component analysis (ICA) based deflation method. The key demerit of the proposed deflation method is that it suffers from error accumulation. In this paper, we investigate semi blind pilot decontamination method in [1] aiming to analyze the role of the deflation technique used in this method. Our analysis reveals that the error accumulation is a major drawback found in this algorithm. Furthermore, the overall performance improves without the deflation method in the semi blind pilot decontamination.

The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the resource allocation components: power control (PC) and bandwidth allocation (BA). Both resources are related and optimized through the weights of the Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduler in a way to meet both the physical layer signal to interference ratio (SIR) and the network layer packet delay (PD) requirements for every class of users.

Edge computing resources can be deployed very close to end users, e.g., attachment points (AP). In such cases, the edge servers are likely to have a relatively smaller computing capacity than servers deeper in the network. This can be partially compensated by the density and scale of deployment of edge servers. To leverage such deployment, it is important to allocate services efficiently at the edge. For example, neighbor edge servers may serve users attached to a distant AP, as long as the network topology, usage, and edge application requirements, e.g., latency, enables it. In this context, user mobility is important. The user session with the edge should be migrated when needed to ensure that a mobile user continues to be served with a proper Quality of Service (QoS), typically linked to latency. In this paper, we study a service instance allocation algorithm focusing on maintaining QoS for end users, using service migration as a tool to achieve this goal. We propose a globally optimum allocation algorithm, derive a practical algorithm from it, and evaluate its use versus a heuristic and a reference algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215372","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215372.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215372","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical service allocation in mobile edge computing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Practical service allocation in mobile edge computing systems","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17448600","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical service allocation in mobile edge computing systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570388791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041091S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215373,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Nishida","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nishida","id":"37086313778"},{"name":"Masahiro Sasabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Sasabe","id":"37681087400"},{"name":"Shoji Kasahara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Kasahara","id":"37086311703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6796-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6797-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"}],"articleNumber":"8215373","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Cascading style sheets","Games","Collaboration","Fading channels","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","radio networks","radio spectrum management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative spectrum sensing","secondary users","primary user","CSS","noncollaborative spectrum sensing","communication opportunity maximization scheme","objective function","miss detection probability","two-PU scenario","PU channel","SU communication opportunity","PU communication detection","multiple PU cognitive radio networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","collaborative spectrum sensing","communication opportunity","group formation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215373","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215373","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","abstract":"In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) must accurately sense the spectrum of primary user (PU) to acquire their own communication opportunities without interfering PU's communication. Collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) among SUs can improve the probability to detect PU's communication, compared to non-collaborative spectrum sensing, where each SU senses signal independently. In this paper, we propose a communication opportunity maximization scheme for CSS in multiple PUs cognitive radio networks. First, we define an objective function that represents SU's communication opportunity and a constraint on miss detection probability. In the proposed scheme, each SU forms a group with other SUs to meet the constraint and maximize its own communication opportunity according to the objective function and the constraint. Through simulation experiments with a two-PU scenario, we show that the proposed scheme can improve the ratio of winning SUs, that can use PU's channel, to the whole SUs, in comparison with the non-collaborative spectrum sensing. We also show that it can quickly increase the overall throughput of winning SUs up to the theoretical upper bound.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing communication opportunity for collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215373/","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing communication opportunity for collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448612","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing communication opportunity for collaborative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570388815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085521S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215378,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Tokunaga","affiliation":["Collage of Engineering Ibaraki University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Tokunaga","id":"37086256075"},{"name":"Hiromasa Habuchi","affiliation":["Collage of Engineering Ibaraki University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Habuchi","id":"37269784300"},{"name":"Yusuke Kozawa","affiliation":["Collage of Engineering Ibaraki University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kozawa","id":"37391642700"},{"name":"Ran Sun","affiliation":["Collage of Engineering Ibaraki University, Japan"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086147463"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6796-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6797-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"}],"articleNumber":"8215378","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive optics","Nonlinear optics","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Nickel","Multiaccess communication","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","m-sequences","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PseudoNoise codes","modified pseudoorthogonal M-sequence sets","biorthogonal code","high density code-shift-keying","dual MPOMs","high-density code","SCDMA capability","optical-wireless channel","synchronous code division multiple access capability"]}],"abstract":"The high density code-shift-keying (CSK) using Pseudo Noise (PN) codes generated by combining modified pseudo orthogonal M-sequence sets (MPOMs) with biorthogonal code has been proposed.

However, the deployment of large numbers of antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains needed at the base stations (BS) in massive MIMO brings challenges of high system complexity and hardware energy consumption. By using Kronecker channel modeling, a simple stochastic MIMO model for a narrowband channel is developed that uses the correlation matrices at the mobile station (MS) and BS. In this paper, two semi-heuristic techniques are proposed for practical antenna selection considering Kronecker channel modeling in a MU-MIMO broadcast system using principal component analysis (PCA). Therefore, the number of RF chains needed in massive MU-MIMO is reduced by removing the antennas that contribute least to the system sum capacity. A precoding technique of Zero Forcing is used and each user is equipped with a single antenna. Our simulation results show that the proposed antenna selection technique performs much better than mean channel gain selection.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215381","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215381.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna selection for massive MIMO Kronecker channel models using non-central principal component analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna selection for massive MIMO Kronecker channel models using non-central principal component analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215381/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448644","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215381/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna selection for massive MIMO Kronecker channel models using non-central principal component analysis","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570389958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066896S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215392,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Hasan","affiliation":["Aalto Universitv., Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Hasan","id":"38273434200"},{"name":"Nazmus S.

Coverage extensions as well as enhanced throughput gain are attractive from the perspective of network operators. While functioning in the macro-overlaid network, relay offers the flexibility of random deployment (nomadic relay) at places where the communication link is congested due to an occasional event (e.g. festival) or in the emergency response scenario. This nomadic relay deployment helps to improve coverage and capacity in targeted areas based on a temporary but immediate demand. However, peak achievable throughput at the access link is limited by the backhaul link rate. The backhaul link become a bottleneck if the aggregated access link throughput exceeds the backhaul link rate. To avoid this bottleneck, it is desirable to identify means to maintain the backhaul link rate above the aggregated access link capacity. To that end, another promising technology is Coordinated Multipoint Transmission/Reception (COMP) where joint transmission from multiple base station or coordinated base stations offer enhanced throughput. In this study, two types of COMP technique namely Dynamic Point Blanking (DPB) and Quantized Co-Phasing (QCP) have been applied at relay backhaul to reduce the impact of the backhaul bottleneck. This study is performed through analyzing two case scenarios such as 3GPP 5\u00d75 building grid model and realistic building layout. Finally, it is shown that Inter-QCP provides the best output in both cases (3GPP and realistic building layout) at the backhaul link and access link.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215392/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448615","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of coordinated multipoint transmission /reception for enhanced backhauling in nomadic relay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of coordinated multipoint transmission /reception for enhanced backhauling in nomadic relay","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570393383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0408S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215398,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Arikawa","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Labs, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Arikawa","id":"37085662855"},{"name":"Takeshi Sakamoto","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Labs, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37069041500"},{"name":"Shunji Kimura","affiliation":["NTT Device Technology Labs, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunji","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37086312689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6796-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6797-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"}],"articleNumber":"8215398","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Acceleration","Processor scheduling","Hardware","Transmitting antennas","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","computational complexity","mobile antennas","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware accelerator","coordinated radioresource scheduling","ultra-high-density distributed antenna systems","user equipment","system throughputs","5G mobile communications systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","resource scheduling","distributed antenna system","hardware acceleration"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel radio-resource scheduler with a hardware accelerator for coordinated scheduling in 5G ultra-high-density distributed antenna systems. In 5G mobile communications systems, the transmission weight and the overall system throughputs for a huge number of possible combinations of antennas and user equipment have to be computed. To accelerate the scheduling, the new scheduler executes the computation using dedicated hardware. Moreover, it reduces the computational complexity. Experimental results show that the scheduler performs the computation 126 times faster than without acceleration. Simulated results reveal that the scheduler is able to find an optimal combination that achieves the higher system throughput even in a system with a large number of antennas and user equipment.

We consider two possible options to deploy the 5G cells. In the first case, the connectivity is provided by means of small cells mounted on top of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the second case, large cells, covering wider portions of territory, are used. In both cases, we assume that the electricity can be sourced also from solar panels and batteries, which are installed on each cell site. We then propose an economic framework that, given the considered scenario and the equipment costs, is able to: i) compute the number of batteries and the solar panels power for each site, ii) estimate the number of cells to ensure coverage and to guarantee the service to the users, and iii) compute the monthly subscription fee to be charged to users, as well as the Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) costs. Our results, obtained over the sampling areas of Frascati (Italy), Benevides (Brazil) and Rotorua (New Zealand), show that the proposed 5G architecture is feasible, i.e., the monthly subscription fee per user can be set less than 10 [\u20ac/month] for Frascati and Rotorua, and less than 2 [\u20ac/month] for Benevides.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215406","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal pricing strategy for 5G in rural areas with unmanned aerial vehicles and large cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal pricing strategy for 5G in rural areas with unmanned aerial vehicles and large cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215406/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17448642","htmlLink":"/document/8215406/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal pricing strategy for 5G in rural areas with unmanned aerial vehicles and large cells","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570397251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058266S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8215417,"authors":[{"name":"Ash Bellett","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Ash","lastName":"Bellett","id":"37086273521"},{"name":"Gayathri Kongara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Gayathri","lastName":"Kongara","id":"37858371100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6796-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6795-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6797-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2474-154X"}],"articleNumber":"8215417","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Ray tracing","Receivers","Relays","Delays","Attenuation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","radio receivers","ray tracing","relay networks (telecommunication)","software radio","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasistatic environments","static environment","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","ray tracing algorithm","channel state information","relay-assisted communication system","relay-assisted wireless systems","relay position optimisation","ray tracing wireless channel model","path loss","software-defined radio measurements","SDR"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a ray tracing approach to optimise the position of a relay in a static environment such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is maximised at the receiver.

When either the transmitter or the receiver is not fixed, the mismatched polarization axes is caused. It significantly degrades the communication performance. To overcome this problem multilevel differential PolSK (MDPolSK) was proposed, in which we perform differential encoding on a pair of successive transmission symbols. Because the decoding process needs two successive symbols and they are affected by independent noises, MDPolSK is sensitive to noises. In this paper, to reduce the noise influence in MDPolSK, we propose a method to estimate the inclined polarization axes. By using the estimation method the symbol error rate (SER) of MDPolSK can approach that of MPolSK, even in the case of the mismatched polarization axes. In addition, we study the intensity fluctuation caused by the atmospheric turbulence channel and show its influence on the SER of MDPolSK. The intensity fluctuation is modeled by the lognormal distribution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multilevel differential polarization shift keying with estimation of inclined polarization axes over atmospheric turbulence channel","publicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215426","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169969/8215343/08215426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multilevel differential polarization shift keying with estimation of inclined polarization axes over atmospheric turbulence channel","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215426/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448648","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multilevel differential polarization shift keying with estimation of inclined polarization axes over atmospheric turbulence channel","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1570398073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138685S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169969","isNumber":"8215343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169969","xplore-issue":"8215343","articleId":"8215426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215439,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Arafat","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Arafat","id":"37409148900"},{"name":"Nazmus S.

The former provides guarantees on theoretical detectability but falls short when the graph is inconsistent with the underlying model. The latter is model-free but fails to provide quality assurance for the detected communities. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework to combine the advantages of these two principles. The presented method, SGC-GEN, not only considers the detection error caused by the corresponding model mismatch to a given graph, but also yields a theoretical guarantee on community detectability by analyzing Spectral Graph Clustering (SGC) under GENerative community models (GCMs). SGC-GEN incorporates the predictability on correct community detection with a measure of community fitness to GCMs. It resembles the formulation of supervised learning problems by enabling various community detection loss functions and model mismatch metrics. We further establish a theoretical condition for correct community detection using the normalized graph Laplacian matrix under a GCM, which provides a novel data-driven loss function for SGC-GEN. In addition, we present an effective algorithm to implement SGC-GEN, and show that the computational complexity of SGC-GEN is comparable to the baseline methods. Our experiments on 18 real-world datasets demonstrate that SGC-GEN possesses superior and robust performance compared to 6 baseline methods under 7 representative clustering metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448785","htmlLink":"/document/8215477/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Spectral Graph Clustering with Generative Community Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Spectral Graph Clustering with Generative Community Models","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10293S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215489,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Hu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086289563"},{"name":"Zidong Yang","affiliation":["Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Zidong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086288153"},{"name":"Yuanchao Shu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Yuanchao","lastName":"Shu","id":"38468452700"},{"name":"Peng Cheng","affiliation":["Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37287113500"},{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215489","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bicycles","Maintenance engineering","Urban areas","Meters","Pollution","Legged locomotion","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bicycles","traffic engineering computing","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven utilization-aware trip advisor","bike-sharing systems","shared bikes","unbalanced bike usage","bicycle utilization","bike check-in","historical data","biased bike usage","bike circulation","bicycle circulation"]}],"abstract":"Rapid development of bike-sharing systems has brought people enormous convenience during the past decade.

The prerequisite for condition-based monitoring in industrial applications is the capability of (1) capturing multiple operational states, (2) managing many similar but different assets, and (3) providing insights into the internal relationship of the variables. To meet these criteria, we propose a multi-task learning approach based on a sparse mixture of sparse Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). Unlike existing fused- and group-lasso-based approaches, each task is represented by a sparse mixture of sparse GGMs, and can handle multi-modalities. We develop a variational inference algorithm combined with a novel sparse mixture weight selection algorithm. To handle issues in the conventional automatic relevance determination (ARD) approach, we propose a new \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n-regularized formulation that has guaranteed sparsity in mixture weights.

In practice, most of recent studies focus on leveraging radar data or satellite images to make predictions. However, there is another scenario where a set of weather features are collected by various sensors at multiple observation sites. The observations of a site are sometimes incomplete but provide important clues for weather prediction at nearby sites, which are not fully exploited in existing work yet. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network model to automatically extract features from the time series measured at observation sites and leverage the correlation between the multiple sites for weather prediction via multi-tasking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use multi-task learning and deep learning techniques to predict short-term rainfall amount based on multi-site features. Specifically, we formulate the learning task as an end-to-end multi-site neural network model which allows to leverage the learned knowledge from one site to other correlated sites, and model the correlations between different sites. Extensive experiments show that the learned site correlations are insightful and the proposed model significantly outperforms a broad set of baseline models including the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts system (ECMWF).","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.49","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215512.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Short-Term Rainfall Prediction Model Using Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215512/","displayDocTitle":"A Short-Term Rainfall Prediction Model Using Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215512/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433891","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Short-Term Rainfall Prediction Model Using Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096661S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8215516,"authors":[{"name":"Sungbok Shin","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungbok","lastName":"Shin","id":"37086291951"},{"name":"Minsuk Choi","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minsuk","lastName":"Choi","id":"37088732064"},{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37088733600"},{"name":"Scott Langevin","affiliation":["Uncharted Software Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Langevin","id":"38572634700"},{"name":"Christopher Bethune","affiliation":["Uncharted Software Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Bethune","id":"37088725493"},{"name":"Philippe Horne","affiliation":["Uncharted Software Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Horne","id":"37088745344"},{"name":"Nathan Kronenfeld","affiliation":["Uncharted Software Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Kronenfeld","id":"37662258100"},{"name":"Ramakrishnan Kannan","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Ramakrishnan","lastName":"Kannan","id":"37085488185"},{"name":"Barry Drake","affiliation":["Georgia Tech.

We propose herein a novel topic modeling approach on text documents with spatio-temporal information (e.g., when and where a document was published) such as location-based social media data to discover prevalent topics or newly emerging events with respect to an area and a time point. We consider a map view composed of regular grids or tiles with each showing topic keywords from documents of the corresponding region. To this end, we present a tilebased spatio-temporally exclusive topic modeling approach called STExNMF, based on a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique. STExNMF mainly works based on the two following stages: (1) first running a standard NMF of each tile to obtain general topics of the tile and (2) running a spatiotemporally exclusive NMF on a weighted residual matrix. These topics likely reveal information on newly emerging events or topics of interest within a region. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using the geo-tagged Twitter data of New York City. We also provide quantitative comparisons in terms of the topic quality, spatio-temporal exclusiveness, topic variation, and qualitative evaluations of our method using several usage scenarios. In addition, we present a fast topic modeling technique of our model by leveraging parallel computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STExNMF: Spatio-Temporally Exclusive Topic Discovery for Anomalous Event Detection","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.53","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215516.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"STExNMF: Spatio-Temporally Exclusive Topic Discovery for Anomalous Event Detection","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215516/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448784","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STExNMF: Spatio-Temporally Exclusive Topic Discovery for Anomalous Event Detection","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107083S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215520,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Wang","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086321382"},{"name":"Vincent W.

In particular, we aim at estimating the probability of an inactive node to be activated next in a cascade. Despite the success of recent deep learning methods for diffusion, we find that they often underexplore the cascade structure. We consider a cascade as not merely a sequence of nodes ordered by their activation time stamps; instead, it has a richer structure indicating the diffusion process over the data graph. As a result, we introduce a new data model, namely diffusion topologies, to fully describe the cascade structure. We find it challenging to model diffusion topologies, which are dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), with the existing neural networks. Therefore, we propose a novel topological recurrent neural network, namely Topo-LSTM, for modeling dynamic DAGs. We customize Topo-LSTM for the diffusion prediction task, and show it improves the state-of-the-art baselines, by 20.1%-56.6% (MAP) relatively, across multiple real-world data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215520/","accessionNumber":"17448778","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215520/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Topological Recurrent Neural Network for Diffusion Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topological Recurrent Neural Network for Diffusion Prediction","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097259S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8215527,"authors":[{"name":"Dingqi Yang","affiliation":["Exascale Infolab, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Dingqi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37900993400"},{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086328622"},{"name":"Laura Rettig","affiliation":["Exascale Infolab, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Rettig","id":"37085667463"},{"name":"Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux","affiliation":["Exascale Infolab, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux","id":"38270685300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215527","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HistoSketch: Fast Similarity-Preserving Sketching of Streaming Histograms with Concept Drift","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215527.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"554","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.64","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Streaming media","Image color analysis","Weight measurement","Buildings","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data streams","HistoSketch","fast similarity-preserving sketching method","streaming histograms","concept drift","histogram similarity","multiple classification tasks","machine learning","fixed-size sketches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Similarity-Preserving Sketching","Histograms","Streaming Data","Concept Drift","Consistent Weighted Sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215527","abstract":"Histogram-based similarity has been widely adopted in many machine learning tasks. However, measuring histogram similarity is a challenging task for streaming data, where the elements of a histogram are observed in a streaming manner. First, the ever-growing cardinality of histogram elements makes any similarity computation inefficient. Second, the concept-drift issue in the data streams also impairs the accurate assessment of the similarity. In this paper, we propose to overcome the above challenges with HistoSketch, a fast similarity-preserving sketching method for streaming histograms with concept drift. Specifically, HistoSketch is designed to incrementally maintain a set of compact and fixed-size sketches of streaming histograms to approximate similarity between the histograms, with the special consideration of gradually forgetting the outdated histogram elements. We evaluate HistoSketch on multiple classification tasks using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) is an inference algorithm widely used for this purpose with various applications including fraud detection, malware detection, web classification, and recommendation. However, previous methods based on LBP have problems in modeling complex structures of attributed networks because they manually and heuristically select the most important parameter, the propagation strength. In this paper, we propose Supervised Belief Propagation (SBP), a scalable and novel inference algorithm which automatically learns the optimal propagation strength by supervised learning. SBP is generally applicable to attributed networks including weighted and signed networks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SBP generalizes previous LBP-based methods and outperforms previous LBP and RWR based methods in real-world networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.69","startPage":"595","endPage":"604","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Belief Propagation: Scalable Supervised Inference on Attributed Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Belief Propagation: Scalable Supervised Inference on Attributed Networks","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215532/","accessionNumber":"17433876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215532/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Belief Propagation: Scalable Supervised Inference on Attributed Networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067262S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8215533,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Florida State University, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086300604"},{"name":"Congying Xia","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Congying","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086299395"},{"name":"Chenwei Zhang","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Chenwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086059286"},{"name":"Limeng Cui","affiliation":["School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Limeng","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085576870"},{"name":"Yanjie Fu","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yanjie","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086295935"},{"name":"Philip S.

In recent years, more and more online application service sites can be represented as massive and complex networks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning algorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into low-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space and enable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network data. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of a sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this paper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging network based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is aligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the problem, a new embedding framework, namely \"Deep alIgned autoencoder based eMbEdding\" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link and attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the multiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the network structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which define various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and attribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as the meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding vectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BL-MNE: Emerging Heterogeneous Social Network Embedding Through Broad Learning with Aligned Autoencoder","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.70","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215533.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"BL-MNE: Emerging Heterogeneous Social Network Embedding Through Broad Learning with Aligned Autoencoder","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215533/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433886","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BL-MNE: Emerging Heterogeneous Social Network Embedding Through Broad Learning with Aligned Autoencoder","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113741S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215543,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ziat","affiliation":["Eco-Mobility Department, Vedecom Institute, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ziat","id":"37086109933"},{"name":"Edouard Delasalles","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universits, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Jussieu, Paris"],"firstName":"Edouard","lastName":"Delasalles","id":"37086304795"},{"name":"Ludovic Denoyer","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universits, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Jussieu, Paris"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Denoyer","id":"37540832900"},{"name":"Patrick Gallinari","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universits, UPMC Univ Paris 06, Jussieu, Paris"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Gallinari","id":"37270911800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2431},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Forecasting","Biological system modeling","Data models","Time series analysis","Computational modeling","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","forecasting theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","statistical analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatio-temporal neural networks","space-time series forecasting","relations discovery","dynamical spatio-temporal model","recurrent neural network","spatial processes","temporal dependencies","spatial dependencies","structured latent dynamical component","latent representations","geo-spatial statistics","car-traffic prediction","relevant spatial relations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215543","abstract":"We introduce a dynamical spatio-temporal model formalized as a recurrent neural network for forecasting time series of spatial processes, i.e. series of observations sharing temporal and spatial dependencies.

We model the generator distribution of the training data by a mixture of k generative neural networks. These are trained together and collectively learn the generator distribution of a dataset. Data is divided into k clusters, using a novel differentially private kernel k-means, then each cluster is given to separate generative neural networks, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines or Variational Autoencoders, which are trained only on their own cluster using differentially private gradient descent.

Experimental results on public music datasets demonstrated that our approach could effectively merge two genres.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.98","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215561.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"822","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Fuse Music Genres with Generative Adversarial Dual Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Fuse Music Genres with Generative Adversarial Dual Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215561/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433870","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215561/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Fuse Music Genres with Generative Adversarial Dual Learning","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072545S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8215568,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant Shiralkar","affiliation":["Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, School of Informatics and Computing"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Shiralkar","id":"37086263991"},{"name":"Alessandro Flammini","affiliation":["Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, School of Informatics and Computing","Network Science Institute Indiana University, Bloomington, USA"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Flammini","id":"38194536300"},{"name":"Filippo Menczer","affiliation":["Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, School of Informatics and Computing","Network Science Institute Indiana University, Bloomington, USA"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Menczer","id":"37330091500"},{"name":"Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia","affiliation":["Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN, US"],"firstName":"Giovanni Luca","lastName":"Ciampaglia"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215568","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":613},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs to Support Fact Checking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215568","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Semantics","Companies","Writing","Computational modeling","Dogs","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","graph theory","information retrieval","Internet","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge graph","fact checking","massive misinformation spread","human fact checker","background information","flow network","computational fact","knowledge stream","network-flow model","useful patterns","surface relevant facts","stream finding","unsupervised network-flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knowledge Stream","Fact Checking","Knowledge Graph","Network Flow","Minimum Cost Maximum Flow"]}],"abstract":"The volume of information generated online makes it impossible to manually fact-check all claims. Computational approaches for fact checking may be the key to help mitigate the risks of massive misinformation spread. Such approaches can be designed to not only be scalable and effective at assessing veracity of dubious claims, but also to boost a human fact checker's productivity by surfacing relevant facts and patterns to aid their analysis. We present a novel, unsupervised network-flow based approach to determine the truthfulness of a statement of fact expressed in the form of a triple. We view a knowledge graph of background information about real-world entities as a flow network, and show that computational fact checking then amounts to finding a \"knowledge stream\" connecting the subject and object of the triple. Evaluation on a range of real-world and hand-crafted datasets of facts reveals that this network-flow model can be very effective in discerning true statements from false ones, outperforming existing algorithms on many test cases. Moreover, the model is expressive in its ability to automatically discover several useful patterns and surface relevant facts that may help a human fact checker.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.105","startPage":"859","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215568.pdf","endPage":"864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215568/","displayDocTitle":"Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs to Support Fact Checking","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215568/","accessionNumber":"17448833","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs to Support Fact Checking","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060895S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8215570,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyang Gao","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA"],"firstName":"Hongyang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086316623"},{"name":"Shuiwang Ji","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA"],"firstName":"Shuiwang","lastName":"Ji","id":"37532650800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215570","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Training","Image segmentation","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","image segmentation","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel rotation","convolutional layers","feature maps","invariance properties","convolutional neural networks","raw input data","image recognition applications","dense prediction tasks","feature extraction","flip invariance","resource requirement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215570","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks have shown great success on feature extraction from raw input data such as images. Although convolutional neural networks are invariant to translations on the inputs, they are not invariant to other transformations, including rotation and flip. Recent attempts have been made to incorporate more invariance in image recognition applications, but they are not applicable to dense prediction tasks, such as image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a set of methods based on kernel rotation and flip to enable rotation and flip invariance in convolutional neural networks. The kernel rotation can be achieved on kernels of 3 \u00d7 3, while kernel flip can be applied on kernels of any size. By rotating in eight or four angles, the convolutional layers could produce the corresponding number of feature maps based on eight or four different kernels. By using flip, the convolution layer can produce three feature maps. By combining produced feature maps using maxout, the resource requirement could be significantly reduced while still retain the invariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve various invariance at reasonable resource requirements in terms of both memory and time.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.107","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215570.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Dense Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Dense Prediction","htmlLink":"/document/8215570/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433888","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Dense Prediction","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083674S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215586,"authors":[{"name":"Guixiang Ma","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Guixiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086321207"},{"name":"Chun-Ta Lu","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Chun-Ta","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085992864"},{"name":"Lifang He","affiliation":["Department of Healthcare Policy and Research, Cornell University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Lifang","lastName":"He","id":"37086186033"},{"name":"Philip S.

Both graph embedding and hub detection relate to the node clustering structure of graphs. The multi-view graph embedding usually implies the node clustering structure of the graph based on the multiple views, while hubs are the boundary-spanning nodes across different node clusters in the graph and thus may potentially influence the clustering structure of the graph. However, none of the existing works considered joint learning the multi-view embeddings and the hubs from multi-view graph data. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the hub detection task into the multi-view graph embedding framework so that the two tasks could benefit from each other. Specifically, we propose an auto-weighted framework of Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection (MVGE-HD) for brain network analysis. The MVGE-HD framework learns a unified graph embedding across all the views while reducing the potential influence of the hubs on blurring the boundaries between node clusters in the graph, thus leading to a clear and discriminative node clustering structure for the graph. We apply MVGE-HD on two real multi-view brain network datasets (i.e., HIV and Bipolar). The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in brain network analysis for clinical investigation and application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433895","htmlLink":"/document/8215586/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection for Brain Network Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection for Brain Network Analysis","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835a967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070639S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215588,"authors":[{"name":"Fady Medhat","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York, York, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Fady","lastName":"Medhat","id":"38547429200"},{"name":"David Chesmore","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York, York, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Chesmore","id":"38563198500"},{"name":"John Robinson","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York, York, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Robinson","id":"37273857600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3835-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3834-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2449-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"8215588","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Spectrogram","Hidden Markov models","Biological neural networks","Time-frequency analysis","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","music","neural nets","signal classification","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sound recognition","CLNN","MCLNN","multidimensional temporal signal recognition","masking operation","network susceptibility","recognition task","convolutional neural networks","neural network based architectures","masked conditional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Restricted Boltzmann Machine","RBM","Conditional RBM","CRBM","Deep Belief Net","DBN","Conditional Neural Network","CLNN","Masked Conditional Neural Network","MCLNN","Music Information Retrieval","MIR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215588","abstract":"Neural network based architectures used for sound recognition are usually adapted from other application domains such as image recognition, which may not harness the time-frequency representation of a signal.

The CLNN is trained over a window of frames to preserve the inter-frame relation, and the MCLNN enforces a systematic sparseness over the network's links that mimics a filterbank-like behavior. The masking operation induces the network to learn in frequency bands, which decreases the network susceptibility to frequency-shifts in time-frequency representations. Additionally, the mask allows an exploration of a range of feature combinations concurrently analogous to the manual handcrafting of the optimum collection of features for a recognition task.

Although existing methods use sampling techniques without considering temporal dependencies in edges, we observe temporal locality in real dynamic graphs. That is, future edges are more likely to form triangles with recent edges than with older edges. In this work, we propose a single-pass streaming algorithm called Waiting-Room Sampling (WRS) for global and local triangle counting. WRS exploits the temporal locality by always storing the most recent edges, which future edges are more likely to form triangles with, in the waiting room, while it uses reservoir sampling for the remaining edges. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that WRS is: (a) Fast and 'any time': runs in linear time, always maintaining and updating estimates while new edges arrive, (b) Effective: yields up to 47% smaller estimation error than its best competitors, and (c) Theoretically sound: gives unbiased estimates with small variances under the temporal locality.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2017.143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2017.143","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1092","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211002/8215462/08215606.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WRS: Waiting Room Sampling for Accurate Triangle Counting in Real Graph Streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"WRS: Waiting Room Sampling for Accurate Triangle Counting in Real Graph Streams","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215606/","accessionNumber":"17448834","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215606/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WRS: Waiting Room Sampling for Accurate Triangle Counting in Real Graph Streams","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3835b087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065688S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211002","isNumber":"8215462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211002","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8215462","articleId":"8215606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8215650,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxue Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Internship at Uber Technologies, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"],"firstName":"Lingxue","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086315425"},{"name":"Nikolay Laptev","affiliation":["Uber Technologies, San Francisco, California"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Laptev","id":"37645962500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215650","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2754},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Neural networks","Estimation","Bayes methods","Anomaly detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","neural nets","time series","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic time series forecasting","real-time anomaly detection","classical time series models","end-to-end Bayesian deep model","time series prediction","large-scale time series","Uber","reliable uncertainty estimation","Long Short Term Memory networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian neural networks","predictive uncertainty","time series","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Reliable uncertainty estimation for time series prediction is critical in many fields, including physics, biology, and manufacturing.

However, most existing Arctic vegetation maps are at a coarse resolution and with a varying degree of detail and accuracy. Remote sensing-based approaches for mapping vegetation, while promising, are challenging in high latitude environments due to frequent cloud cover, polar darkness, and limited availability of high-resolution remote sensing datasets (e.g., ~ 5 m). This study proposes a new remote sensing based multi-sensor data fusion approach for developing high-resolution maps of vegetation in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We focus detailed analysis and validation study around the Kougarok river, located in the central Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We seek to evaluate the integration of hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, radar, and terrain datasets using unsupervised and supervised classification techniques over a ~343.72 km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n area for generating vegetation classifications at a variety of resolutions (5 m and 12.5 m). We fist applied a quantitative goodness-of-fit method, called Mapcurves, that shows the degree of spatial concordance between the public coarse resolution maps and k-means clustering values and relabels the k values based on the best overlap. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for developing high resolution vegetation maps for our study region in Arctic. We compare two CNN approaches: (1) breaking up the images into small patches (e.g., 6 \u00d7 6) and predict the vegetation class for entire patch and (2) semantic segmentation and predict the vegetation class for every pixel. We also perform accuracy assessments of the developed data products and evaluate varying CNN architectures. The fusion of hyperspectral and optical datasets performed the best, with accuracy values increased from 0.64 to 0.96-0.97 when using a training map produced by unsupervised clustering and Mapcurves labeling for both CNN models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vegetation mapping","Remote sensing","Arctic","Earth","Biological system modeling","Artificial

With the development of online health services, online health communities generate huge amount of valuable medical Question-Answering data, where user intention can be mined. However, the queries posted by common users have many domain concepts and colloquial expressions, which make the understanding of user intents very difficult. In this paper, we try to find and predict user intent from the realistic medical text queries. A CNN-LSTM attention model is proposed to predict user intents, and an unsupervised clustering method is applied to mine user intent taxonomy. The CNN-LSTM attention model has a CNN encoders and a Bi-LSTM attention encoder. The two encoder can capture both of global semantic expression and local phrase-level information from an original medical text query, which helps the intent prediction. We also utilize extra knowledge like part-of-speech tags and named entity tags to enrich feature information. Based on the experiments on a health community query intent(HCQI) dataset, we compare our model with baseline models and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An CNN-LSTM Attention Approach to Understanding User Query Intent from Online Health Communities","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.62","startPage":"430","endPage":"437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.62","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215694.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An CNN-LSTM Attention Approach to Understanding User Query Intent from Online Health Communities","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215694/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448934","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An CNN-LSTM Attention Approach to Understanding User Query Intent from Online Health Communities","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800a430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076023S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8215727,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, American University, Washington, D.C., USA"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086307170"},{"name":"Nathalie Japkowicz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, American University, Washington, D.C., USA"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Japkowicz","id":"37561699700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215727","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Computer security","Anomaly detection","Spatial databases","Geology","Metadata","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data structures","meta data","security of data","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meta-Morisita Index","spatio-temporal marks","meta-data representation","tracking log","spatial point pattern analysis method","anomaly behaviour detection","spatio-temporal data analysis","cyber data","large-scale tracking data analysis","meta-data analysis","cyber security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Mining","Cyber Security","Point Pattern","Morisita Index"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a work flow for processing and analysing large-scale tracking data with spatio-temporal marks that uses an infrastructure for machine learning methods based on a meta-data representation of point patterns.

Most security practitioners in enterprises rely on correlation rules to detect potential threats. While the rules are intuitive to design, each rule is independently defined per log source, unable to collectively address heterogeneity of data from a myriad of enterprise networking and security logs. Furthermore, correlation rules do not look for data events beyond a short time range. To complement the conventional correlation rules-based system, we propose a user activity anomaly detection method. The method first addresses data heterogeneity of multi-source logs by designing a meta data extraction step for event normalization. It then builds user-specific models to flag alerts for users whose currently observed event patterns are sufficiently different from their own patterns in the past.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.110","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","startPage":"797","endPage":"803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous User Activity Detection in Enterprise Multi-source Logs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous User Activity Detection in Enterprise Multi-source Logs","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215742/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448987","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215742/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous User Activity Detection in Enterprise Multi-source Logs","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800a797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043543S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215744,"authors":[{"name":"Qiao Kang","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086317266"},{"name":"Wei-Keng Liao","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Wei-Keng","lastName":"Liao","id":"37273521500"},{"name":"Ankit Agrawal","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37654489500"},{"name":"Alok Choudhary","affiliation":["EECS Department, Northwestern University"],"firstName":"Alok","lastName":"Choudhary","id":"37285106100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215744","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Convergence","Training","Particle swarm optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mean square error methods","particle swarm optimisation","recurrent neural nets","regression analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exploration phase","auto-regressive model","commonly used training method","hybrid recurrent neural network training algorithm","synchronous particle swarm optimization-based preprocessing","temporal error aggregation","time series","local minima","saddle points","parameter settings","activation score","temporal errors","timestamps","real-world datasets","regularized momentum back propagation","adaptive momentum back propagation","mean square error","MSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215744","abstract":"Recurrent neural network has been widely used as auto-regressive model for time series. The most commonly used training method for recurrent neural network is back propagation. However, recurrent neural networks trained with back propagation can get trapped at local minima and saddle points. In these cases, auto-regressive models cannot effectively model time series patterns. In order to address these problems, we propose a hybrid recurrent neural network training algorithm that consists of two phases: exploration and exploitation. Exploration phase uses synchronous particle swarm optimization to search for parameter settings with high activation score and low error. The results of exploration phase are trained with proposed enhanced back propagation, an improved algorithm over traditional back propagation that aggregates temporal errors across timestamps, in exploitation phase. We evaluate our proposed methods using four real-world datasets. Our proposed algorithm, applied to both regularized and adaptive momentum back propagation, increases convergence speed by 10% to 20% and reduces testing mean square error(MSE) at convergence by 5% to 30%. Using particle swarm optimization and activation list in exploration phase, the hybrid training algorithm reduces testing MSEs by more than 30% at convergence compared with traditional back propagation.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.112","startPage":"812","endPage":"817","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215744.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Network Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Preprocessing and Temporal Error Aggregation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215744/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Network Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Preprocessing and Temporal Error Aggregation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215744/","accessionNumber":"17448883","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Training Algorithm for Recurrent Neural Network Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Preprocessing and Temporal Error Aggregation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800a812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053385S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215747,"authors":[{"name":"Dzung T.

Graph embedding, in which the vertices of a graph are mapped to vectors in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, has gained traction as a basic tool for graph analysis. Here we describe an omnibus embedding in which multiple graphs on the same vertex set are jointly embedded into a single space with a distinct representation for each graph. We prove a central limit theorem for this omnibus embedding and show that simultaneous embedding into a common space allows comparison of graphs without the need to perform pairwise alignments of graph embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the omnibus embedding improves upon existing methods.

For both methods, we first train detectors using a log generated by SWaT operating under normal conditions. Then, we evaluate the performance of both methods using a log generated by SWaT operating under 36 different attack scenarios. We find that our DNN generates fewer false positives than our one-class SVM while our SVM detects slightly more anomalies. Overall, our DNN has a slightly better F measure than our SVM.

Due to the number of issues observed during evaluation of widely used distance-based, statistical-based, and cluster-based anomaly detection techniques, we also present a pattern-based approach for anomaly detection in HVAC time-series data. The usage and number of IoT based HVAC systems are enormously increasing and will have a major share in IoT based household devices in the near future. The operational and usage log of these devices contains different sensor values logged with time, containing normal data points, and long-term anomalies. The state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection are unable to detect these long-term anomalies, which reflect the deteriorating effect of a sensor. The presented approach overcomes this problem by building a knowledge base of long/short -term patterns based on normal data points which keep growing over the time. In addition to the detected anomalies and in contrast to the existing methods, the presented method gives meaningful anomaly score for a number of HVAC systems. We evaluate the presented approach on real operational data, collected over the period of 2.5 years. Evaluation results show that the presented approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 99.4%. Discord detection results of the proposed technique on another dataset from a different domain show the generic and adaptive nature of our technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern-Based Contextual Anomaly Detection in HVAC Systems","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.150","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215784.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pattern-Based Contextual Anomaly Detection in HVAC Systems","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215784/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448905","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern-Based Contextual Anomaly Detection in HVAC Systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800b066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140977S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215786,"authors":[{"name":"Pengyuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, USA"],"firstName":"Pengyuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085681928"},{"name":"Manimaran Govindarasu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, USA"],"firstName":"Manimaran","lastName":"Govindarasu","id":"37396722400"},{"name":"Aditya Ashok","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Lab, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Ashok","id":"37543546000"},{"name":"Siddharth Sridhar","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Lab, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"Siddharth","lastName":"Sridhar","id":"37886952000"},{"name":"David McKinnon","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Lab, Seattle, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"McKinnon","id":"38235742900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215786","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":583},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Frequency control","Automatic generation control","Anomaly detection","Power system stability","Measurement","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","data integrity","frequency control","information retrieval","pattern classification","pattern clustering","peer-to-peer computing","power engineering computing","power generation control","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioral pattern instances offline","frequency control","abnormal generator behavioral patterns","power plant","data integrity attack","generator set points","raw telemetry data","behavior conformity metrics","automatic generation control","power system generation control","data-driven anomaly detection","online spatiotemporal data-driven methodology","cyber attacks detection","power system balancing","peer to peer communication capability","AGC","cyber intrusions","semisupervised K-means clustering","information extraction","multiclass classification","balancing authority","BA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balancing and frequency control","generator behavior pattern","conformity metric","attack detection","cyberphysical security"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an online spatiotemporal data-driven methodology to detect malicious cyber attacks that target power system balancing and frequency control. The anomaly detection, which spots abnormal generator behavioral patterns in real time, is achieved locally at a power plant with peer to peer communication capability. We mainly consider the data integrity attack targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and the malicious manipulation of generator set points via cyber intrusions. Behavior conformity metrics are defined as instance features for generators within the same balancing authority (BA) to extract information out of raw telemetry data. We adopt semi-supervised K-means clustering to group each behavioral pattern instances offline, and anomaly detection carries out multi-class classification cyclically during online application based on the model attained. In general, the number of conformity metrics is much smaller compared to that of raw data features, which highly improves the timing performance of anomaly detection. Our experimental studies with the standard IEEE 39 bus system shows that the proposed methodology provides satisfactory accuracy and efficiency by leveraging the domain-specific knowledge in anomaly detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Anomaly Detection for Power System Generation Control","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.152","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215786.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Anomaly Detection for Power System Generation Control","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8215786/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448930","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Anomaly Detection for Power System Generation Control","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800b082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07577S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215787,"authors":[{"name":"Sahar Behzadi","affiliation":["University Of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Sahar","lastName":"Behzadi","id":"37086299908"},{"name":"Katerina Hlav\u00e1ckov\u00e1-Schindler","affiliation":["University Of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Katerina","lastName":"Hlav\u00e1ckov\u00e1-Schindler","id":"37086295932"},{"name":"Claudia Plant","affiliation":["University Of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Plant","id":"37426700900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215787","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Anomaly detection","Graphical models","Heuristic algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Electronic mail","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["causality","Gaussian processes","security of data","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Granger-Lasso algorithm","L1 penalization algorithm","temporal causality detection","Gaussian time series","incremental heterogeneous time series","Granger-Lasso procedure","dependency anomaly detection","Granger-Lasso approach","graphical Granger causal models","temporal causal dependencies"]}],"abstract":"The special characteristics of time series data, such as their high dimensionality and complex dependencies between variables make the problem of detecting anomalies in time series very challenging. Anomalies and more precisely dependency anomalies ensue from the temporal causal depen-dencies. Furthermore the graphical Granger causal models provide an appropriate environment to capture all the temporal dependencies in Gaussian time series. However many production systems are characterized by a high degree of complex stochastic processes consisting of heterogeneous time series. Considering this situation discovery of dependency anomalies would be more challenging since almost all the current algorithms are dealing with the homogeneous cases. Granger-Lasso algorithm is a well-known L1 penalization algorithm which copes with the temporal causality detection only for Gaussian time series. Inspired by this algorithm and considering the incremental heterogeneous time series generated in many different industries, we propose a modification for Granger-Lasso algorithm in the sense that it would be applicable for a larger class of heterogeneous time series. To introduce this algorithm we are motivated by generalized linear models. Moreover based on the proposed algorithm for discovery temporal dependencies we introduce its application in anomaly detection considering time series followed by distributions from exponential family, e.g. Poisson, binomial or multinomial distribution. The Granger-Lasso procedure is solved by using least square cost function with Lasso penalty for appropriately transformed input time series. The experimental results illustrate the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm on the synthetic and other datasets. We evaluated the proposed method on causality testing on different examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.155","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","startPage":"1090","endPage":"1099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependency Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Time Series: A Granger-Lasso Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dependency Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Time Series: A Granger-Lasso Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8215787/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448850","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8215787/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependency Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Time Series: A Granger-Lasso Approach","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"3800b090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069949S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8211022","isNumber":"8215629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8211022","xplore-issue":"8215629","articleId":"8215787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8215790,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Perez Ibanez","affiliation":["Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, US"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Perez Ibanez","id":"37088334458"},{"name":"Yuzhong Shen","affiliation":["Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuzhong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274462600"},{"name":"Joan Dayanghirang","affiliation":["Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Joan","lastName":"Dayanghirang","id":"37088335195"},{"name":"Jiang Li","affiliation":["Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37538158300"},{"name":"Shengli Wang","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environment, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085892498"},{"name":"Zezhong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environment, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zezhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085577335"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3800-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3801-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"8215790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lung","Computed tomography","Feature extraction","Cancer","Machine learning","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","cloud computing","computerised tomography","content-based retrieval","feature extraction","image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","lung","medical image processing","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online content-based image retrieval","CBIR system","smartphone","dynamic time warping","Euclidean distance measurement","Manhattan distance measurement","deep learning features","Image Database Resource Initiative databases","Lung Image Database Consortium","cloud computing platform","image retrieval system","malignant lung nodules","lung cancer","novice radiologists","online assistance system","pulmonary nodule CT Image retrieval"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8215790","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2017.158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8215629","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8211022/8215629/08215790.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Nodule CT Image Retrieval \u2014 An Online Assistance System for Novice Radiologists","abstract":"Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer originated from malignant lung nodules.

Variety of techniques like engineering (construction of dams and reservoirs) and nonengineering (prior investigation of flash floods) has been advanced to forecast the run offs. An efficient disaster management system requires early predicted recommendations for rescue and announcement of exit routes in heavy runoffs. Sewages are the most complex mixture therefore it is not an easy task to build a model for the estimation of rainfall magnitude and time of non-linear runoffs occurrence. Earth can be regarded as a source of magnetic field known as geomagnetic field having range from 25 pT to 65 pT. This research paper elaborated the investigation of flash floods by observing the magnetic field lines using Tesla or magnetometer. Hourly based reading of magnetometer shows that during the runoffs the geomagnetic field briskly reduced. Results proved that during the run offs geomagnetic radiated by the earth got promptly reduced therefore geomagnetic field can be a yardstick to estimate the flash floods.

It can help a robot move in the building, just as it also can help a visually impaired person who wants to move another floor in the building. Due to vision-based approach, the difference in lighting condition and the complex background are the main obstacles in this research. A hybrid image classification model is presented in this research to overcome all these difficulties. This hybrid model is the combination of histogram of oriented gradients and bag of words models, which later reduces the dimension of image features by using the feature selection algorithm. An artificial neural network has been implemented to get the experimental result by training and testing. In order to get training performance, 1000 training image samples have been used and additional 1000 image samples also been used to get the testing performance. The experimental results of this research indicate that this proposed framework is important for real-time implementation to implement the elevator button and elevator floor number recognition framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICE2T.2017.8215992","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Engineering Technology and Technopreneurship (ICE2T)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International

The microgrid partitioning is tested over a period of one year with hourly sampled data of real household consumption and real distributed generation data. The proposed GA approach is compared with a Tabu Search (TS) method already presented in the scientific literature. Results show that both GA and TS lead to the identification of equivalent microgrids. However, the GA based approach achieves better convergence results allowing for a reliable network partitioning with less CPU effort. Moreover, the histograms of the power unbalances of the microgrids show unimodal and skewed distributions offering an interesting starting point for the appropriate deployment of storage and control systems.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216008","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216008.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach for the identification of microgrids partitioning into distribution networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Genetic algorithms","Production","Sociology","Statistics","Clustering algorithms","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","genetic algorithms","power engineering computing","power system reliability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm approach","distribution network","energy exchange","hourly sampled data","household consumption","distributed generation data","GA approach","Tabu Search method","TS","equivalent microgrids","GA based approach","reliable network partitioning","Genetic Algorithm","microgrid identification","IEEE prototypical network PG & E 69-bus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach for the identification of microgrids partitioning into distribution networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216008/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432734","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm approach for the identification of microgrids partitioning into distribution networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"0021bf014117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068258S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8216059,"authors":[{"name":"Nishanthi Duraisamy","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nishanthi","lastName":"Duraisamy","id":"37086116571"},{"name":"H.

It shows how ampacity of a buried cable is affected by the extent of heat transfer from the cable to the surrounding soil and also by the heterogeneity of the soil and its thermal characteristics. Numerical and finite element model of steady-state thermal analysis and ampacity evaluation are presented in this paper.

Due to high switching speed and large reverse conduction loss of GaN devices, the improper dead time length in a high-frequency ACF converter can lead to severe oscillation and efficiency decrease. This paper presents a high-frequency and high-efficiency ACF converter with an adaptive dual edge dead time modulation which can realize ideal Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) ON for primary GaN FETs and Zero Current Switching (ZCS) for GaN synchronous rectifier. Designed by a high voltage 0.18um BCD process, the controller IC can enable a 65 W (19.5V/3.3A) ACF converter to operate at 1 MHz and automatically adjust the dead-time length under universal input (100VAC-260VAC) as well as wide load condition (0.33A-3.33A). With the proposed adaptive dual edge dead time control, the ACF converter can achieve the maximum efficiency of 94.3% and around 80% efficiency at the worst case.

By establishing common compensation index and proper design, the DC bus voltage can be stabilized with reduced DC bus capacitor, the impact from DC bus voltage fluctuation to the load converter output voltage can be reduced by comparing to the case with ADC method only, and because the VR method shares part of the compensation function, the power volume of DBVC can be decreased accordingly, this might result in higher power density and lower power loss potentially compared to the case with DBVC only.

The primary objective of the proposed inverter is to improve the output voltage quality with reduced number of devices and passive components. The generation of nine levels in the output pole voltage is achieved using only ten switches per phase. Although the similar structure of the inverter is well-suited for seven level operation, by using a suitable modulation technique, nine levels can be generated in the output pole voltage without increasing the active and passive devices. In this proposed inverter, the flying capacitors in the inverter are properly controlled at the required voltage levels using redundant switching states. The performance of the inverter fed induction motor drive is analyzed using simulation results under varying modulation index and load conditions. Vector control is implemented for the speed control of the induction motor and tested under different transient conditions. A new PWM technique is proposed to balance the flying capacitors during common-mode voltage injection so that the inverter can deliver full active power up to modulation index of 1.15.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Modulation","Switches","Voltage control","Topology","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","clamps","induction motor drives","machine vector control","PWM invertors","switching convertors","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive","output voltage quality","output pole voltage","common-mode voltage injection","neutral point clamped voltage source inverter","nine level T-type neutral point voltage source inverter","9L-T-NPC inverter","flying capacitor","redundant switching states","PWM technique","vector control","speed control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["T-type neutral point clamped inverter","flying capacitor","modulation index","vector control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216226","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216226.pdf","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nine level T-type neutral point clamped voltage source inverter for induction motor drive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nine level T-type neutral point clamped voltage source inverter for induction motor drive","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216226/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8216226/","accessionNumber":"17432297","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nine level T-type neutral point clamped voltage source inverter for induction motor drive","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1331bf013374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0642S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8216280,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Teja Arumalla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karantaka, Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Ravi Teja","lastName":"Arumalla","id":"37086331742"},{"name":"Sheron Figarado","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Karantaka, Surathkal, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sheron","lastName":"Figarado","id":"37973620400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216280","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Harmonic distortion","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamps","harmonic distortion","induction motor drives","motor drives","pulse width modulation","PWM invertors","stators","switching convertors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic content","space vector domain","voltage harmonic distortion","conventional dodecagonal scheme","dodecagonal space vector generation scheme","harmonic profile","relatively lower switching frequencies","bus-clamping PWM technique","dodecagonal space vector structure","switching frequency","linear modulation range","PWM schemes","bus-clamping pulse width modulation method","3-phase open-end winding induction motor drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","dodecagonal space vector","bus-clamping","induction motor drive","harmonic distortion factor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216280","abstract":"Obtaining better harmonic profile at relatively lower switching frequencies is one of the key tasks in the present day power electronics world.

In this paper, bus-clamping PWM technique is developed for a dodecagonal space vector structure, which is capable of reducing the switching frequency in the linear modulation range compared to conventional dodecagonal space vector technique. In order to compare the performance of the PWM schemes in terms of harmonic content, analytical expressions are derived based on the notion of stator flux ripple in the space vector domain. The results are verified by simulating and comparing the voltage harmonic distortion of the scheme with conventional dodecagonal scheme in terms of voltage weighted total harmonic distortion (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">WTHD</sub>\n) and current total harmonic distortion (I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">THD</sub>\n).","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216280","startPage":"1651","endPage":"1656","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216280.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bus-clamping pulse width modulation method for a dodecagonal space vector generation scheme for 3-phase open-end winding induction motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A bus-clamping pulse width modulation method for a dodecagonal space vector generation scheme for 3-phase open-end winding induction motor drives","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216280/","accessionNumber":"17447942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216280/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bus-clamping pulse width modulation method for a dodecagonal space vector generation scheme for 3-phase open-end winding induction motor drives","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1651bf030627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053087S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8216301,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086309950"},{"name":"Yunkai Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yunkai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37675040500"},{"name":"Fei Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085466761"},{"name":"Yu Yao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086309498"},{"name":"Zhi Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086310004"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216301","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Switching frequency","Stators","Inductance","Resonant frequency","Damping","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","filters","HVDC power convertors","motor drives","permanent magnet motors","stators","voltage control","voltage-source convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping control","modular multilevel converter","output filter","high-speed PM motor drive","high-speed permanent magnet motors","high speed direct-drive applications","high-power density","low stator inductance","current ripple","MMC","voltage level","high equivalent switching frequency","motor stator","HSPMM drive","stator current control method","high order harmonics elimination","iron loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modular multilevel converter","high-speed permanent magnet motor","LC filter","active damping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216301","abstract":"High-speed permanent magnet motors (HSPMMs) have gained ever-increasing interests in high speed direct-drive applications due to their advantages of high-power density, small size and high efficiency. However, the low stator inductance of the HSPMM causes large current ripple in the stator current, therefore brings additional iron loss. The Modular multilevel converter (MMC) increases both voltage level and equivalent switching frequency, which help reducing current ripple. However, the high equivalent switching frequency of the MMC produces high order harmonics. These harmonics will also cause significant iron loss in both the motor stator and the rotor. In this paper, a MMC with output filter for HSPMM drive is proposed. The design method of output filter, as well as the stator current control method are presented. The proposed circuit, and its performance on high order harmonics elimination is verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216301","startPage":"1777","endPage":"1782","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216301.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping control of modular multilevel converter with output filter for high-speed PM motor drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Active damping control of modular multilevel converter with output filter for high-speed PM motor drive","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216301/","accessionNumber":"17432185","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216301/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping control of modular multilevel converter with output filter for high-speed PM motor drive","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"1777bf040185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059258S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8216305,"authors":[{"name":"Valerii Abramenko","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"firstName":"Valerii","lastName":"Abramenko","id":"37086317607"},{"name":"Ilya Petrov","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Petrov","id":"38546788200"},{"name":"Juha Pyrh\u00f6nen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeenranta, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Pyrh\u00f6nen","id":"37275781800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216305","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Harmonic analysis","Steady-state","Aluminum","Reluctance motors","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","magnetic flux","reluctance motors","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stator current linkage distortion","induction motor","damper winding designs","DOL applications","magnetic wedges","slot opening","short pitching","induced rotor Joule losses","DW bars","permeance harmonics","DW currents","SynRM","direct-on-line synchronous reluctance motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct-on-line","Line-start","Synchronous Reluctance Motor","high efficiency","damper winding","slot harmonics","space harmonics","aluminium reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216305","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216305.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of damper winding designs for direct-on-line synchronous reluctance motor","abstract":"One of the essential parts of a Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SynRM) for direct-on-line (DOL) applications is a damper winding (DW) which makes the start of the motor possible.

However, when the winding inductances of 3-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) are realized as line inductors for battery charging, due to machine saliency, the magnetic fields produced by the sinusoidal AC supply results in 1) asymmetrical voltages in the air-gap as a function of rotor position and 2) relatively high magnitudes of oscillating torques causing harmful noise and vibrations. This can lead to significant AC losses with risk of permanent magnet demagnetization in the machine. Since the same motor is employed for traction application as well, it is of significance to optimally design the machine for IC operation. Thus, this paper exclusively investigates three IPMSM rotor configurations to be employed for IC operation in EV. This paper firstly presents a conventional dq-axis circuit model based damper design approach implemented for mitigating the saliency effect during IC. Then, a comparative performance analysis of the rotor configurations with damper bars during IC operation on machine saliency; asymmetrical voltage waveforms; oscillating electromagnetic torque; permanent magnet operating point and magnet losses is performed using finite-element analysis (FEA).

The proposed algorithm is different from the conventional ILC as we are not considering a repetitive control task in this work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216338","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216338.pdf","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2013","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-sample iterative learning control for induction motor drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Inter-sample iterative learning control for induction motor drives","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8216338/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432803","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216338/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-sample iterative learning control for induction motor drives","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2008bf014176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058439S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8216403,"authors":[{"name":"Huaiyuan Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Huaiyuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086274886"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085806303"},{"name":"Xuemei Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37400822300"},{"name":"Zigao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zigao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086220015"},{"name":"Dianguo Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Dianguo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278438500"},{"name":"Qiang Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37287311700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216403","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Impedance","Admittance","Power harmonic filters","Power system stability","Stability analysis","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","digital control","distributed power generation","electric impedance","feedback","high-pass filters","power convertors","power generation control","power grids","power harmonic filters","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping control","weak grid","system stability","stability analysis","grid-connected converter system","passive damping","nonpassive region","output admittance","harmonic resonance mechanism","distributed generations","high-pass filter","digital control delay compensation","second harmonic elimination","Matlab/Simulink simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["harmonic resonance","passive damping","active damping","delay compensation","harmonic elimination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216403","abstract":"Grid-connected converters have been widely used in distributed generations.

Active damping is also widely applied to improve system stability. This paper derives the impedance model of grid-connected converter system and analyzes the harmonic resonance mechanism. The effects of passive damping and active damping are also compared, especially their influence on non-passive region. Impact of capacitor current feedback gain on the output admittance is also analyzed. High-pass filter is used to compensate the digital control delay and reduce the non-passive region of output admittance. An improved active damping is proposed to eliminate second harmonic introduced by active damping. The performance of proposed method is verified in Matlab/Simulink simulations.

To control the novel topology, the so-called modified \u03b4 control utilized for the single-phase electric springs is extended to the three-phase case. Thanks to these solutions, TPES exhibits a behavior entirely different from the existing ones. For instance, under a fluctuation of the line voltages, it exhibits a change of the voltages across NCL that has the same trend as the line voltages. Moreover, it regulates the voltages across the three-phase critical load even under both imbalanced and distorted grid conditions.

The intermittency of PV power output has drawn serious concern when the system is connected to electricity networks. The energy storage system (ESS) is considered as the most promising solution to balance and smooth the PV generation. Consequently, power ramp-rate control (PRRC) has been introduced to avoid significant PV power fluctuations. However, the high cost of ESS is still hindering its extensive application. Therefore, an effective ESS control strategy is demanding to comply with the regulations whilst minimize the ESS power and energy capacity. In this paper, an innovative ESS control strategy is presented, which utilizes the short-term forecasting. The solution activates the ESS system just before the actual cloud shading occurs. It requires only one-quarter of the energy capacity of the conventional ESS control strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified through simulation by using the real PV output power data of a 1 MW system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8216445/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432756","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power ramp-rate control based on power forecasting for PV grid-tied systems with minimum energy storage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power ramp-rate control based on power forecasting for PV grid-tied systems with minimum energy storage","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2647bf012637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064705S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8216497,"authors":[{"name":"Yawu Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yawu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085789333"},{"name":"Xuzhi Lai","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xuzhi","lastName":"Lai","id":"37410598900"},{"name":"Haoqiang Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Haoqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086270925"},{"name":"Pan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086141967"},{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086269972"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216497","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Servomotors","Zirconium","Couplings","Angular velocity","Trajectory tracking","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","finite element analysis","fuzzy systems","manipulators","servomechanisms","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single link manipulator system","finite element model","planar Pendubot","active link","passive link","tracking error","trajectory tracking control strategy","finite element method","planar three-link underactuated manipulator","servo controller","COMSOL"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a trajectory tracking control strategy based on the finite element method for a planar three-link underactuated manipulator with a passive third joint. From the mechanical structure, the manipulator can be thought of as composed of two parts. The first part is the first link of the manipulator, which is a single link manipulator system. The second part consists of the remaining two links, which can be seen as a plananr Pendubot. First, a finite element model of the planar Pendubot is built by using COMSOL, and the coupling relationship between its active link and its passive link is analyzed. Then, two servo controllers (A and B) with the same structure are designed for two active links of the manipulator, respectively. The servo controller A is directly applied to control the angular velocity of the first link of the manipulator rotating with a constant speed, which makes the end-point of the manipulator move along the trajectory direction. Next, a fuzzy system is designed based on the coupling relationship of the planar Pendubot to calculate the target angular velocity of the second link of the manipulator according to the tracking error and its change rate. The servo controller B is applied to control the angular velocity of the second link of the manipulator, which makes the tracking error converge to zero. Finally, Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216497","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216497.pdf","startPage":"2943","endPage":"2948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trajectory tracking control strategy based on finite element method for planar three-link underactuated manipulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216497/","displayDocTitle":"A trajectory tracking control strategy based on finite element method for planar three-link underactuated manipulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432139","htmlLink":"/document/8216497/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trajectory tracking control strategy based on finite element method for planar three-link underactuated manipulator","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2943bf015423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061696S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8216532,"authors":[{"name":"Yulin Si","affiliation":["Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, P.R.

The NREL FASTv8 code and OC3-Hywind 5MW floating wind turbine baseline model are used to verify this proposed data-driven FDI design.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216532","startPage":"3149","endPage":"3154","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216532.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven approach for fault detection of offshore wind turbines using random forests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven approach for fault detection of offshore wind turbines using random forests","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216532/","accessionNumber":"17432713","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216532/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven approach for fault detection of offshore wind turbines using random forests","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3149bf044016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063179S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8216539,"authors":[{"name":"Bai-Qing Fan","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bai-Qing","lastName":"Fan","id":"38489606900"},{"name":"Xiao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086056834"},{"name":"Bo Tian","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085826813"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory on Aircraft Control Technology, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37083736400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216539","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Torque","Vehicle dynamics","Interference","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace components","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","fault tolerant control","force control","gears","mobile robots","nonlinear control systems","observers","steering systems","torque control","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant control","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV control framework","force loop","torque loop","nonlinear disturbance observer","dynamic inverse control","control law design","wing damage","DI control","extended state observer","ESO","steering gear","thrust vector","high maneuver flight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle","nonlinear disturbance observer","extended state observer","dynamic inverse","control allocation"]}],"abstract":"The flight of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is vulnerable to various disturbances and faults.

In order to further reduce the computation cost, Lebesgue sampling based EKF (LS-EKF) is developed, which is able to eliminate unnecessary computations. In this paper, the SOC is estimated by the proposed LS-EKF method based on an equivalent circuit model. By this means, the SOC estimation is much faster than traditional EKF method, which makes it feasible for online applications. This method is verified by SOC experimental results.

SHM consists of the processing and interpretation of the acquired data of a structure in order to evaluate its condition. An accurate early damage detection is an important task in SHM, as a reduction of both required time and repairing costs can be achieved. One of the most common damage scenarios that is present in many civil structures is corrosion. It has been shown that a damage condition changes the vibration response of the structure. For this reason, a methodology based on the discrete wavelet transform and fractal dimension, capable of performing an efficient diagnosis of a structure condition using its vibration response, is presented. The proposed methodology is divided in two main steps, where the first one employs the discrete version of the wavelet transform to denoise and decompose the acquired signal; finally, in step 2, it is executed two different algorithms (Box Dimension and Katz) to obtain the fractal dimension (FD) value of decomposed signal, which is used for detection and quantification of damage into structure. The obtained results show that the proposed DWT-FD methodology is efficient for monitoring the structure condition, which is validated using the measured data of a five-bay truss structure under different levels of corrosion damage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform-fractal dimension-based methodology for damage assessment in truss type structures","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216549","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216549.pdf","startPage":"3251","endPage":"3256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform-fractal dimension-based methodology for damage assessment in truss type structures","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216549/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432204","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform-fractal dimension-based methodology for damage assessment in truss type structures","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3251bf020052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.272776S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8216564,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (Group)CO., LTD., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086281003"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216564","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Data preprocessing","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical mapping operator","PTSP weight matrix","Polymorphic Traveling Salesman Problem","scan field route optimization","determined state","determined loop","genetic algorithm","search process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["polymorphic","PTSP","redistrict","hierarchical mapping","weighted select"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216564","abstract":"In this paper, a new type of TSP, i.e. PTSP (Polymorphic Traveling Salesman Problem) is proposed. The problem is discovered from the research of scan field route optimization. As for PTSP, every node is polymorphic, which means each node can have several states, but obtains only a determined state in a determined loop, moreover a path which connects a pair of nodes can be different and have different distances when either of the node is in a different state in this pair of nodes. Aiming at the particularity of PTSP, hierarchical mapping operator is proposed. By reasonable partition, PTSP weight matrix can be translated to TSP weight matrix formally. A combination of hierarchical mapping operator with classical TSP algorithms is a valid way to solve PTSP. To optimize the search process of GA(genetic algorithm), the select operator of GA is improved. In this paper, a combination of hierarchical mapping operator with improved genetic algorithm is used. Finally, four types of select operators are compared to evaluate their convergent results and performances.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216564","startPage":"3333","endPage":"3339","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216564.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving a new type of TSP using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216564/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving a new type of TSP using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8216564/","accessionNumber":"17432094","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving a new type of TSP using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3333bf006688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060164S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8216602,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Alexandre Kacou","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS, France","Valeo Siemens eAutomotive, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Marc Alexandre","lastName":"Kacou","id":"37085496522"},{"name":"Fakhreddine Ghaffari","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Fakhreddine","lastName":"Ghaffari","id":"37564959200"},{"name":"Olivier Romain","affiliation":["ETIS, CNRS, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Romain","id":"38332154000"},{"name":"Bruno Condamin","affiliation":["Valeo Siemens eAutomotive, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Condamin","id":"37085842888"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216602","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA static timing analysis enhancement based on real operating conditions","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216602.pdf","startPage":"3556","endPage":"3561","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216602","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Temperature measurement","Voltage measurement","Delays","Temperature dependence","Tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA static timing analysis enhancement","timing errors","static timing analysis tools","optimal recommended operating conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Static Timing Analysis","Operating conditions","Voltage","Temperature","Runtime Error","Automotive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216602","abstract":"FPGAs are very sensitive to their operating conditions which can induce runtime errors. To prevent timing errors, FPGA manufacturers propose static timing analysis tools to ensure that the application to be implemented in the FPGA will work correctly at the expected frequency. However, that static timing analysis is corner-based and is thus valid for a set of optimal or recommended operating conditions. In the same time, the real operating conditions can be outside these corners when the FPGA is used in a harsh environment. In this paper, we propose a static timing analysis enhancement technique based on the real operating conditions that the FPGA will encounter. Thus, the static timing analysis can be done outside the predefined corners to ensure that the FPGA application will execute correctly in the real operating conditions. We also present some results showing the accuracy of our method and its application to an automotive application intended to be deployed in an aggressive environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216602/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17432191","htmlLink":"/document/8216602/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA static timing analysis enhancement based on real operating conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA static timing analysis enhancement based on real operating conditions","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3556bf039772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055448S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8216615,"authors":[{"name":"Afagh Mohagheghi","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Afagh","lastName":"Mohagheghi","id":"37074606400"},{"name":"Mehrdad Moallem","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Systems Engineering, Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Moallem","id":"37273917000"},{"name":"Alireza Khayatian","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Khayatian","id":"37372037200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216615","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216615","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Light emitting diodes","Sensors","Lighting control","Stability analysis","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","light emitting diodes","lighting","lighting control","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network-based control method","unknown system model parameters","uncertain system model parameters","daylight disturbance","unknown system model matrix","online neural network method","learning controller","control commands","illuminance levels","desired control system set-point","room model","neural network-based LED lighting control","LED full power level"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8216615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based LED lighting control with modeling uncertainty and daylight disturbance","startPage":"3627","endPage":"3632","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08216615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8216615","abstract":"This paper presents a neural network-based control method for achieving desired lighting levels in an LED-based lighting system with unknown or uncertain system model parameters in the presence of daylight disturbances. Assuming an unknown system model matrix, the control strategy utilizes an online neural network method to synthesize a learning controller. The control commands are dimming levels, which represent the percentage of LED's full power level and the outputs are illuminance levels at target points. The neural controller is designed using a Lyapunov-based analysis to achieve boundedness of the output error to an arbitrarily small ultimate bound. By considering the daylight as a disturbance, it serves as a bias for the desired control system set-point resulting in lower dimming command inputs and energy savings. The controller design only requires the tracking of error signal as input which eliminates the need for any prior knowledge of the daylight disturbance and room model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8216615/","accessionNumber":"17432079","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based LED lighting control with modeling uncertainty and daylight disturbance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based LED lighting control with modeling uncertainty and daylight disturbance","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3627bf025437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15212S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8216659,"authors":[{"name":"Doudou Hu","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Doudou","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086035131"},{"name":"Bo Zhou","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37437008500"},{"name":"Liwei Shi","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Liwei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085804496"},{"name":"Xingwei Zhou","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086035600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216659","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Torque","Stator windings","Copper","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant control","machine control","permanent magnet motors","power convertors","stators","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal current amplitude range","fault tolerant control","four-phase doubly salient electromagnetic motor","fault-tolerant operation","optimal fault-tolerant current amplitude range","four-phase full-bridge converter","bilateral switch","fault-tolerant drive system","faulty phase","excitation torque","optimal FTCA range","four-phase 24/18-pole doubly salient electro-magnetic motor","output torque ripple","stator copper loss","one phase open-circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault tolerant control","four-phase DSEM","output torque ripple","stator copper loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216659","abstract":"The influences of current amplitudes on four-phase 24/18-pole doubly salient electro-magnetic motor(DSEM) under fault-tolerant operation are studied in this paper.

A four-phase full-bridge converter with two bilateral switches is applied to the fault-tolerant drive system. Once the fault of one phase open-circuit occurs, the bilateral switch connected to the faulty phase is switched on and the FTCA of the remaining three phases are adjusted to obtain the same excitation torque as that of normal operation. And the stator copper loss is analyzed as well. The relationship of average output torque, output torque ripple and FTCA are validated through co-simulations of Maxwell and Simplorer.

Wavelet transform is a widely used series arc fault identification method. However, it is difficult to distinguish the normal condition and arc fault when only using wavelet transform, and a large amount of redundant data will be generated. To solve this problem, this paper presents a new series arc fault identification method which based on wavelet transform and singular value decomposition. The experiment platform was built according to UL1699, and the method was verified by experiments. The method presented in this paper can well distinguish the series arc fault and normal state.

Thus, in this paper, the influence of internal current loop on transient response performance of I-V droop controlled paralleled dc-dc converters is analyzed, which is guided and significant for its industry application. The model which is used for dynamic analysis is built, and the root locus method is used based on the model to analyze the dynamic response of the system by shifting different control parameters. Analysis results show that any converter's inner current loop can influence all converters' dynamic responses in the system and the one with larger Virtual Resistance (VR) has greater effect. Increasing the proportional terms can decrease the fluctuations of current and voltage, and key parts of errors can be reduced more rapidly during dynamical process, but adverse effect on completely eliminating errors can be caused; increasing integral terms can enlarge current fluctuations during dynamical process, but the errors can be eliminated more rapidly. The experiments are performed to verify the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8216860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8216860/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17448001","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The influence of internal current loop on transient response performance of I-V droop controlled paralleled DC-DC converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of internal current loop on transient response performance of I-V droop controlled paralleled DC-DC converters","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4982bf037184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094444S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8216860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":8216863,"authors":[{"name":"Guanda Lu","affiliation":["School of Automation Beijing Institute of Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanda","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086311291"},{"name":"Congzhe Gao","affiliation":["School of Automation Beijing Institute of Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Congzhe","lastName":"Gao","id":"38231216500"},{"name":"Xingyu Li","affiliation":["School of Automation Beijing Institute of Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086312540"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8216863","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8216863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Capacitors","Voltage control","Topology","Inverters","Snubbers","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","insulated gate bipolar transistors","invertors","snubbers","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage self-balance performance","voltage self-balance method","clamping diodes","voltage level","high-voltage power converters","collector-emitter voltages","series connected IGBT circuit","clamping diode","snubber capacitor","series connected IGBT","three-phase inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["series connected IGBTs","clamping diode","voltage balance"]}],"abstract":"Series connected IGBTs provide a useful method to improve the voltage level, and which is a very important approach to achieve high-voltage power converters.

Based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, sufficient conditions for quasi-consensus in heterogeneous leader-following multiagent systems are established.

However, not Bitcoin but the underlying technology blockchain offers the possibility to innovatively change industries. The decentralized structure of the blockchain is particularly suitable for implementing control and business processes in microgrids, using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This paper provides a state of the art survey overview of current blockchain technology based projects with the potential to revolutionize microgrids and provides a first attempt to technically characterize different start-up approaches. The most promising use case from the microgrid perspective is peer-to-peer trading, where energy is exchanged and traded locally between consumers and prosumers. An application concept for distributed PV generation is provided in this promising area.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8217069","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08217069.pdf","startPage":"6153","endPage":"6158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8217069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blockchain applications in microgrids an overview of current projects and concepts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Blockchain applications in microgrids an overview of current projects and concepts","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217069/","accessionNumber":"17432539","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blockchain applications in microgrids an overview of current projects and concepts","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"6153bf059668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070514S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8217069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8217119,"authors":[{"name":"He Zhu","affiliation":["School Automation Beijing Information science & Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086295088"},{"name":"Jiuhe Wang","affiliation":["School Automation Beijing Information science & Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiuhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086293935"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217119","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","High definition video"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active disturbance rejection control","control system synthesis","damping","electric current control","nonlinear control systems","PI control","power convertors","power generation control","power supply quality","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passivity based control","dissipation model","unified power quality controller","modular multilevel converter","passivity based controller","current inner loop","nonlinear active disturbance rejection control","circulating current controller","PI control","strong disturbance rejection ability","five-level MMC-UPQC","control strategy","Matlab-simulink","ADRC","virtual damping","global stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMC-UPQC","PCHD model","passivity based controller","ADRC","circulating current"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217119","abstract":"In this paper, the port controlled hamiltonian with dissipation (PCHD) model of unified power quality controller based on modular multilevel converter (MMC-UPQC) under dq0 frame of reference is established. Based on the model and passivity of MMC-UPQC, the passivity based controller is designed by injecting virtual damping in current inner loop, which can accelerate the convergence of error storage function and ensure the global stability of MMC-UPQC. To improve the disturbance rejection ability, the nonlinear active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is employed in voltage outer loop to provide desired current for inner loop. A circulating current controller based on ADRC is designed, which can effectively reduce switching losses. Compared with PI control, the proposed control has advantages such as good dynamic and static performance and strong disturbance rejection ability. The simulation results of five-level MMC-UPQC in Matlab/simulink validate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8217119","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08217119.pdf","startPage":"6425","endPage":"6430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8217119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on passivity based control and active disturbance rejection control for MMC-UPQC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on passivity based control and active disturbance rejection control for MMC-UPQC","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17432350","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217119/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217119/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on passivity based control and active disturbance rejection control for MMC-UPQC","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"6425bf011177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042843S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8217119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8217152,"authors":[{"name":"Battu Prakash Reddy","affiliation":["Microsemi India Pvt.

The core of the proposed strategy is just-in-time learning based soft sensor. When sensor fault occurs, the value of soft sensor is adopted as the redundancy instead of the real faulty sensor value. Meanwhile, the influence of the sensor fault can be tolerated. Due to the complexity of mechanism model for nonlinear system, a kind of just-in-time learning method is employed for soft sensor. The indexes will be predicted by just-in-time learning method online. And only historical sample data will be used for prediction. Instead of considering system global model as normal soft-sensor approaches, just-in-time learning methods only consider the approximate system at current time. Thus JITL owns strong capacity of on-line implementation. Two nonlinear systems, a typical numerical one and a benchmark of wastewater treatment system, are employed for experiments. The experiment results verify the accuracy and implementability of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217234/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17496739","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A data driven sensor fault tolerant scheme for nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data driven sensor fault tolerant scheme for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"7055bf051012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072089S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8217234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8217266,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahui Li","affiliation":["Institute of Complex Systems and Advanced Control, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China, 163318"],"firstName":"Jiahui","lastName":"Li","id":"37087109632"},{"name":"Hongli Dong","affiliation":["Institute of Complex Systems and Advanced Control, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China, 163318"],"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Dong","id":"37407513700"},{"name":"Fei Han","affiliation":["Institute of Complex Systems and Advanced Control, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China, 163318"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Han","id":"37070975500"},{"name":"Nan Hou","affiliation":["Institute of Complex Systems and Advanced Control, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, China, 163318"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085822864"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","State estimation","Symmetric matrices","Delay effects","Neurons","Estimation error","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control nonlinearities","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","Markov processes","neurocontrollers","state estimation","stochastic systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","sensor nonlinearities","discrete delays","mode-dependent exponential stability condition","state estimator","state estimation","delayed Markovian jumping","exponential state estimation","error systeme stimation","MJNN","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential state estimation","Markovian jumping","sensor nonlinearity","mode-dependent time delays","disturbance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217266","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the exponential state estimation issue for a class of delayed Markovian jumping neural networks (MJNNs) with sensor nonlinearities and disturbances.

Based on double modulation wave pulse control strategy, a new offset voltage algorithm is proposed. This control strategy can completely eliminate the low-frequency fluctuations in neutral-point potential. The size of neutral-point current is changed by changing the zero-state duty cycle per phase such that the balance of neutral-point potential is achieved. Considering the direction of maximum current, the direction of neutral-point potential fluctuation and the limitation of dynamic critical range, the best compensation is chosen to balance neutral-point potential quickly. The proposed control strategy is verified by the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8217462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8217462","startPage":"8329","endPage":"8333","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08217462.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on balance of neutral-point potential in three level neutral point clamped inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Research on balance of neutral-point potential in three level neutral point clamped inverter","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217462/","accessionNumber":"17431843","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217462/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on balance of neutral-point potential in three level neutral point clamped inverter","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"8329bf003417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062112S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8217462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8217528,"authors":[{"name":"Zhichao Liu","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Zhichao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085793633"},{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computing, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292022100"},{"name":"Keliang Zhou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Keliang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37271501200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217528","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Delays","Frequency control","Discrete Fourier transforms","State feedback","TV","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional delay period","virtual variable sampling method","frequency adaptation","programmable AC power source","frequency tuning","repetitive control scheme","improved RC scheme","frequency fluctuation","DC-AC converter","virtual variable sampling","selective harmonic repetitive control","frequency adaptive discrete Fourier transform","waveform distortion elimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Repetitive control","DC/AC converter","frequency variation","selective harmonics","virtual variable sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217528","abstract":"This paper proposes a frequency adaptive discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based repetitive control (RC) scheme for DC/AC converter. DFT-based RC is an improved RC scheme aiming to eliminate waveform distortion on selected harmonics without influencing the overall system stability. However, the traditional DFT-based RC is insufficient to accommodate frequency fluctuation as fractional delay period in one signal cycle will lead to the large magnitude pulse deviates away from the desired frequency. To address the problem, virtual variable sampling method is proposed to develop a flexible and precise way to achieve a fixed integer delay with virtual variable sampling. By applying this method, the DFT-based RC can easily accomplish frequency adaptation. Comparing the traditional DFT-based RC, it not only reduces computation load but also increases the system stability. A complete series of experiments of programmable AC power source under frequency tuning are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2017.8217528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2017.8217528","startPage":"8697","endPage":"8702","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168197/8216002/08217528.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8216002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual variable sampling discrete fourier transform based selective harmonic repetitive control of DC/AC converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Virtual variable sampling discrete fourier transform based selective harmonic repetitive control of DC/AC converters","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217528/","accessionNumber":"17448065","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217528/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual variable sampling discrete fourier transform based selective harmonic repetitive control of DC/AC converters","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"8697bf033731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077567S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168197","isNumber":"8216002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168197","xplore-issue":"8216002","articleId":"8217528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8217532,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiming Lv","affiliation":["School of Control Sciences and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, PR China"],"firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085731694"},{"name":"Jun Zhao","affiliation":["School of Control Sciences and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, PR China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537640000"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Control Sciences and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, PR China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280461100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1126-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217532","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217532","abstract":"A multi-objective particle swarm algorithm based on the active learning (MOPSAL) approach is proposed that combines a Multi-Objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with an Pareto Active Learning (PAL) approach.

A novel controller design method based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) through time-domain performance feedback is proposed, where a simulation model is required rather than a mathematical one. On this basis, the second order controller for DAB is designed to improve the dynamic performance and robustness of the system output, and the optimal TPS control scheme based on BP neural network is also developed to minimize current stress and achieve full soft switching of DAB in the whole load range. The efficiency of the converter increased accordingly compared with the conventional single-phase-shift control.

However, there exists some concerns about the EMDs because it fuses the cluttered posterior density as a whole, which contains plenty of components of little physical significance. Thus, it becomes intractable and computation expensive especially when targets are closely spaced or heavy clutters are distributed in the vicinity of targets. To address this problem, in this paper, a EMDs-based fusion algorithm with amplitude information is proposed. Considering the amplitude of target returns is stronger than that coming from false alarm, and the amplitude from each target is distinctly different, here, the amplitude information is utilized to identify targets and clutters. We implement this approach using Gaussian Mixture techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness and high estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm over the EMDs algorithm and traditional Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Sensors","Radar tracking","Information filters","Signal to noise ratio","Clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mixture models","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal distributed fusion technique","cluttered posterior density","fusion algorithm","amplitude information","Gaussian Mixture techniques","EMDs algorithm","Exponential Mixture Densities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed fusion","amplitude information","target tracking","Covariance Intersection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCAIS.2017.8217560","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169625/8217552/08217560.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAIS.2017.8217560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMDs with amplitude information for distributed fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EMDs with amplitude information for distributed fusion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217560/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217560/","accessionNumber":"17433739","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2017-Nov. 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMDs with amplitude information for distributed fusion","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"p117yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051498S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169625","isNumber":"8217552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169625","xplore-issue":"8217552","articleId":"8217560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8217562,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghong Liu","affiliation":["Information Science Academy, Electronic Technology Group Corporation, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanghong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086221980"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37086019803"},{"name":"Wei Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yi","id":"37671280000"},{"name":"Lijiang Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lijiang","lastName":"Kong","id":"37529595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3114-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3113-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3115-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-7896"}],"articleNumber":"8217562","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Optimization","Bayes methods","Automation","Monte Carlo methods","Data integration","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling","particle swarm optimisation","probability","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate optimal chernoff fusion method","importance sampling","decentralized data fusion problem","dynamic sensor networks","Chernoff rule","fused probability density functions","iterative fusion","multisensor cases","multisensor Chernoff fusion","fusion exponent","particle swarm optimization method","high-order optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized data fusion","Chernoff fusion","importance sampling","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217562","abstract":"This paper focuses on addressing the decentralized data fusion (DDF) problem in dynamic sensor networks based on Chernoff rule.

To address these issues, a novel importance sampling (IS) based Chernoff fusion method is proposed. In particular, by considering the multi-sensor cases, the two sensor Chernoff fusion is generalized to a multi-sensor Chernoff fusion, and the accompanying high-order optimization problem for calculating fusion exponent is addressed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Additionally, to ensure accurate approximation of the Chernoff fusion pdf, an IS based procedure is incorporated, wherein the Chernoff fusion is no longer achieved by fusing (Gaussian or Gaussian mixture) parameters of the local sensors but particle samples that obtained from IS.

In this work, we propose a deep learning method, mixture feature embedding convolutional neural network (MfeCNN), to convert the data mapping to a multiple classification problem. Multi-modal features were extracted from different semantic space with a medical NLP package and powerful feature embeddings were generated by MfeCNN. Classes as many as ten were classified simultaneously by a fully-connected soft-max layer based on multi-view embedding. Experimental results show that our proposed MfeCNN achieved best results than traditional state-of-the-art machine learning models and also much better results than the convolutional neural network of only using bag-of-words as inputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433546","htmlLink":"/document/8217680/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mapping client messages to a unified data model with mixture feature embedding convolutional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping client messages to a unified data model with mixture feature embedding convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0072B284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082929S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217695,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086079057"},{"name":"Changlong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Changlong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085370072"},{"name":"Hang Zhuang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37085354075"},{"name":"Jiali Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086076640"},{"name":"Qingfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37072120300"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086173336"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085340896"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217695","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetics","Diseases","Cloud computing","Sparks","Distributed databases","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cluster computing","data handling","decision support systems","genetics","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed gene clinical decision support system","GCDSS","data processing","distributed read mapping algorithm","CloudBWA","batch processing strategy","Apache Spark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gene Clinical Decision Support System","Cloud computing","Spark","Alluxio","Genetic data analysis","Read mapping"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217695","abstract":"The clinical decision support system can effectively solve the limitations of doctors' knowledge, reduce misdiagnosis and help enhance health.

Antibacterial peptides have the possibility to form a new class of antibiotics to aid in combating bacterial antibiotic resistance. Most machine learning methodologies applied to the task of identifying antimicrobial peptides have applied features representing the presence or absence of certain periodic patterns in the amino acid sequence. This requires considering different periodicities for each feature and leads to a large number of features many of which are likely irrelevant to the classification task at hand. Also as the peptides vary in length it is difficult to develop a feature vector of identical finite length representing all the sequences. An easy way to circumvent both of these problems is provided by recurrent neural networks. In this work we choose to extract a feature vector through the application of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks from features representing individual amino acids within each sequence. The LSTM network recursively iterates along both directions of each amino acid sequence and extracts two finite vectors whose concatenation yields the finite length vector representation of the amino acid sequence. As this is done during the training of the network on the classification task, the representation extracted is more likely to be relevant for distinguishing between the classes. This work demonstrates the LSTM approach to classification of antibacterial peptides and compares it to a Random Forest classifier and a k-nearest neighbor classifier.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217697","startPage":"498","endPage":"502","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine

a given patient in continuum of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum, especially in the continuum between cognitively normal controls (CN) and the prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). As a well-known early symptom, some linguistic complexity changes of language have been associated with the progression of AD. Currently, the investigations of linguistic manifestations of MCI do mostly rely on manual analysis, yet linguistic complexity-based neuropsychological assessment cannot be effectively attained by using manual approaches. Taking advantage of the existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key features in linguistic complexity changes associated with the progression of MCI, this study develops an NLP-oriented computerized neuropsychological assessment to automatically analyze the distinguishing characteristics of data in the MCI group versus those in cognitively normal control (CN) group. By using the transcripts of news conferences from President Ronald Reagan, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower (DE), and President George H. W. Bush (GB), who have no known diagnosis of AD, this study found the significantly different patterns of the linguistic complexity changes between CN and MCI subjects, which can be applied into the diagnosis of MCI.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217706","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","startPage":"543","endPage":"546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computerized neuropsychological assessment in mild cognitive impairment based on natural language processing-oriented feature extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computerized neuropsychological assessment in mild cognitive impairment based on natural language processing-oriented feature extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217706/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17448449","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computerized neuropsychological assessment in mild cognitive impairment based on natural language processing-oriented feature extraction","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0098B620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081768S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217738,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086302964"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086189666"},{"name":"Erik Y.

In this study, we had obtained over 3000 high-quality original mammograms with approval from an institutional review board at the University of Kentucky. Different classifiers based on CNNs were built, and each classifier was evaluated based on its performance relative to truth values generated by histology results from biopsy and two-year negative mammogram follow-up confirmed by expert radiologists. Our results showed that CNN model we had built and optimized via data augmentation and transfer learning have a great potential for automatic breast cancer detection using mammograms.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217738","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217738.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whole mammogram image classification with convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217738/","displayDocTitle":"Whole mammogram image classification with convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217738/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433667","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whole mammogram image classification with convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0130B579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056386S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217746,"authors":[{"name":"Zewen Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zewen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086268416"},{"name":"Adan Lin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Adan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086270490"},{"name":"Xuan Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37401428500"},{"name":"Junhao Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Junhao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086262629"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217746","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Tensile stress","Myocardium","Measurement","Convolution","Neural networks","Active contours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiology","cardiovascular system","diseases","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor voting","segmentation method","active contour model","fully convolution neural network","LV segmentation","myocardium segmentation","Left ventricle segmentation","short-axis MRI","LV structure evaluation","cardiovascular disease treatment","diagnosis","LV epicardium segmentation","LV endocardium segmentation","VGG16","ellipse detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Segmentation","Convolution Neural Network","Active Contour Model","Tensor Voting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217746","abstract":"Left ventricle(LV) segmentation is a prerequisite step of evaluation of LV structure and function, which plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Early and accurate diagnosis of tumor grading is the key for subsequent therapy and treatment. In the past, conventional computer-aided diagnosis relies on handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are usually inaccurate and laborious. Recently, deep neural networks have been developed and applied for tumor segmentation and classification. However, most existing methods consider 3D MRI as a series of 2D images and use a simple modality fusion method via feature concatenation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with gated multimodal unit (GMU) fusion to integrate the information both in three dimensions and in multiple modalities. Specifically, 3D convolutional kernels are directly applied to the whole MRI images, gathering the abnormalities in sagittal, axial and coronal directions. GMU with hidden states is proposed to fuse the information of multiple MRI modalities in both feature and decision level. Based on these, privilege information extracted by GMU fusion model is utilized to train a novel network called distilled-CNN, which significantly improves the performance of classification using single modality. Empirical studies on BRATS datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D CNN with GMU fusion and distilled-CNN to distinguish benign gliomas and malignant gliomas.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217751","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217751.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Glioma grading based on 3D multimodal convolutional neural network and privileged learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433599","htmlLink":"/document/8217751/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Glioma grading based on 3D multimodal convolutional neural network and privileged learning","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0143B550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088433S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217753,"authors":[{"name":"Yujuan Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems"],"firstName":"Yujuan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37086330687"},{"name":"Xu Min","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Min","id":"37086099549"},{"name":"Ning Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086598892"},{"name":"Hu Chen","affiliation":["Bureau of Medical Administration National Health and Family Planning Commission People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086334484"},{"name":"Xiaolei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Xie","id":"38237096300"},{"name":"Haibo Wang","affiliation":["China Standard Medical Information Research Center, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China","Clinical Trial Unit, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086333472"},{"name":"Ting Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085516236"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217753","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":758},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical diagnostic imaging","Ontologies","Hospitals","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","data mining","electronic health records","formal concept analysis","health care","hospitals","neural nets","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patient outcome prediction","convolutional neural networks","multigranularity medical concept embedding","health care","medical informatics","risk prediction","Hospital Quality Monitoring System data","MG-CNN model","medical research","medical hierarchical ontology","biomedical data","t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding","knowledge mining","electronic health records"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electronic health records","multi-granularity embedding","convolutional neural network","hierarchical ontology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217753","abstract":"The large availability of biomedical data brings opportunities and challenges to health care. Representation of medical concepts has been well studied in many applications, such as medical informatics, cohort selection, risk prediction, and health care quality measurement. In this paper, we propose an efficient multichannel convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on multi-granularity embeddings of medical concepts named MG-CNN, to examine the effect of individual patient characteristics including demographic factors and medical comorbidities on total hospital costs and length of stay (LOS) by using the Hospital Quality Monitoring System (HQMS) data. The proposed embedding method leverages prior medical hierarchical ontology and improves the quality of embedding for rare medical concepts. The embedded vectors are further visualized by the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique to demonstrate the effectiveness of grouping related medical concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that our MG-CNN model outperforms traditional regression methods based on the one-hot representation of medical concepts, especially in the outcome prediction tasks for patients with low-frequency medical events. In summary, MG-CNN model is capable of mining potential knowledge from the clinical data and will be broadly applicable in medical research and inform clinical decisions.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217753","startPage":"770","endPage":"777","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217753.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patient outcome prediction via convolutional neural networks based on multi-granularity medical concept embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217753/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Patient outcome prediction via convolutional neural networks based on multi-granularity medical concept embedding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217753/","accessionNumber":"17433580","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patient outcome prediction via convolutional neural networks based on multi-granularity medical concept embedding","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0145B467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080163S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8217759,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuling Suo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qiuling","lastName":"Suo","id":"37086272339"},{"name":"Fenglong Ma","affiliation":["University at Buffalo - The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, US"],"firstName":"Fenglong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086271637"},{"name":"Ye Yuan","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086272955"},{"name":"Mengdi Huai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mengdi","lastName":"Huai","id":"37086270143"},{"name":"Weida Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Weida","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086261865"},{"name":"Aidong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Aidong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086139921"},{"name":"Jing Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086011973"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217759","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Diseases","Convolution","Data models","Training","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electronic health records","health care","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personalized disease prediction","personalized predictive modeling","heterogeneous health data","personalized predictive models","electric health records","patient visit lengths","patient similarity","time fusion CNN framework","patient representations","disease predictions","similarity learning metrics","healthcare","probability distribution"]}],"abstract":"Predicting patients' risk of developing certain diseases is an important research topic in healthcare. Personalized predictive modeling, which focuses on building specific models for individual patients, has shown its advantages on utilizing heterogeneous health data compared to global models trained on the entire population. Personalized predictive models use information from similar patient cohorts, in order to capture the specific characteristics. Accurately identifying and ranking the similarity among patients based on their historical records is a key step in personalized modeling. The electric health records (EHRs), which are irregular sampled and have varied patient visit lengths, cannot be directly used to measure patient similarity due to lack of an appropriate vector representation. In this paper, we build a novel time fusion CNN framework to simultaneously learn patient representations and measure pairwise similarity. Compared to a traditional CNN, our time fusion CNN can learn not only the local temporal relationships but also the contributions from each time interval. Along with the similarity learning process, the output information which is the probability distribution is used to rank similar patients. Utilizing the similarity scores, we perform personalized disease predictions, and compare the effect of different vector representations and similarity learning metrics.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217759","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217759.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalized disease prediction using a CNN-based similarity learning method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217759/","displayDocTitle":"Personalized disease prediction using a CNN-based similarity learning method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217759/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433603","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized disease prediction using a CNN-based similarity learning method","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0151B553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101889S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217773,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086281216"},{"name":"Chongyu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chongyu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085562500"},{"name":"Mehul Motani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","id":"37278670800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217773","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Logic gates","Correlation","Decoding","Encoding","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","feature extraction","medical computing","pattern classification","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatio-temporal autoencoder","STAE","spatial encoding","temporal encoding","UCI Machine Learning Repository","feature learning","unsupervised deep learning","patient data","feature selection","spatio-temporal features","pattern classification","electroencephalogram","data extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217773","abstract":"Modern patient data tends to be large-scale and multi-dimensional, containing both spatial and temporal features.

Ads are claiming e-cigarettes help smokers quit, but most of them contain nicotine, which can cause addiction and harm the developing adolescent brain. Therefore national, state and local health organizations have proposed anti-vaping campaigns to warn the potential risks of e-cigarettes. Since there is not definitive evidence that e-cigarettes cause long-term harm, these campaigns received pro-vapors' fight back, and collected a high volume of opponent messages in social media. Thus when we analyze the feedback of anti-vaping campaigns, it is crucial to partition audience into different clusters according to their attitude. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the \u201cCommunity Detection on Anti-vaping Campaign Audience (CodeVan)\u201d problem and design the Sorento method to solve it. Sorento computes users' intimacy scores based on their social connections, repost relations and content similarities.

When the above two issues need to be considered simultaneously for skewed/imbalanced datasets, practitioners and researchers in machine learning may raise the following question: should feature selection be conducted before or after the resampling methods for combating the skewness of a dataset? While feature selection and class imbalance learning have been widely studied in the literature, little study has jointly investigated them. This paper presents a first empirical study on the performance of the two opposing pipelines for binary imbalance learning, i.e., first feature selection then resampling, or first resampling then feature selection. We carry out the study on 35 publicly available datasets belonging to the biological field, using 9 feature selection methods, 6 resampling approaches for class imbalance learning, and 3 well-known classifiers. Our experiments reveal that, there is no constant winner between the two pipelines, practitioners should test both pipelines in order to derive the best classification model for imbalance learning, in particular, the resampling before feature selection pipeline should not be neglected; but we also show that, the feature selection before resampling pipeline outperforms the other in more cases than not.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217782","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217782.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"938","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection and resampling in class imbalance learning: Which comes first?

Pharmacovigilance tracks and monitors safe use of pharmaceutical products. Pharmacovigilance involves tracking side effects that may be caused by medicines and other health related drugs. Medical professionals have a difficult time collecting this information. It is anticipated that social media could help to collect this data and track side effects. Twitter data can be used for this task given that users post their personal health related experiences on-line. One problem with Twitter data, however, is that it contains a lot of noise. Therefore, an approach is needed to remove the noise.

Recent success of deep learning in computer vision have progressed such research further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG and Inception are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is re-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image entropy to select the most informative slices for training. Through experimentation on the OASIS MRI dataset, we show that with training size almost 10 times smaller than the state-of-the-art, we reach comparable or even better performance than current deep-learning based methods.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217822","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217822.pdf","startPage":"1166","endPage":"1169","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Alzheimer's disease classification through transfer learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards Alzheimer's disease classification through transfer learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17433624","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217822/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Alzheimer's disease classification through transfer learning","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0214S02206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063838S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8217826,"authors":[{"name":"Rashika Mishra","affiliation":["Department of computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Rashika","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37086265218"},{"name":"Ovidiu Daescu","affiliation":["Department of computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Ovidiu","lastName":"Daescu","id":"37281566500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217826","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":756},"abstract":"Melanomas are the most aggressive form of skin cancer.

State-of-the-art imaging modalities, such as electron microscopy, allow researchers to study tissues, cells and sub-cellular organelles at high resolution. Recently, various works address the problem of segmenting mitochondria in electron microscopy images. Manual segmentation of mitochondria is difficult and may not have high accuracy as automatic segmentation can yield. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network approach for automatic segmentation of mitochondria in brain tissue, specifically the CA1 hippocampus region imaged by an focusedion beam scanning electron microscope. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively evaluated. According to our experiments, deep convolutional neural network is a suitable solution for mitochondria segmentation. Results have been compared with previous studies that segment the mitochondria on CA1 Hippocampus Dataset. The proposed deep learning system produces promising results for segmentation of electron microscopy images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433383","htmlLink":"/document/8217827/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy volumes using deep convolutional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy volumes using deep convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0219B493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124136S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217830,"authors":[{"name":"Haipeng Wan","affiliation":["School of Software, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haipeng","lastName":"Wan","id":"37086282406"},{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["School of Software, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086276821"},{"name":"Hong Song","affiliation":["School of Software, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117000"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["School of Optics and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086284041"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217830","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dorsal hand vein recognition based on convolutional neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217830","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Veins","Feature extraction","Convolution","Histograms","Training","Neural networks","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image filtering","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","regression analysis","smoothing methods","vein recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region of interest","contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization","CLAHE","Gaussian smoothing filter algorithm","Reference-CaffeNet","AlexNet","VGG depth CNN models","logistic regression","ensemble learning","SqueezeNet","dorsal hand vein images","dorsal hand vein recognition rate","dataset size","dorsal hand vein recognition method","convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dorsal hand vein recognition","deep learning","convolutional neural network","ensemble learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a dorsal hand vein recognition method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), compared the recognition rate of different depth CNN models and analyzed the influence of dataset size on dorsal hand vein recognition rate.

Automatic chemical-induced disease extraction is usually recognized as a classification task, and several systems have been proposed for this task recently due to some annotated corpora publicly available. Most of the systems are based on machine learning methods with many manually-crafted features. In recent years, deep learning that does not only can avoid verbose feature engineering but also shows competitive performance has been widely used in various types of tasks, including classification task. Therefore, deep learning has great potential on chemical-induced disease extraction. In this paper, we proposed an architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention mechanism for chemical-induced disease extraction, which does not only avoid verbose feature engineering but also integrates domain knowledge in a simple way. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based chemical-induced disease extraction system is competitive with other state-of-the-art systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217843/","accessionNumber":"17433404","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8217843/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chemical-induced disease extraction via convolutional neural networks with attention","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chemical-induced disease extraction via convolutional neural networks with attention","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0235B230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056335S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8217907,"authors":[{"name":"Gozde Yolcu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Gozde","lastName":"Yolcu","id":"37086262562"},{"name":"Ismail Oztel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Oztel","id":"37086272646"},{"name":"Serap Kazan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Serap","lastName":"Kazan","id":"38084195800"},{"name":"Cemil Oz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Cemil","lastName":"Oz","id":"38233924300"},{"name":"Kannappan Palaniappan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Kannappan","lastName":"Palaniappan","id":"37297109700"},{"name":"Teresa E.

Impaired facial expression is a common sign of numerous medical conditions, particularly neurological disorders. Accurate automated systems are needed to recognize facial expressions and to reveal valuable information that can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach for automatic facial expression recognition. The proposed architecture first segments the facial components known to be important for facial expression recognition and forms an iconized image; then performs facial expression classification using the obtained iconized facial components image combined with the raw facial images. This approach integrates local part-based features with holistic facial information for robust facial expression recognition. Preliminary experimental results using the proposed system achieved 93.43% facial expression recognition accuracy, more than 6% accuracy improvement compared to facial expression recognition from raw input images. The goal of the proposed study is design of a noninvasive, objective, and quantitative facial expression recognition system to assist diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders affecting facial expressions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17433392","htmlLink":"/document/8217907/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning-based facial expression recognition for monitoring neurological disorders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning-based facial expression recognition for monitoring neurological disorders","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0299S10207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158362S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8217933,"authors":[{"name":"Ika Novita Dewi","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Communication and Computer Network, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ika Novita","lastName":"Dewi","id":"38655858200"},{"name":"Shoubin Dong","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Communication and Computer Network, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Shoubin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37306779000"},{"name":"Jinlong Hu","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Communication and Computer Network, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086312856"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3050-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3051-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8217933","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drug-drug interaction relation extraction with deep convolutional neural networks","abstract":"Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) relation extraction is a multi-class classification problem that aims to predict the interaction between drugs in a sentence. The configuration of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in relation extraction usually applied shallow architecture layers, which may make the information in given input text is not fully captured, thus fail to capture a long sentence containing the detected drug relation or some irrelevant word captured during the feature extraction process. This paper proposed an extending depth of the CNN layer called DeepCNN for DDI relation extraction. The DeepCNN learns the high quality of the learning representation so that it is able to cover long input sentences as the typical of DDIExtraction dataset. We use multi-channel word-embedding to enlarge the vocabulary and decrease the number of unknown words, and Adam update rule to automatically learn the network parameters of DeepCNN for DDI relation extraction. The experiments show that the architecture of 10 layers DeepCNN successfully obtained the significant improvement compared to the previous CNN method in DDI relation extraction. The result proves that CNN is a robust and well-deserved for DDI relation extraction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Drugs","Convolution","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drugs","feature extraction","medical computing","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detected drug relation","feature extraction process","DeepCNN","DDI relation extraction","Drug-drug interaction relation extraction","deep convolutional neural networks","multi-class classification problem","relation extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Drug-Drug Interaction","Relation Extraction","Deep Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217933","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217933","startPage":"1795","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217933/","displayDocTitle":"Drug-drug interaction relation extraction with deep convolutional neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17433664","htmlLink":"/document/8217933/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drug-drug interaction relation extraction with deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0325B411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157929S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8217945,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron N.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is one of the most important prognostic indicators for melanoma survival. We present several machine learning models for predicting SLN metastasis using data from a real-world dermatology electronic health record (EHR) system. The class label is the result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, an elective procedure that can be performed for newly-diagnosed melanoma patients to determine if there is metastasis in the nearest lymph node. We show that a simple model, using solely Breslow thickness, can achieve predictive performance (AUC=0.769) comparable to a logistic regression model using 5 features (AUC=0.772, p=0.518). Current clinical recommendations are to perform a biopsy for patients with melanomas thicker than 1mm, however, when applying this 1mm threshold to the simple thickness model, it achieves 0% sensitivity for melanomas <;1mm. Using a random forest model, we achieve 78.9% sensitivity (p<;0.001) for melanomas <;1mm.

The advancing in cloud computing technology and the availability of distributed processing clusters can also provide support to this task. However, data transferring and results' combining, in this case, could be the major bottleneck. The flood of billions of observed mass spectra, hundreds of Gigabytes or potentially Terabytes of data, could easily cause the congestions, increase the risk of failure, poor performance, add more computations' cost, and waste available resources. Therefore, in this study, we propose a deep learning model in order to mitigate the traffic over cloud network and, thus reduce the cost of cloud computing. The model, which depends on the top 50 intensities and their m/z values of each spectrum, removes any spectrum which is predicted not to pass the majority voting of the participated search engines. Our results using three search engines namely: pFind, Comet and X!Tandem, and four different datasets are promising and promote the investment in deep learning to solve such type of Big data problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search engines","Cloud computing","Proteins","Peptides","Machine learning","Databases","Proteomics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","bioinformatics","cloud computing","data analysis","distributed processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","mass spectra","pattern clustering","pattern matching","proteins","proteomics","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSMS spectra reduction","multiple protein search engines","ensemble solutions","distributed processing clusters","data transferring","deep learning model","cloud network","cloud computing","Big data problems","matching algorithms","mass spectra"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Learning","Protein Search Engine","Cloud Computing","Searching Space Reduction","Network Traffic","Data Reduction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217951","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169618/8217602/08217951.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8217602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning-based MSMS spectra reduction in support of running multiple protein search engines on cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8217951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning-based MSMS spectra reduction in support of running multiple protein search engines on cloud","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217951/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217951/","accessionNumber":"17433483","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","pubMedId":"34430067","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning-based MSMS spectra reduction in support of running multiple protein search engines on cloud","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0343S18202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075095S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8217964,"authors":[{"name":"Adam A.

First, we substituted a Morlet-wavelet-based scalogram in place of the commonly used Fourier-based spectrogram. The frequencies in a scalogram are logarithmically scaled, which likely makes it better model a mouse's pitch perception based on the structure of its inner ear. Works that use the linear spectrogram are more likely to overemphasize frequency change at high frequencies, and so might misclassify calls when partitioning them according to frequency modulation. We showed that laboratory mice do indeed modulate their calls more when making high-frequency calls, which we would expect if they perceive pitch logarithmically. Secondly, we used \u201cdeep\u201d convolutional neural networks to automatically identify calls within the scalogram. A convolutional neural network performs much like the animal visual cortex, and has enjoyed recent success in computer-vision and related problems. We compared the convolutional network to a conventional fully-connected neural network and the Song filter used by recent papers, and found that our convolutional network identifies calls with greater precision and recall.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8217964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8217964/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17433693","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning to extract laboratory mouse ultrasonic vocalizations from scalograms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning to extract laboratory mouse ultrasonic vocalizations from scalograms","confLoc":"Kansas City, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"0353S19202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15104S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169618","isNumber":"8217602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169618","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8217602","articleId":"8217964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8218467,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, the roles of these two technologies and how they interact with each other in future vehicular communication systems remain unclear. Understanding the propagation characteristics is an essential step in investigating the benefits and shortcomings of each technology. To this end, we discuss salient properties of radio and visible light propagation channels, including radiation pattern, path loss modeling, noise and interference, and channel time variation. Comparison of these properties provides an important insight that the two communication channels can complement each other's capabilities in terms of coverage and reliability, thus better satisfying the diverse requirements of future cooperative intelligent transportation systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"2634","endPage":"2644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08218751.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Radio Frequency and Visible Light Propagation Channels for Vehicular Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8218751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8218751/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Radio Frequency and Visible Light Propagation Channels for Vehicular Communications","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542738","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006477","fundingName":"National Taiwan University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418","fundingName":"Intel Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002465","fundingName":"Delta Electronics","grantNumber":"MOST 106-2633-E-002-00, 106-2221-E-002-051-MY2 and NTU-ICRP-106R104045"},{"fundingName":"Croatian Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IP-2014-09-3877"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Comparison of Radio Frequency and Visible Light Propagation Channels for Vehicular Communications","sourcePdf":"access-cheng-2784620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103887S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8218751","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8218754,"authors":[{"name":"Do Dung Nguyen","affiliation":["Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8218754/nguye-2784392-small.gif","p":["Do Dung Nguyen received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Transport and Communications, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2009.

Unlike the perfect channel state information (CSI) assumption, the practical minimum mean-squared error-based channel estimation is considered. And the asymptotic signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) analysis of four power-scaling scenarios is presented to show that, even with the imperfect CSI, the interpair interference can still be eliminated, the small-scale fading as well as the noise at source nodes and the relay can be averaged out in the regime of very large number of antenna. It is unveiled that the impact of the channel estimation error will present in the effective large-scale fading coefficient, which explicates the degradation by the imperfect CSI estimate and consumes the results with perfect CSI as special cases. On the basis of the asymptotic SINR analysis results, the optimal power allocation problem is formulated to derive the energy efficient relaying scheme for the maximum ratio combining-maximum ratio transmission precoding scheme. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate that the energy efficient design can effectively reduce the power consumption while maintaining a reasonable sum rate in the multipair two-way massive MIMO relaying system, even in the presence of CSI error.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Energy Efficient Multi-Pair Two-Way Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Imperfect CSI and Optimal Power Allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08218754.pdf","startPage":"2589","endPage":"2603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8218754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8218754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Energy Efficient Multi-Pair Two-Way Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Imperfect CSI and Optimal Power Allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8218754/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542740","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771406"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On the Energy Efficient Multi-Pair Two-Way Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Imperfect CSI and Optimal Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2784392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12757S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8218754","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8218756,"authors":[{"name":"Daryus Chandra","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8218756/chand-2784417-small.gif","p":["Daryus Chandra (S\u201915) received the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia, in 2014.

In this paper, we make fundamental contributions in teletraffic modeling for blocking probability evaluation in NH-OLSs. These are based on the development of the well-known decomposition methodology, which decomposes an NH-OLS into independent subsystems and applies a suitable node model to each subsystem. In particular, we provide new both theoretical and numerical results involving both new and existing approximation methods. We show that these results cover a broad range of NH-OLSs, including those with heterogeneous arrival processes, server group size, and/or routing, with both Poisson and non-Poisson arrivals of fresh requests. Our theoretical results include the first scalable asymptotic exactness results for NH-OLSs. Our new approximations include the first computationally efficient and fairly accurate approximation for NH-OLSs with both mutual overflow and non-Poisson input with asymptotic exactness properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","volume":"66","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17766419","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219364/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blocking Probability Evaluation for Non-Hierarchical Overflow Loss Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blocking Probability Evaluation for Non-Hierarchical Overflow Loss Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chan-2784450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159604S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8219364","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8219366,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Zhu","orcid":"0000-0002-9106-395X","id":"37085631300"},{"name":"Shaowei Liao","affiliation":["CityU Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Liao","id":"37396964300"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-7439-2156","id":"37086081947"},{"name":"Shufang Li","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shufang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-1553-887X","id":"37537870400"},{"name":"Quan Xue","affiliation":["CityU Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Xue","orcid":"0000-0002-4226-2127","id":"37280402500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"8219366","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2560},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Ports (Computers)","Antenna measurements","Aperture antennas","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","aperture antennas","broadband antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antenna arrays","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-port planar aperture antenna","feeding network","dual-CP radiation","dual-CP array","power splitting network","series feeding method","antenna elements","CP radiation array","dual-circularly polarized planar aperture antenna","frequency 55.0 GHz to 66.0 GHz","frequency 54.2 GHz to 64.3 GHz","frequency 54.8 GHz to 65.0 GHz","frequency 60.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual-circular polarization (CP)","millimeter wave (mm-Wave)","planar aperture antenna/array","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)"]}],"abstract":"This communication presents new designs of dual-circularly polarized (CP) planar aperture antenna and array for 60 GHz applications.

avoidance scenario in the presence of a smart interferer, which can rapidly observe the transmit power of a backscatter wireless sensor network (WSN) and effectively interrupt backscatter signals. We consider a power control with a sub-channel allocation to avoid interference attacks and a time-switching ratio for backscattering and RF energy harvesting in backscatter WSNs. We formulate the problem based on a Stackelberg game theory and compute the optimal parameters to maximize a utility function against the smart interference. We propose two algorithms for the utility maximization using Lagrangian dual decomposition for the backscatter WSN and the smart interference to prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms effectively maximize the utility, compared to that of the algorithm based on the Nash game, so as to overcome smart interference in backscatter communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"22","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17683477","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219367/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Game-Theoretic Modeling of Backscatter Wireless Sensor Networks Under Smart Interference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korean government (MSIT)","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007053","fundingName":"Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003052","fundingName":"Korean government (MOTIE)","grantNumber":"20174010201620"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game-Theoretic Modeling of Backscatter Wireless Sensor Networks Under Smart Interference","sourcePdf":"lcomm-kim-2784454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087646S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8334015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8334015","articleId":"8219367","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219369,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Hemant Chincholkar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Satyajit Hemant","lastName":"Chincholkar","orcid":"0000-0002-5926-8488","id":"37085758646"},{"name":"Wentao Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wentao","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0001-6361-0656","id":"37086043974"},{"name":"Chok-You Chan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chok-You","lastName":"Chan","id":"38184445800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8219369","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219369","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Inductors","DC-DC power converters","Stability analysis","Trajectory","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","hysteresis","nonlinear control systems","PI control","stability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding-mode control","closed-loop output voltage response","proportional-integral controller","closed-loop controlled system","nonlinear control","hybrid DC-DC boost converter","PI-based SM controller","hysteresis-modulation-based SM controller","stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC boost converters","sliding mode control","voltage control"]}],"abstract":"Sliding-mode (SM) control is a popular nonlinear control strategy for the dc-dc converters as it offers several advantages such as ease of implementation and robust performance against load and line variations. However, the main drawback of the traditional hysteresis-modulation-based SM controller is that its use in the regulation of the dc-dc converters results in a tradeoff between the overshoot and speed of the closed-loop output voltage response. This is due to the use of the traditional proportional-integral (PI) controller which is used to generate the reference inductor current of the controller. To overcome this problem, the traditional PI-based SM controller is modified such that the reference inductor current used in the sliding surface is now generated using an integral whose integrand is a function of the normalized output voltage error of the converter. A key feature of the integrand is that it is bounded by a user-defined constant. The modified SM control strategy is applied to a hybrid dc-dc boost converter. The expression of the equivalent control signal of the proposed SM controller is derived and the detailed stability analysis of the closed-loop controlled system is given. Also, experimental results are provided to show that the proposed SM controller gives an improved performance as compared to that obtained using the existing PI-based SM controller.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2017.2784549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2017.2784549","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8513902/08219369.pdf","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Hysteresis-Modulation-Based Sliding Mode Control for Improved Performance in Hybrid DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Hysteresis-Modulation-Based Sliding Mode Control for Improved Performance in Hybrid DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","volume":"65","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219369/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18194559","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219369/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Hysteresis-Modulation-Based Sliding Mode Control for Improved Performance in Hybrid DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chincholkar-2784549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064949S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8513902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8513902","articleId":"8219369","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219372,"authors":[{"name":"Junjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8219372/jwang-2784349-small.gif","p":["Junjun Wang (S\u201916) received the B.Eng.

The uniform control strategy unifies different control structures for multifunctional BIC in terms of power management, ac and dc voltage support. With the unified control structure, various triggering mechanisms for BIC mode-switch are not compulsory in response to the relevant scenario changes in the power network. Therefore, the negative consequences, such as unsmooth transition and system collapse due to the inaccurate or slower mode switch, can be avoided. Moreover, the uniform control strategy is also applicable for the hierarchical controlled hybrid microgrid, whose control architecture is typically comprised of the centralized and decentralized levels. This enables the communication fault ride-through capability and the impact from the communication failures can thus be mitigated. To sum up the above two features, the proposed control strategy is able to provide a smooth operation for the BIC without control mode switch in the event of unintentional scenario changes in power or communication network. To verify the validity of the proposed uniform control strategy, the controller hardware-in-the-loop experimental results have been provided in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2784349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8329255/08219372.pdf","startPage":"6188","endPage":"6197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2784349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Uniform Control Strategy for the Interlinking Converter in Hierarchical Controlled Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219372/","displayDocTitle":"A Uniform Control Strategy for the Interlinking Converter in Hierarchical Controlled Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17661107","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219372/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore","grantNumber":"S14-1186-NRFEIRP-IHL"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Uniform Control Strategy for the Interlinking Converter in Hierarchical Controlled Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tie-jin-2784349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09411S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8329255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8329255","articleId":"8219372","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219376,"authors":[{"name":"Vanika Singhal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"p":["Vanika Singhal received the master\u2019s degree from The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, in 2014.

First, to balance the upper or lower two capacitors, a novel flying-capacitor-based voltage balance circuit (VBC) is proposed, and the time-domain average model of the VBC is established. Then a state-machine-based control strategy is developed to balance capacitor voltages as well as to limit overcurrent of inductors in a transition process. To keep the midpoint voltage stable, a zero-sequence injection method is proposed, which inherently ensures the improved modulation signals locate within the linear modulation ranges. With the flying capacitor transferring energy between dc capacitors, the device voltage stresses of the VBC are equalized, and the steady-state current ripples of the inductors are much smaller than those of the conventional chopper-based VBCs, which can reduce the volume and weight of the inductor. Simulation and experimental results for both inverter and rectifier operations prove that the proposed hybrid voltage balance method can balance dc capacitors of five-level DCCs in both steady states and transition states, and the inductor currents of VBCs can also be restricted within safe ranges.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Voltage Balance Method for Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2784399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8329255/08219384.pdf","startPage":"6020","endPage":"6031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2784399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Voltage Balance Method for Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8219384/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17661129","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1200602-20"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Voltage Balance Method for Five-Level Diode-Clamped Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-cui-2784399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173104S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8329255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8329255","articleId":"8219384","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219390,"authors":[{"name":"Kien Nguyen","affiliation":["Image and Video Lab, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8219390/nguye-2784352-small.gif","p":["Kien Nguyen received the Ph.D. degree from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Australia.

The iris image is segmented using two circular contours and then geometrically normalized using a pseudo-polar transformation resulting in a fixed rectangular image. Features are subsequently extracted using several state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf CNNs (AlexNet, VGG, Google Inception, Microsoft ResNet, Facebook DenseNet ), and then classified using an SVM. Our experiments have shown that off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, even though originally trained for the problem of object recognition, can be appropriated to the iris recognition task. By harnessing state-of-the-art CNNs from the ILSVRC challenge and applying them on the iris recognition task, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy in two large iris datasets, viz., ND-CrossSensor-2013 and CASIA-Iris-Thousand. These preliminary results show that off-the-shelf CNN features can be successfully transferred to the iris recognition problem, thereby effectively extracting discriminative visual features in iris images and eliminating the laborious feature-engineering task.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"38KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/8274985/8219390/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2784352.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/8274985/8219390/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2784352.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Machine learning","Computer architecture","Visualization","Computer vision","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","image matching","image representation","image texture","iris recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometric recognition","robust feature descriptor","low computational complexity","computer vision","iris recognition","off-the-shelf CNN features","iris images","iris datasets","iris patterns","iris stroma","ImageNet large scale visual recognition","textural nuances","Gabor wavelets","binary code","phasor response","textural descriptor","false match rates","generic descriptors","deep learning method","convolutional neural networks","complex image characteristics","generic object classification","discriminative visual feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iris recognition","biometrics","deep learning","convolutional neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08219390.pdf","startPage":"18848","endPage":"18855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iris Recognition With Off-the-Shelf CNN Features: A Deep Learning Perspective","abstract":"Iris recognition refers to the automated process of recognizing individuals based on their iris patterns. The seemingly stochastic nature of the iris stroma makes it a distinctive cue for biometric recognition. The textural nuances of an individual's iris pattern can be effectively extracted and encoded by projecting them onto Gabor wavelets and transforming the ensuing phasor response into a binary code - a technique pioneered by Daugman. This textural descriptor has been observed to be a robust feature descriptor with very low false match rates and low computational complexity. However, recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision indicate that generic descriptors extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to represent complex image characteristics. Given the superior performance of CNNs on the ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge and a large number of other computer vision tasks, in this paper, we explore the performance of state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs on iris recognition. We show that the off-the-shelf CNN features, while originally trained for classifying generic objects, are also extremely good at representing iris images, effectively extracting discriminative visual features and achieving promising recognition results on two iris datasets: ND-CrossSensor-2013 and CASIA-IrisThousand. We also discuss the challenges and future research directions in leveraging deep learning methods for the problem of iris recognition.","topic":"Visual Surveillance and Biometrics: Practices, Challenges, and Possibilities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17712811","htmlLink":"/document/8219390/","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Iris Recognition With Off-the-Shelf CNN Features: A Deep Learning Perspective","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Iris Recognition With Off-the-Shelf CNN Features: A Deep Learning Perspective","sourcePdf":"access-nguyen-2784352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094078S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Visual Surveillance and Biometrics: Practices, Challenges, and Possibilities"],"articleId":"8219390","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219391,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyue Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8278888/8219391/zhang-2784414-small.gif","p":["Xinyue Zhang (S\u201916) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Small geometrical details impose a fine mesh and a reduced time step, significantly increasing computational cost. Model order reduction has been proposed as a systematic way to generate compact models for complex objects, by which one can then instantiate into a main FDTD mesh. However, the stability of FDTD with embedded reduced models remains an open problem. We propose a systematic method to generate reduced models for FDTD domains, and embed them into a main FDTD mesh with guaranteed stability up to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limit of the fine mesh. With a simple perturbation technique, the CFL of the whole scheme can be further extended beyond the fine grid's CFL limit. Reduced models can be created for arbitrary domains containing inhomogeneous and lossy materials. Numerical tests confirm the stability of the proposed method and its potential to accelerate multiscale FDTD simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8278888/08219391.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2784414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2784414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stable FDTD Method With Embedded Reduced-Order Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Stability analysis","Power system stability","Numerical stability","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","mesh generation","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable FDTD method","embedded reduced-order models","computational efficiency","finite-difference time-domain method","complex objects","geometrical details","reduced time step","computational cost","model order reduction","main FDTD mesh","embedded reduced models","systematic method","FDTD domains","Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit","arbitrary domains","multiscale FDTD simulations","CFL limit","perturbation technique","lossy materials","inhomogeneous materials","numerical tests"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) limit extension","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","model order reduction (MOR)","passivity","stability","subgridding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Stable FDTD Method With Embedded Reduced-Order Models","volume":"66","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8219391/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17509429","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant Program)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stable FDTD Method With Embedded Reduced-Order Models","sourcePdf":"tap-triverio-2784414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071076S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8278888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8278888","articleId":"8219391","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219394,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad-Hassan Khooban","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8350421/8219394/khoob-2784385-small.gif","p":["Mohammad-Hassan Khooban (M\u201913) was born in Shiraz, Iran, in\n 1988.

Recently, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), which introduce wireless mobile chargers (MCs) to replenish energy for nodes, have been proposed to resolve the root cause of energy limitations in WSNs. However, existing wireless charging algorithms cannot fully leverage the mobility of MCs because unity between the energy replenishment process and mobile data collection has yet to be realized. Thus, in this paper, a joint energy replenishment and data collection algorithm for WRSNs is proposed. In this algorithm, the network is divided into multiple clusters based on a K-means algorithm. Two MCs visit the anchor point in each cluster by moving along the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in opposite directions. The positions of anchor points are calculated by the base station (BS) based on the energy distribution in each cluster. A spare MC is assigned to the network in case either of the two MCs depletes its energy before reaching the BS. After the two MCs' current tours are over, a semi-Markov model is proposed for energy prediction so anchor points can be updated in the next round. Simulation results demonstrate the semi-Markov-based energy prediction model is highly precise, and the proposed algorithm can replenish energy for network energy effectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Energy Replenishment and Data Collection Algorithm in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2784478","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2784478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08219395.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Energy Replenishment and Data Collection Algorithm in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8219395/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18025505","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572172"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016B10714"},{"fundingName":"Changzhou Sciences and Technology Program","grantNumber":"CE20165023 and CE20160014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XYDXXJS-007"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning Fourth Batch of Distinguished Professor Project (2014)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"20170540793"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017B718X14"},{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX17_0538"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009012","fundingName":"Hohai University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Energy Replenishment and Data Collection Algorithm in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-han-2784478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101552S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8219395","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8219396,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Liang Hsu","affiliation":["Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/9016411/8219396/hsu-2781732-small.gif","p":["Yu-Liang Hsu (M'17) received the BS degree in automatic control engineering from the Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2004, and the MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

First, we adopt a musical induction method to induce participants' real emotional states and collect their ECG signals without any deliberate laboratory setting. Afterward, we develop an automatic ECG-based emotion recognition algorithm to recognize human emotions elicited by listening to music. Physiological ECG features extracted from the time-, and frequency-domain, and nonlinear analyses of ECG signals are used to find emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. Subsequently, we develop a sequential forward floating selection-kernel-based class separability-based (SFFS-KBCS-based) feature selection algorithm and utilize the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) to effectively select significant ECG features associated with emotions and to reduce the dimensions of the selected features, respectively. Positive/negative valence, high/low arousal, and four types of emotions (joy, tension, sadness, and peacefulness) are recognized using least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) recognizers. The results show that the correct classification rates for positive/negative valence, high/low arousal, and four types of emotion classification tasks are 82.78, 72.91, and 61.52 percent, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","volume":"11","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"19449438","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2020","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8219396/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic ECG-Based Emotion Recognition in Music Listening","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 106-3011-E-006-002 and MOST 106-2221-E-035-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic ECG-Based Emotion Recognition in Music Listening","sourcePdf":"taffc-wang-2781732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215599S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"9016411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"9016411","articleId":"8219396","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219398,"authors":[{"name":"Ion Vornicu","affiliation":["Instituto de Microelectr\u00f3nica de Sevilla, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientficas-Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8264902/8219398/vorni-2784484-small.gif","p":["Ion Vornicu received the degree in electronics engineering (specialization in microtechnologies) in 2008, the M.Sc. degree in modern signal processing techniques, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics in 2011, all from the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Limited by uncorrelated noise and/or low illumination conditions, image capturing becomes nearly impossible in a single-shot exposure time. Moreover, the depth accuracy is affected by jitter. Therefore, many frames need to be taken to reconstruct the final accurate image. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is based on pixel-wise histogram building. Specifically, a histogram is built on the fly for each pixel of the array from the ongoing acquired frames. This paper presents the design and implementation on FPGA of a real-time pixel-wise inter-frame histogram builder at 1 kfps. The design has been proven with a 64 \u00d7 64-pixels SPAD camera. Its remarkable robustness has been demonstrated in harsh conditions, such as 42 kHz of dark count rate (DCR) and high background illumination up to 20 times larger than the DCR. The system has a graphic user interface for 2D/3D imager configuration, image streaming, and pixel-wise histogram streaming.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2784484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors

antennas with canonical structures (viz., transformation or combination by regular shapes) for wideband radiation and fragment structures (viz., combination by discrete fragment patches) for high isolation is proposed and demonstrated. In the design, multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition combined with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) for optimization of canonical structures and MOEA/D combined with genetic operator (MOEA/D-GO) for optimization of fragment structures are combined and iterated. The design is demonstrated with compact bow-tie MIMO antennas sharing a small common ground plane. The four orthogonally deployed bow-tie antennas are optimized by using MOEA/D-DE to acquire dual polarization and wideband radiation. Fragment-type structures on the common ground plane are optimized by using MOEA/D-GO to acquire very high isolation. Both simulation and measurement show that the optimized MIMO bow-tie antennas provide isolation higher than 30 dB in a relative bandwidth of 40% (from 2.6 to 3.9 GHz). With the proposed design technique, dual-band high-isolation MIMO antennas may also be designed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17613340","htmlLink":"/document/8219404/","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of High-Isolation Wideband Dual-Polarized Compact MIMO Antennas With Multiobjective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671421"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of High-Isolation Wideband Dual-Polarized Compact MIMO Antennas With Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tap-wang-2784446-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087222S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8305571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8305571","articleId":"8219404","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219416,"authors":[{"name":"Khoa Le","affiliation":["ETIS, UMR8051, Universit\u00e9 Paris Seine, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8369410/8219416/le-2777802-small.gif","p":["Khoa Le received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, the Ph.D. degree from the University of Cergy-Pontois, France, in 2017.He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the ETIS Laboratory, ENSEA, France.

However, this outstanding performance is known to come with an augmentation of the decoder complexity, compared to the non-probabilistic gradient descent bit flipping (GDBF), becoming a drawback of this decoder. This paper presents a new approach to implementing PGDBF decoding for quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, based on the so-called variable-node-shift architecture (VNSA). In VNSA-based PGDBF implementations, the regularity of QC-LDPC connection networks is used to cyclically shift the memory of the decoder, leading to the fact that, a variable node (VN) is processed by different computing units during the decoding process. With this modification, the probabilistic effects in VN operations can be produced by implementing different types of processing units, without requirement of a probabilistic signal generator. The VNSA is shown to further improve the decoding performance of the PGDBF, with respect to other hardware implementations reported in the literature, while reducing the complexity below that of the GDBF. The efficiency of the VNSA is proven by ASIC synthesis results and by decoding simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","volume":"65","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"17801690","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219416/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Variable-Node-Shift Based Architecture for Probabilistic Gradient Descent Bit Flipping on QC-LDPC Codes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"French ANR through the NAND Project","grantNumber":"ANR-15-CE25-0006-01"},{"fundingName":"Franco-Romanian (ANR-UEFISCDI) Joint Research Program (DIAMOND Project)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-Node-Shift Based Architecture for Probabilistic Gradient Descent Bit Flipping on QC-LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tcsi-le-2777802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116375S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8219416","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219419,"authors":[{"name":"Xingbin Tu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8219419/tu-2784388-small.gif","p":["Xingbin Tu received the B.S. degree with the College of Ocean and Earth Science, Xiamen University, China, in 2012, and the master\u2019s degree in 2014.

However, the prefix introduces overhead and reduces spectral efficiency. This is especially true in fast time-varying channel conditions. Here, we propose a prefix-free scheme to facilitate frequency-domain equalization (FDE) in an underwater acoustic communication system, based on the time-reversal processing. In the proposed scheme, three main procedures, block partitioning, IBI cancellation, and prefix reconstruction, precede the FDE operation. The block partitioning at the receiver provides flexibility to support channel equalization in different channel fluctuation rates. The utilized prefix reconstruction scheme requires a strong first arrival to minimize the noise enhancement. Our solution is to use the time-reversal processing, because the resultant equivalent impulse response, also known as the q-function, has a stable and compact peak. To further enhance receiver performance, we incorporate two strategies. One is overlapping partitioning. The other is iterative prefix reconstruction. The proposed schemes have been tested using the field measurements obtained from the Gulf of Mexico in August 2016.

In this paper, we introduce the usage of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional networks, for extracting useful representation for heart biometrics recognition. Particularly, we investigate the learning of feature representations for heart biometrics through two sources: on the raw heartbeat signal and on the heartbeat spectrogram. We also introduce heartbeat data augmentation techniques, which are very important to generalization in the context of deep learning approaches.

The input serial streams are deserialized and aligned to a common clock domain for NULL suppression and data packet forwarding.

The research reported in this paper is motivated to improve the utilisation of GPUs by proposing a framework, we refer to as schedGPU, to facilitate intra-node GPU co-scheduling such that a GPU can be safely shared among multiple applications by taking memory constraints into account. Two approaches, namely a client-server and a shared memory approach are explored. However, the shared memory approach is more suitable due to lower overheads when compared to the former approach. Four policies are proposed in schedGPU to handle applications that are waiting to access the GPU, two of which account for priorities. The feasibility of schedGPU is validated on three real-world applications. The key observation is that a performance gain is achieved.

Conventional FLL comprises a notch filter and a frequency adaptive loop. The notch filter can be categorized into two types: real coefficient filter (RCF) and complex coefficient filter (CCF). However, the principles, models, and structures of RCF and CCF are generally explained by various theories, and thus, a unified understanding and further developments of FLLs are restricted. This paper proposes a generalized design framework of FLLs based on the Popov adaptive theory. Grounded on the proposed framework, three main contributions can be achieved: 1) the mathematical equivalence of RCF-based FLLs and CCF-based FLLs are revealed; 2) not only the wellknown FLLs (e.g., the DSOGI-FLL and the AVF-FLL) can be derived, but also the other FLLs with novel features can be generated, and thus, the existing case designs of FLLs are developed into a family of designs; 3) the performance differences in terms of stability and convergence speed of the FLLs are quantitatively analyzed, and thereby an enhanced FLL (referred to as EFLL) is recommended. The designs and analyzes have been verified by both simulations and experiments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8350421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2784413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8350421/08219714.pdf","startPage":"7072","endPage":"7084","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2784413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Design Framework of Notch Filter Based Frequency-Locked Loop for Three-Phase Grid Voltage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Design Framework of Notch Filter Based Frequency-Locked Loop for Three-Phase Grid Voltage","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8219714/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"17736705","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB0900300"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273045, U1510208 and 51361135705"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Design Framework of Notch Filter Based Frequency-Locked Loop for Three-Phase Grid Voltage","sourcePdf":"tie-he-2784413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115964S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8350421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8350421","articleId":"8219714","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":8219715,"authors":[{"name":"Chuntao Wang","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Media Security, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8272400/8219715/wang-2784379-small.gif","p":["Chuntao Wang (M\u201910) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","From 2007 to 2008, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Korea University, South Korea.

Most of these compression schemes in the literature leverage statistical correlation at the content-owner or service-provider side, which would either increase the computational burden on the content-owner or disclose statistical distributions to the service-provider and thus probably hinder their practical applications. Through analysis on properties of the compression system for encrypted data, we believe that it is more preferable to exploit statistical correlation of natural images at the receiver side with both encryption key and sufficient computational capability, which in turn would improve compression efficiency while achieving low computational complexity and sufficient security for the content owner and the service provider. In light of this, we use the Markov random field (MRF) to characterize binary images in the spatial domain and represent it with a factor graph. The constructed MRF representation of the binary image in the factor graph is then integrated seamlessly with the factor graph for low-density parity check (LDPC)-based decompression, yielding a joint factor graph for binary image reconstruction. By deriving message update equations for the joint factor graph, we develop a new lossless compression scheme for encrypted binary images, which involves stream-cipher-based encryption, LDPC-based compression, and factor-graph-based image reconstruction. Preferable parameters for the proposed scheme are first determined numerically on a specific binary image and then applied to other binary images. Extensive simulations show that significant improvements in terms of compression bit rate over the state of the art are achieved, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2784379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2784379","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8272400/08219715.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8272400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Compression of Encrypted Binary Images Using the Markov Random Field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Compression of Encrypted Binary Images Using the Markov Random Field","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17541776","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219715/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772573, U1736215, 61702199, 61672242, U1636206, 61525203, 61472235, 61472146, 61379156 and 61202467"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201707010029"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"2014A030306021"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Program for Special Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals","grantNumber":"2015TQ01X796"},{"fundingName":"Pearl River Nova Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201610010037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Compression of Encrypted Binary Images Using the Markov Random Field","sourcePdf":"tifs-wang-2784379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084025S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8272400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8272400","articleId":"8219715","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219718,"authors":[{"name":"Huifang Min","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8219718/min-2784347-small.gif","p":["Huifang Min received the B.S. degree in information and computing\n science from Zhejiang Ocean University, Zhoushan, China, in 2012 and the M.S. degree in management science and\n engineering from the School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, China, in\n 2015.

As one of the distinctive features, the growth assumptions imposed on system time-delay nonlinearities are removed in this output-feedback case. To handle the unmeasurable states and disturbances, the composite state observer and disturbance observer are constructed simultaneously. Based on these two observers, an output-feedback controller is designed by introducing an auxiliary system to eliminate the effect of input saturation and using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to deal with time delay. It is shown that the designed controller can ensure the closed-loop system to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Particularly, instead of converging to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero as in related results, the tracking error is proven to be bounded by the saturation input error and design parameters that can be explicitly tuned. Finally, a chemical reactor system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2784347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08219718.pdf","startPage":"5856","endPage":"5863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2784347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite-Observer-Based Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Input Saturation and Its Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219718/","displayDocTitle":"Composite-Observer-Based Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Input Saturation and Its Application","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630225","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219718/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC of China","grantNumber":"61673215, 61473151, 61374087, 61573172 and 61703132"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140770"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30916015105"},{"fundingName":"Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT13072"},{"fundingName":"PAPD"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Jiangsu Province"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150034"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0859"},{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation and Practice Innovation","grantNumber":"KYCX17_0364"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite-Observer-Based Output-Feedback Control for Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Input Saturation and Its Application","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2784347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080614S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8219718","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219720,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Xuan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8219720/xuan-2784394-small.gif","p":["Qi Xuan received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and\n engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang\n University, from 2008 to 2010, and a Research Assistant with the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University\n of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, SAR, in 2010 and 2017.

Pearls can be delivered to the detection device one by one, where multiview images of each pearl can be collected. A novel multistream convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) is developed to cope with these multiview images, with each stream processing an image of particular viewing angle and different streams sharing part of weights to fuse high-order features without losing too much diversity. Using the machine, we collect 52 500 multiview images for 10 500 pearls, i.e., each pearl has five images of top, left, right, main, and rear views. These pearls were labeled by the experienced professionals in advance, and grouped into two classes with rough rules and seven classes with fine rules. Experimental results show that, compared with the support vector machine and backpropagation neural network, our MS-CNN behaves much better in both classification tasks, obtaining 92.14% and 91.24% accuracies. Moreover, the visualization of activations of convolutional kernels suggests that MS-CNN, imitating the manual process, can indeed recognize relatively complex features. These results indicate the potential value of our machine in the pearl industry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219720/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17661065","htmlLink":"/document/8219720/","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Pearl Classification Machine Based on a Multistream Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572439 and 61273212"},{"fundingName":"NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization","grantNumber":"U1509212"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Pearl Classification Machine Based on a Multistream Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tie-xuan-2784394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102845S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8329255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8329255","articleId":"8219720","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219722,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Yao","affiliation":["School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8387695/8219722/yao-2784562-small.gif","p":["Lin Yao is an Associate Professor with the School of Software, Dalian\n University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Due to vehicles' mobility, it becomes rather inefficient to establish end-to-end connections in VCCNs. Consequently, content packets are usually sent back to the requesting node via different paths in VCCNs. To improve network performance of VCCNs, node mobility should be exploited for vehicles to serve as relays and to carry data for delivery. In this paper, we propose a scheme called cooperative caching based on mobility prediction (CCMP) for VCCNs. The main idea of CCMP is to cache popular contents at a set of mobile nodes that may visit the same hot spot areas repeatedly. In our CCMP scheme, we use prediction based on partial matching to predict mobile nodes' probability of reaching different hot spot regions based on their past trajectories. Vehicles with longer sojourn time in a hot region can provide more services and should be preferred as caching nodes. To solve the problem of limited buffer at each node, we design a cache replacement based on content popularity to guarantee that only popular contents are cached. We evaluate CCMP through the opportunistic network environment simulator for its salient features in success ratio and content access delay compared to other state-of-the-art schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2784562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8387695/08219722.pdf","startPage":"5435","endPage":"5444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2784562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cooperative Caching Scheme Based on Mobility Prediction in Vehicular Content Centric Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219722/","displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Caching Scheme Based on Mobility Prediction in Vehicular Content Centric Networks","volume":"67","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840051","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219722/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672129 and 61772113"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT16QY41"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1320428"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Caching Scheme Based on Mobility Prediction in Vehicular Content Centric Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-deng-2784562-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094239S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8387695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8387695","articleId":"8219722","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8219724,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Sookhak","affiliation":["Department of System and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Polytechnic School of Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/8334163/8219724/sookh-2784423-small.gif","p":["Mehdi Sookhak received the PhD degree in computer science, major in\n information security, from the University of Malaya (UM), in 2015 where he was an active researcher in Center of\n Mobile Cloud Computing Research (C4MCCR).

Currently, establishments that produce huge volume of sensitive data, leverage data outsourcing to reduce the burden of local data storage and maintenance. The outsourced data, however, in the cloud are not always trustworthy because of the inadequacy of physical control over the data for data owners. To better streamline this issue, scientists have now focused on relieving the security threats by designing remote data checking (RDC) techniques. However, the majority of these techniques are inapplicable to big data storage due to incurring huge computation cost on the user and cloud sides. Such schemes in existence suffer from data dynamicity problem from two sides. First, they are only applicable for static archive data and are not subject to audit the dynamic outsourced data. Second, although, some of the existence methods are able to support dynamic data update, increasing the number of update operations impose high computation and communication cost on the auditor due to maintenance of data structure, i.e., merkle hash tree. This paper presents an efficient RDC method on the basis of algebraic properties of the outsourced files in cloud computing, which inflicts the least computation and communication cost. The main contribution of this paper is to present a new data structure, called Divide and Conquer Table (D&CT), which proficiently supports dynamic data for normal file sizes. Moreover, this data structure empowers our method to be applicable for large-scale data storage with minimum computation cost. The one-way analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences between the proposed method and the existing methods in terms of the computation and communication cost on the auditor and cloud.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2017.2784423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8334163/08219724.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2017.2784423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auditing Big Data Storage in Cloud Computing Using Divide and Conquer Tables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219724/","displayDocTitle":"Auditing Big Data Storage in Cloud Computing Using Divide and Conquer Tables","volume":"29","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17685498","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219724/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auditing Big Data Storage in Cloud Computing Using Divide and Conquer Tables","sourcePdf":"tpds-sookhak-2784423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092081S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8334163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8334163","articleId":"8219724","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219725,"authors":[{"name":"Tianfu Sun","affiliation":["University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K.","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8219725/sun-2784409-small.gif","p":["Tianfu Sun (S\u201915\u2013M\u201916) was born in China.

However, networks based on these purely passive devices can be affected by parasitic effects such as series resistance and sneak path problems. Here, we analyze the effects of parasitic factors on the performance of memristor-based neuromorphic systems. During vector-array multiplication, the line resistance can cause significant distortion of the output current and the activity of the corresponding neurons. An approach to compensate the line resistance effects based on an approximate model consisting of only few known parameters is proposed and shows excellent ability to capture the complex network behavior. During training and feature detection, the series resistance can cause significant degradation of the learned dictionary, with only a few dominant neurons being trained. Using a scaling factor based on the proposed simple model, these effects can be successfully mitigated, and the correct network operations can be restored. These results provide insight and practical measures on the parasitic effects for implementation of the neuromorphic system using memristor arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2017.2784364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2017.2784364","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8249911/08219726.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parasitic Effect Analysis in Memristor-Array-Based Neuromorphic Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Parasitic Effect Analysis in Memristor-Array-Based Neuromorphic Systems","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17485549","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219726/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"0011-13-2-0015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1617315"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitic Effect Analysis in Memristor-Array-Based Neuromorphic Systems","sourcePdf":"tnano-lu-2784364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091185S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8249911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8249911","articleId":"8219726","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8219728,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Jun Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8269342/8219728/zeng-2784361-small.gif","p":["Wen-Jun Zeng (S\u201910\u2013M\u201911) received the M.S. degree\n in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008.","He is a Senior Research Associate with the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong\n Kong.

We have considered, for each neural network, three different activation function complexities, to evaluate how the implementation affects FPGAs reliability. As we show in this paper, higher complexity increases the exposed area but reduces the probability of one failure to impact the network output. In addition, we propose to distinguish between critical and tolerable errors in artificial neural networks. Experiments using a controlled heavy-ions beam show that, for both networks, only about 30% of the observed output errors actually affect the outputs correctness. We identify the causes of critical errors through fault injection, and found that faults in initial layers are more likely to significantly affect the output.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reliability of Linear Regression and Pattern Recognition Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2017.2784367","startPage":"288","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2017.2784367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8263287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/8263287/08219730.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Reliability of Linear Regression and Pattern Recognition Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks in FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8219730/","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519269","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES Foundation of the Ministry of Education"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq Research Council of the Ministry of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Reliability of Linear Regression and Pattern Recognition Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks in FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-libano-2784367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073577S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8263287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8263287","articleId":"8219730","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219733,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8387923/8219733/fan-2784564-small.gif","p":["Hua Fan received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of\n Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012 and 2017,\n respectively.","From May 2014 to May 2015, he was a Visiting Scholar with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K. In July 2017,\n he joined the State Grid Zhejiang Information and Telecommunication Company, China.

In the case that the population of PEVs is huge, the large number of variables and constraints renders the centralized solution technique unsuitable to solve the MOPF problem. Therefore, a distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to decompose the MOPF into two update steps that are solved in an alternating and iterative style. To improve the solution efficiency, the second update step is transformed into a Euclidean projection problem by approximating the original objective with a surrogate function. Then, a projection algorithm is utilized to solve the approximate problem. Numerical results show that this reformulated model obtains suboptimal solutions with small relative error, but gains considerable speed-up. Furthermore, its scalability and effectiveness are tested in the 119-bus and 906-bus distribution networks.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2784564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8387923/08219733.pdf","startPage":"3886","endPage":"3897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2784564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADMM-Based Multiperiod Optimal Power Flow Considering Plug-In Electric Vehicles Charging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219733/","displayDocTitle":"ADMM-Based Multiperiod Optimal Power Flow Considering Plug-In Electric Vehicles Charging","volume":"33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17857579","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8219733/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51361130151"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/L001004/01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADMM-Based Multiperiod Optimal Power Flow Considering Plug-In Electric Vehicles Charging","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2784564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108173S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8387923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8387923","articleId":"8219733","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8219738,"authors":[{"name":"Kiryung Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kiryung Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2012.

One important question is how many measurements are needed for a stable reconstruction in the presence of measurement noise. Unlike conventional compressed sensing for sparse vectors, where convex relaxation via the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm achieves near-optimal performance, for compressed sensing of sparse low-rank matrices, it has been shown recently that convex programmings using the nuclear norm and the mixed norm are highly suboptimal even in the noise-free scenario. We propose an alternating minimization algorithm called sparse power factorization (SPF) for compressed sensing of sparse rank-one matrices. For a class of signals whose sparse representation coefficients are fast-decaying, SPF achieves stable recovery of the rank-one matrix formed by their outer product and requires number of measurements within a logarithmic factor of the information-theoretic fundamental limit. For the recovery of general sparse low-rank matrices, we propose subspace-concatenated SPF (SCSPF), which has analogous near-optimal performance guarantees to SPF in the rank-one case. Numerical results show that SPF and SCSPF empirically outperform convex programmings using the best known combinations of mixed norm and nuclear norm.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2784479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8293743/08219738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2784479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293743","startPage":"1666","endPage":"1698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Compressed Sensing of a Class of Sparse Low-Rank Matrices Via Sparse Power Factorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219738","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8293743/8219738-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Compressed Sensing of a Class of Sparse Low-Rank Matrices Via Sparse Power Factorization","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17581369","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219738/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 10-18789, CCF 10-18660 and IIS 14-47879"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF 14-23088 and IIS 14-47879"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Near-Optimal Compressed Sensing of a Class of Sparse Low-Rank Matrices Via Sparse Power Factorization","sourcePdf":"tit-lee-2784479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185404S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8293743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8293743","articleId":"8219738","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219741,"authors":[{"name":"Armando Biscontini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/8249911/8219741/bisco-2784363-small.gif","p":["Armando Biscontini received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.

Moreover, SAIC technology for QR signals is still required for voice services over adaptive multiuser channels on one slot (VAMOS) standard, a recent evolution of both GSM and enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) standards, to mitigate legacy GSM CCI in particular. It is also required for filter bank multicarrier offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC-OQAM) networks, which are candidate for 5G mobile networks, to mitigate intercarrier interference at reception for frequency selective propagation channels in particular. In this context, the purpose of this paper is twofold. The first one is to get more insights into the existing SAIC technology, and its extension to multiple antenna called multiple antenna interference cancellation (MAIC), by showing analytically that, contrary to what is accepted as true in the literature, SAIC/MAIC implemented from standard WL filtering may be less efficient for QR signals than for R ones. From this result, the second purpose of the paper is to propose and to analyze, for QR signals and frequency selective fading channels, an SAIC/MAIC enhancement based on a three-input WL frequency shift receiver, making QR signals always almost equivalent to R ones for WL filtering in the presence of CCI. The results of the paper, completely new, may contribute to develop elsewhere new powerful WL receivers for QR signals and for both VAMOS and FBMC-OQAM networks in particular.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Standards","GSM","Interference","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","5G mobile communication","cellular radio","channel bank filters","cochannel interference","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","multiuser channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QR signals","frequency selective fading channels","SAIC/MAIC enhancement","linear filtering","linear receivers","mobile communications handsets","adaptive multiuser channels","GSM evolution standards","filter bank multicarrier","quadrature amplitude modulation networks","5G mobile networks","intercarrier interference","frequency selective propagation channels","WL filtering","WL receivers","antenna interference cancellation","GSM CCI","SAIC technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-circular","widely linear","single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC)","rectilinear","quasi-rectilinear","CCI","continous-time","pseudo-MLSE","FRESH","MSK","GMSK","OQAM","ASK","VAMOS","FBMC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2784403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8277098/08219743.pdf","startPage":"1438","endPage":"1453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8277098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2784403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Widely Linear Filtering to Make Quasi-Rectilinear Signals Almost Equivalent to Rectilinear Ones for SAIC/MAIC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Widely Linear Filtering to Make Quasi-Rectilinear Signals Almost Equivalent to Rectilinear Ones for SAIC/MAIC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219743/","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8219743/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17573545","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Widely Linear Filtering to Make Quasi-Rectilinear Signals Almost Equivalent to Rectilinear Ones for SAIC/MAIC","sourcePdf":"tsp-chevalier-2784403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099268S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8277098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8277098","articleId":"8219743","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8219745,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Source, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8219745/chen-2784561-small.gif","p":["Meng Chen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and\n automation from the Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2013.

By using the outputs of estimators, which are reset to the actual values only at the event-triggered time, to replace the actual values in the feedback control laws, the proposed control strategies just require the communication between distributed secondary controllers at some particular instants while having frequency and voltage restoration function and accurate active power sharing.

In anomaly detection, while the anomalous data are arbitrary, the normal data have similarities and generally conforms to a particular model. However, the particular model that generates the normal data is generally unknown (even nonstationary) and needs to be learned sequentially. Therefore, a two stage approach is needed, where in the first stage, we construct a probability density function to model the normal data in the time series. Then, in the second stage, we threshold the density estimation of the newly observed data to detect anomalies. We approach this problem from an information theoretic perspective and propose minimax optimal schemes for both stages to create an optimal anomaly detection algorithm in a strong deterministic sense. To this end, for the first stage, we introduce a completely online density estimation algorithm that is minimax optimal with respect to the log-loss and achieves Merhav's lower bound for general nonstationary exponential-family of distributions without any assumptions on the observation sequence. For the second stage, we propose a threshold selection scheme that is minimax optimal (with logarithmic performance bounds) against the best threshold chosen in hindsight with respect to the surrogate logistic loss. Apart from the regret bounds, through synthetic and real life experiments, we demonstrate substantial performance gains with respect to the state-of-the-art density estimation based anomaly detection algorithms in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection With Minimax Optimal Density Estimation in Nonstationary Environments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2784390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08219756.pdf","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2784390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8219756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8219756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection With Minimax Optimal Density Estimation in Nonstationary Environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8219756/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17524211","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Turkish Academy of Sciences Outstanding Researcher Programme and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey","grantNumber":"113E517"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Anomaly Detection With Minimax Optimal Density Estimation in Nonstationary Environments","sourcePdf":"tsp-gokcesu-2784390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121878S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8219756","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8219815,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-3357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-3365"}],"articleNumber":"8219815","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"This index covers all technical items - papers, correspondence, reviews, etc. - that appeared in this periodical during the year, and items from previous years that were commented upon or corrected in this year.
