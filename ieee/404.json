Tapering a complete, uniformly spaced sequence is shown to suppress beam sidelobes, but the taper fails to suppress sidelobes when uniformity of sample spacing is destroyed by missing samples.

The architecture selected differs in several respects from both an explicit-sampling Nyquist ADC and an over-sampling ADC. A high-speed axis-crossing detector senses the difference between the input signal and an appropriate reference signal that determines the sampling rate and quantization scheme. The reference signal is chosen to have a peak-to-peak amplitude greater than the expected signal and a fundamental frequency greater than the Nyquist rate for the input. When the reference is a recurring linearly-increasing ramp then the ADC is a linear quantizer. When the reference signal is a sinusoid then the ADC is a companding quantizer and encodes the arcsine of the sample value. Since the times that the samples are taken depend on the value of the samples these variable sample time ADCs are referred to as implicit sampling converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Radio frequency","Bandwidth","Superconducting device noise","Cryogenics","Receivers","Superconducting filters","High temperature superconductors","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantisation (signal)","signal sampling","superconducting devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-temperature superconductor","multibit implicit-sampling ADC architecture","analog-to-digital converter","wide bandwidth RF application","linear quantizer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSPWS.2006.265444","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 12th Digital Signal Processing Workshop & 4th IEEE Signal Processing Education Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE 12th Digital Signal Processing Workshop & 4th IEEE Signal Processing Education Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041018/4041019/04041024.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSPWS.2006.265444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implicit Sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implicit Sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041024/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041024/","accessionNumber":"9407954","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit Sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter","confLoc":"Teton National Park, WY, USA","sourcePdf":"DSPWS-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036206S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041018","isNumber":"4041019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041018","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4041019","articleId":"4041024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4041029,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Wilzeck","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Department of Communication Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wilzeck","id":"37294237200"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Department of Communication Systems, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0535-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4041029","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Singular value decomposition","Frequency diversity","Peak to average power ratio","Transmitting antennas","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO single-carrier scheme","singular value decomposition","SVD-based processing","frequency domain","dominant eigenmode transmission","DET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Input Multiple Output","Single-Carrier","Singular Value Decomposition","Frequency Domain Equalization","Eigenmode"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we present a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing single-carrier (SC) transmission with frequency domain preand post-processing to allow a further adaptation of the transmission.

The information is encoded in the form of address-event representation (AER) data. An algorithm for object tracking with 1 millisecond timestamp resolution of the AER data stream is presented. As a real-world application example, vehicle tracking for a traffic-monitoring is demonstrated in real time. The potential of the proposed algorithm for people tracking is also shown.

Automatic speech recognition systems in particular, thanks to the simultaneous display of text, reduce the gap separating the deaf, or the hearing impaired in general, from the world of the hearing. The paper presents an automatic aid system for the hearing impaired while behind the wheel of a car. It proposes an algorithm, based on typical speech recognition techniques, for the identification and automatic signaling on a display of emergency signals such as sirens sounded by ambulances, fire engines or any other emergency service vehicle.

A formal definition and a sufficient condition for the existence of a fractional transform given a unitary periodic operator is given. Next, using an orthogonal projection formula the class of weighted discrete fractional Fourier transforms (WDFrFTs) is shown to be completely determined by four integer parameters.

Since these codes are cyclic, they can be used to correct erasures (errors at known positions) and detect errors, using the locator polynomial via the syndrome, with efficient algorithms. The stability of such codes are, however, very poor for burst error patterns. In such conditions, the stability of the system of equations to be solved is very poor. This amplifies the rounding errors inherent to the real number field. In order to improve the stability of real-number error-correcting codes, other types of coding matrices were considered, namely random orthogonal matrices. These type of codes have proven to be very stable, when compared to DFT codes. However, the problem of detecting errors (when the positions of these errors are not known) with random codes was not addressed. Such codes do not possess any specific structure which could be exploited to create an efficient algorithm.

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in Snorts ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041138/4041139/04041157.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"2006 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backtracking Algorithmic Complexity Attacks against a NIDS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Inspection","Protection","Bandwidth","Computer networks","Counting circuits","Wire","Protocols","TCPIP","Payloads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Backtracking Algorithmic Complexity Attacks against a NIDS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","conferenceDate":"11-15 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backtracking Algorithmic Complexity Attacks against a NIDS","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27160089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056537S","chronDate":"11-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041138","isNumber":"4041139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041138","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4041139","articleId":"4041157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4041161,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Sun","affiliation":["Intelligent, Automation, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37402509700"},{"name":"Pai Peng","affiliation":["Opsware, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Pai","lastName":"Peng","id":"37830599000"},{"name":"Peng Ning","affiliation":["NC State University, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ning","id":"37269721200"},{"name":"Cliff Wang","affiliation":["Army Research Office, USA"],"firstName":"Cliff","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310511300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2716-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9527"}],"articleNumber":"4041161","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Access protocols","Lead","Wireless application protocol","Nominations and elections","Clustering algorithms","Intelligent sensors","Scalability","Mobile communication","Sun"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041161","abstract":"In wireless sensor networks, clustering sensor nodes into small groups is an effective technique to achieve scalability, self-organization, power saving, channel access, routing, etc. A number of cluster formation protocols have been proposed recently.

Color Reduction of Image (CRI) is an important factor for segmentation, compression, presentation and transmission of images. The main purpose of CRI is to cut off the image storage spaces and computation time.

The main characteristics of KSOM are formation of topology preserving feature maps and approximation of input probability distribution. Growing Self-Organizing Neural Network (GSONN) has got more and more attentions in the past decade, to overcome some limitations of KSOM. An effective approach to solve CRI problem is to consider it as a clustering problem and solve it by using some adaptive clustering methods, such as KSOM and GSONN.

In the state of the art, it is assumed that all the particles have the same parameters, while in the real world; each individual has its own character, which means each particle has different parameters. In this paper, we study the feasibility and the behavior of local parameters for each particle in the PSO, and control the parameters by a simple algorithm. More advanced control algorithm can be applied to improve the search. Adjusting our PSO for different applications is easier as the swarm parameters are adjusted automatically for each particle. However, this modification of PSO can be applied for any type of PSO to improve it. As an example, we apply it to the hierarchical particle swarm optimization (HPSO). The results are obtained in static and dynamic environments. Local approach with a naive controller overcomes the other approaches in most of the cases.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2006.264935","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041373/4041374/04041432.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"52","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Sixth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS'06)","publicationTitle":"2006 Sixth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2006.264935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Parameters Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Local Parameters Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4041432/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Parameters Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"26620052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047709S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041373","isNumber":"4041374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041373","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4041374","articleId":"4041432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4041433,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Li","id":"37536143400"},{"name":"Xinhai Tong","affiliation":["Scientific Research Center, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinhai","lastName":"Tong","id":"37825547600"},{"name":"Sijiang Xie","affiliation":["Scientific Research Center, Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sijiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37833367200"},{"name":"Yingchun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37835096000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2662-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4041433","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041433","abstract":"A hybrid genetic algorithm based optimum path planning approach for mobile robots is proposed in this paper.

One is the overall classification rate of the string as an ensemble classifier. The other is the average classification rate of component classifiers in the ensemble classifier. As a diversity criterion, we use the entropy of outputs from component classifiers in the ensemble classifier.

Experimental results show that this algorithm has good imperceptibility and robustness against various interference (A-law/U-law compression, low-pass filtering, white noise, etc) when the speech is transmitted over the public switching telephone network (PSTN).

One of these methods is by means of broadcasting packets. Broadcasted packets occupy high percentage of network bandwidth, and abnormal broadcast traffic analysis could be a useful method for detecting network problems and infected hosts. In this paper a new method for detecting ARP abnormal traffic in a broadcast domain is introduced. A combination of four different ARP traffic criteria are used to determine network anomaly. Four parameters: Rate, Burstiness, Dark space and Sequential scan were considered. Our method focuses on rate anomaly caused by worms, scans and poorly-configured services. We applied our method to a real network to evaluate system accuracy and noticed that during one month, 92.9 percent of alarms were true positive alarms. This technique not only traces ARP anomaly the same way as scanning worms, but also it detects any host that disturbs the traffic rate in different LAN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multivariate Adaptive Method for Detecting ARP Anomaly in Local Area Networks","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICSNC.2006.5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications (ICSNC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041508/4041509/04041568.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSNC.2006.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A Multivariate Adaptive Method for Detecting ARP Anomaly in Local Area Networks","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-3 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041568/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multivariate Adaptive Method for Detecting ARP Anomaly in Local Area Networks","confLoc":"Tahiti, French Polynesia","sourcePdf":"26990053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056261S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041508","isNumber":"4041509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041508","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4041509","articleId":"4041568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4041585,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Tarhini","affiliation":["GET/Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, UMR CNRS 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Tarhini","id":"37658726400"},{"name":"Tijani Chahed","affiliation":["GET/Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, UMR CNRS 5157, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Tijani","lastName":"Chahed","id":"37280007900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2699-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4041585","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Modulation coding","Radio spectrum management","Throughput","Fading","Physical layer","OFDM modulation","MIMO","Bandwidth","Data communication"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the capacity of broadband wireless OFDMA-based WiMAX systems, in the presence of both constant-bit-rate streaming traffic as well as elastic one, under a dynamic configuration wherein users come to the system and leave it after a finite duration.

We propose a system that uses color and motion information extracted from video sequences to detect fire. Flame can be recognized according to its color which is a primary element of fire images. Thus choosing a suitable color model is the key to detect flames from fire images. An effective fire detection criterion based on color model is proposed in this paper by intensive experiments and trainings. The detection criterion is used to make a raw localization of fire regions first. However, color alone is not enough for fire detection. To identify a real burning fire, in addition to chromatic features, dynamic features are usually adopted to distinguish other fire aliases. In this paper, both the growth of fire region and the invariability of flame are utilized to further detect the fire regions as a complement of the detection criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed fire-alarming method is demonstrated by the experiments implemented on a large number of scenes.","doi":"10.1109/IIH-MSP.2006.265017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2006.265017","startPage":"359","endPage":"364","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041645/4041646/04041737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fire-Alarming Method Based on Video Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"A Fire-Alarming Method Based on Video Processing","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fire-Alarming Method Based on Video Processing","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"27450359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038639S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041645","isNumber":"4041646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041645","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4041646","articleId":"4041737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4041742,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhong Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37834118800"},{"name":"Haiyi Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Haiyi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37834694700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2745-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4041742","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of Chaos Encryption Algorithm Based on Logistic Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Cryptography","Logistics","Chaotic communication","Signal processing algorithms","Information security","Streaming media","Internet","Computer networks","Communication system security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041742","abstract":"With the development of network technique and the increasing frequency of information exchange, the research of information security technique is getting more and more important.

As the process technologies have scaled to smaller feature sizes, chip yields have dropped to around 50% or less. This figure is expected to decrease even further in future technologies. To attack this growing problem, we develop four yield-aware micro architecture schemes for data caches. The first one is called yield-aware power-down (YAPD). YAPD turns off cache ways that cause delay violation and/or have excessive leakage. We also modify this approach to achieve better yields. This new method is called horizontal YAPD (H-YAPD), which turns off horizontal regions of the cache instead of ways. A third approach targets delay violation in data caches. Particularly, we develop a variable-latency cache architecture (VACA). VACA allows different load accesses to be completed with varying latencies. This is enabled by augmenting the functional units with special buffers that allow the dependants of a load operation to stall for a cycle if the load operation is delayed. As a result, if some accesses take longer than the predefined number of cycles, the execution can still be performed correctly, albeit with some performance degradation. A fourth scheme we devise is called the hybrid mechanism, which combines the YAPD and the VACA. As a result of these schemes, chips that may be tossed away due to parametric yield loss can be saved. Experimental results demonstrate that the yield losses can be reduced by 68.1% and 72.4% with YAPD and H-YAPD schemes and by 33.3% and 81.1% with VACA and Hybrid mechanisms, respectively, improving the overall yield to as much as 97.0%","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.52","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041832.pdf","startPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield-Aware Cache Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041832/","displayDocTitle":"Yield-Aware Cache Architectures","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9353297","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4041832/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield-Aware Cache Architectures","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0603S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4041840,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaotong Zhuang","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

In this paper, we propose the use of empirical non-linear modeling techniques to assist processor architects in making design decisions and resolving complex trade-offs. We propose a procedure for building accurate non-linear models that consists of the following steps: (i) selection of a small set of representative design points spread across processor design space using latin hypercube sampling, (ii) obtaining performance measures at the selected design points using detailed simulation, (iii) building non-linear models for performance using the function approximation capabilities of radial basis function networks, and (iv) validating the models using an independently and randomly generated set of design points. We evaluate our model building procedure by constructing non-linear performance models for programs from the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite with a microarchitectural design space that consists of 9 key parameters. Our results show that the models, built using a relatively small number of simulations, achieve high prediction accuracy (only 2.8% error in CPI estimates on average) across a large processor design space.

Maintaining identical instruction streams is challenging because redundant cores operate independently, yet must still receive the same inputs (e.g., load values and shared-memory invalidations). Past proposals strictly replicate load values across two cores, requiring significant changes to the highly-optimized core. We make the key observation that, in the common case, both cores load identical values without special hardware. When the cores do receive different load values (e.g., due to a data race), the same mechanisms employed for soft error detection and recovery can correct the difference. This observation permits designs that relax input replication, while still providing correct redundant execution. In this paper, we present Reunion, an execution model that provides relaxed input replication and preserves the existing memory interface, coherence protocols, and consistency models. We evaluate a CMP-based implementation of the Reunion execution model with full-system, cycle-accurate simulation. We show that the performance overhead of relaxed input replication is only 5% and 6% for commercial and scientific workloads, respectively","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041849.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reunion: Complexity-Effective Multicore Redundancy","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.42","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Reunion: Complexity-Effective Multicore Redundancy","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9353310","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4041849/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reunion: Complexity-Effective Multicore Redundancy","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063665S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4041858,"authors":[{"name":"Chrysostomos A.

As diminishing feature sizes have led to increases in global wiring delays, network-on-chip (NoC) architectures are viewed as a possible solution to the wiring challenge and have recently crystallized into a significant research thrust. Both NoC performance and energy budget depend heavily on the routers' buffer resources. This paper introduces a novel unified buffer structure, called the dynamic virtual channel regulator (ViChaR), which dynamically allocates virtual channels (VC) and buffer resources according to network traffic conditions. ViChaR maximizes throughput by dispensing a variable number of VCs on demand. Simulation results using a cycle-accurate simulator show a performance increase of 25% on average over an equal-size generic router buffer, or similar performance using a 50% smaller buffer.

The gap between average and peak power actually widens with increased levels of core integration. As such, if per-core control of power levels (modes) is possible, a global power manager should be able to dynamically set the modes suitably. This would be done in tune with the workload characteristics, in order to always maintain a chip-level power that is below the specified budget. Furthermore, this should be possible without significant degradation of chip-level throughput performance. We analyze and validate this concept in detail in this paper. We assume a per-core DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) knob to be available to such a conceptual global power manager. We evaluate several different policies for global multi-core power management. In this analysis, we consider various different objectives such as prioritization and optimized throughput. Overall, our results show that in the context of a workload comprised of SPEC benchmark threads, our best architected policies can come within 1% of the performance of an ideal oracle, while meeting a given chip-level power budget. Furthermore, we show that these global dynamic management policies perform significantly better than static management, even if static scheduling is given oracular knowledge","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.8","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041859.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analysis of Efficient Multi-Core Global Power Management Policies: Maximizing Performance for a Given Power Budget","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Efficient Multi-Core Global Power Management Policies: Maximizing Performance for a Given Power Budget","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041859/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9353314","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041859/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of Efficient Multi-Core Global Power Management Policies: Maximizing Performance for a Given Power Budget","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108854S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"352","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4041860,"authors":[{"name":"Canturk Isci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Canturk","lastName":"Isci","id":"37564776200"},{"name":"Gilberto Contreras","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Gilberto","lastName":"Contreras","id":"37564391800"},{"name":"Margaret Martonosi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Margaret","lastName":"Martonosi","id":"37332404000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2732-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4041860","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":158,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Energy management","Power system management","Dynamic voltage scaling","Frequency","Computerized monitoring","Application software","Computer architecture","Fuels","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","power aware computing","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime phase monitoring","runtime phase prediction","real systems","dynamic power management","computer architecture","workload variations","phase analysis","on-the-fly system management techniques","fully-functional deployed system","dynamic voltage-frequency scaling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Live, Runtime Phase Monitoring and Prediction on Real Systems with Application to Dynamic Power Management","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.30","startPage":"359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041860","abstract":"Computer architecture has experienced a major paradigm shift from focusing only on raw performance to considering power-performance efficiency as the defining factor of the emerging systems. Along with this shift has come increased interest in workload characterization. This interest fuels two closely related areas of research. First, various studies explore the properties of workload variations and develop methods to identify and track different execution behavior, commonly referred to as \"phase analysis\". Second, a large complementary set of research studies dynamic, on-the-fly system management techniques that can adaptively respond to these differences in application behavior. Both of these lines of work have produced very interesting and widely useful results. Thus far, however, there exists only a weak link between these conceptually related areas, especially for real-system studies. Our work aims to strengthen this link by demonstrating a real-system implementation of a runtime phase predictor that works cooperatively with on-the-fly dynamic management. We describe a fully-functional deployed system that performs accurate phase predictions on running applications. The key insight of our approach is to draw from prior branch predictor designs to create a phase history table that guides predictions. To demonstrate the value of our approach, we implement a prototype system that uses it to guide dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Our runtime phase prediction methodology achieves above 90% prediction accuracies for many of the experimented benchmarks. For highly variable applications, our approach can reduce mispredictions by more than 6X over commonly-used statistical approaches. Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling, when guided by our runtime phase predictor, achieves energy-delay product improvements as high as 34% for benchmarks with non-negligible variability, on average 7% better than previous methods and 18% better than a baseline unmanaged system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9353315","htmlLink":"/document/4041860/","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Live, Runtime Phase Monitoring and Prediction on Real Systems with Application to Dynamic Power Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live, Runtime Phase Monitoring and Prediction on Real Systems with Application to Dynamic Power Management","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077046S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4041861,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Youssef","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Youssef","id":"37275706900"},{"name":"Mohab Anis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohab","lastName":"Anis","id":"37281708400"},{"name":"Mohamed Elmasry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elmasry","id":"37276008000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2732-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4041861","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":214},"abstract":"Leakage power is projected to comprise approximately 50% of the processor's power for sub 65 nm technologies. Much of this power is consumed in the processor's functional units. Accordingly, leakage control techniques are employed to reduce leakage in these functional units. Many of these techniques are dynamic and are based on an input sleep signal to initiate a low leakage mode. However, since most of these leakage control techniques are based on circuit level schemes, such techniques inherently lack information about the operational profile of the functional units they manage. This limitation is usually handled statically by using a fixed length counter that generates the sleep signal when the functional unit is idle for a specified number of cycles. In this paper, the limitations of the static sleep signal generation approach are identified, and the use of a dynamic alternative that is capable of adopting the counter length to the running application is proposed. In order to assess the accuracy of the proposed dynamic sleep signal generator, the length of the sleep period following the sleep signal generation is used as a metric to identify the usefulness of utilizing the dynamic approach. Experimental results for the dynamic alternative shows up to 98% accuracy in predicting the length of the standby period compared to an average of 40-60% in the static case, which translates into increased leakage savings. This is achieved while consuming 360 muW of overhead power at 1 GHz","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041861.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Standby Prediction for Leakage Tolerant Microprocessor Functional Units","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Signal generators","Energy consumption","Threshold voltage","Counting circuits","Signal processing","Power semiconductor switches","Delay","Accuracy","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","logic design","low-power electronics","microprocessor chips","signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic standby prediction","leakage tolerant microprocessor functional units","leakage power control techniques","circuit level schemes","static sleep signal generation","dynamic sleep signal generator","DSSG design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Standby Prediction for Leakage Tolerant Microprocessor Functional Units","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041861/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9353316","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Standby Prediction for Leakage Tolerant Microprocessor Functional Units","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058372S","chronDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4041862,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjith Subramanian","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ranjith","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37827081100"},{"name":"Yannis Smaragdakis","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Smaragdakis","id":"37265392900"},{"name":"Gabriel H.

Specifically, we describe a novel and general scheme by which we can combine any two cache management algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU, FIFO, Random) and adaptively switch between them, closely tracking the locality characteristics of a given program. The scheme is inspired by recent work in virtual memory management at the operating system level, which has shown that it is possible to adapt over two replacement policies to provide an aggregate policy that always performs within a constant factor of the better component policy. A hardware implementation of adaptivity requires very simple logic but duplicate tag structures. To reduce the overhead, we use partial tags, which achieve good performance with a small hardware cost. In particular, adapting between LRU and LFU replacement policies on an 8-way 512KB L2 cache yields a 12.7% improvement in average CPI on applications that exhibit a non-negligible L2 miss ratio.

Unfortunately, current cache hierarchies have miss-handling architectures (MHAs) that are too limited to support the required MLP - they need to be redesigned to support 1-2 orders of magnitude more outstanding misses. Yet, designing scalable MHAs is challenging: designs must minimize cache lock-up time and deliver high bandwidth while keeping the area consumption reasonable. This paper presents a novel scalable MHA design for high-MLP processors. Our design introduces two main innovations. First, it is hierarchical, with a small MSHR file per cache bank, and a larger MSHR file shared by all banks. Second, it uses a Bloom filter to reduce searches in the larger MSHR file. The result is a high-performance, area-efficient design. Compared to a state-of-the-art MHA on a high-MLP processor, our design speeds-up some SPECint, SPECfp, and multiprogrammed workloads by a geometric mean of 32%, 50%, and 95%, respectively. Moreover, compared to two extrapolations of current MHA designs, namely a large monolithic MSHR file and a large banked MSHR file, all consuming the same area, our design speeds-up the workloads by a geometric mean of 1-18% and 10-21%, respectively.

The commonly used LRU policy implicitly partitions a shared cache on a demand basis, giving more cache resources to the application that has a high demand and fewer cache resources to the application that has a low demand. However, a higher demand for cache resources does not always correlate with a higher performance from additional cache resources. It is beneficial for performance to invest cache resources in the application that benefits more from the cache resources rather than in the application that has more demand for the cache resources. This paper proposes utility-based cache partitioning (UCP), a low-overhead, runtime mechanism that partitions a shared cache between multiple applications depending on the reduction in cache misses that each application is likely to obtain for a given amount of cache resources. The proposed mechanism monitors each application at runtime using a novel, cost-effective, hardware circuit that requires less than 2kB of storage. The information collected by the monitoring circuits is used by a partitioning algorithm to decide the amount of cache resources allocated to each application.

Some CMPs use a shared L2 cache to maximize the on-chip cache capacity and minimize off-chip misses. Others use private L2 caches, replicating data to limit the delay due to global wires and minimize cache access time. Recent hybrid proposals use selective replication to balance latency and capacity, but their static replication rules result in performance degradation for some combinations of workloads and system configurations. This paper proposes adaptive selective replication (ASR), a mechanism that dynamically monitors workload behavior to control replication. ASR replicates cache blocks only when it estimates the benefit of replication (lower L2 hit latency) exceeds the cost (more L2 misses). Full-system simulations of 8-processor CMPs show that ASR provides robust performance: improving performance by as much as 29% versus shared caches, 19% versus private caches, and 12% versus CMP-NuRapid and Victim Replication. Furthermore, while ASR does not improve the performance of all workloads, it provides performance stability by always performing at least comparably to the best alternative including cooperative caching","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041867.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"454","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASR: Adaptive Selective Replication for CMP Caches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Stress","Delay effects","Wires","Proposals","Degradation","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Costs","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive selective replication","L2 cache","chip multiprocessor","workload behavior monitoring","performance degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"ASR: Adaptive Selective Replication for CMP Caches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041867/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9353320","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASR: Adaptive Selective Replication for CMP Caches","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126845S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4041868,"authors":[{"name":"Sangyeun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Sangyeun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293575700"},{"name":"Lei Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Jin","id":"37690182300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2732-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1072-4451"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-3155"}],"articleNumber":"4041868","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":171,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":490},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Multicore processing","Network-on-a-chip","Telecommunication traffic","Hardware","Bandwidth","Design optimization","Equations","Tiles","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","storage allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OS-level page allocation","distributed L2 cache management","multicore processor design","OS-micro architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents and studies a distributed L2 cache management approach through OS-level page allocation for future many-core processors.

Unlike previously studied hardware-based private and shared cache designs implementing a \"fixed\" caching policy, the proposed OS-micro architecture approach is flexible; it can easily implement a wide spectrum of L2 caching policies without complex hardware support.

The result of 3D die stacking is a significant reduction of interconnect both within a die and across dies in a system. For instance, blocks within a microprocessor can be placed vertically on multiple die to reduce block to block wire distance, latency, and power. Disparate Si technologies can also be combined in a 3D die stack, such as DRAM stacked on a CPU, resulting in lower power higher BW and lower latency interfaces, without concern for technology integration into a single process flow. 3D has the potential to change processor design constraints by providing substantial power and performance benefits.

We also illustrate the importance of closing the gap in expected delay of these distinct structures. A post fabrication test and configuration strategy is proposed. We find that 23% mean frequency improvement with an average IPC loss of 3% (and never exceeding 5% for worst case chips) is possible for the 65nm technology node by properly adopting the proposed schemes","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating the Impact of Process Variations on Processor Register Files and Execution Units","publicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2006.37","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4041820/4041821/04041872.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2006.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4041821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4041872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4041872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating the Impact of Process Variations on Processor Register Files and Execution Units","conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4041872/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9353323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating the Impact of Process Variations on Processor Register Files and Execution Units","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27320504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095867S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4041820","isNumber":"4041821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4041820","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4041821","articleId":"4041872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4041887,"authors":[{"name":"Luong D.

Combination of ECC, particularly SECDED, with a redundancy technique can effectively tolerate a high number of defects. While SECDED can repair a defective cell in a block, the block becomes vulnerable to soft errors. This paper proposes SEVA, an original soft-error- and variation-aware cache architecture. SEVA exploits SECDED to tolerate variation-induced defects while preserving high resilience against soft errors. Information about the defectiveness and data dirtiness is maintained for each SECDED block. SEVA allows only the clean data to be stored in defective (but still usable) blocks of a cache. An error occurring in a defective block can be detected and the correct data can be obtained from the lower level of the memory hierarchy.

However the localization turns out to be more challenging when multiple sound sources should be localized in multiple dimensions, due to a spatial ambiguity phenomenon which requires to perform an intermediate step after the TDOA estimation and before the calculation of the geometrical source positions. In order to obtain the required set of TDOA estimates for the multidimensional localization of multiple sound sources, we apply a recently presented TDOA estimation method based on blind adaptive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system identification. We demonstrate that this localization method also provides valuable side information which allows us to resolve the spatial ambiguity without any prior knowledge about the source positions. Furthermore we show that the blind adaptive MIMO system identification allows a high spatial resolution.

The generalization of these efforts can be called 'multi-signal' evaluation, being a fundamental component of a 'multi-component' sensor as the entirety of sensor elements and signal processing tools combined in a smart sensor. Its potential to increase the usefulness of simple low-cost of-the-shelf-components is shown on behalf of wind and weather sensors made of commonly available temperature-depending resistors. The proposed wind vector sensor consists of three PTC (positive temperature coefficient) elements placed under a known angle to each other around a cylindrical flow body. The wind velocity as well as the wind direction are calculated from output voltages by an optimization procedure.

Meanwhile, the design of cost-effective receivers for MIMO channels remains a challenging task. Maximum-likelihood (ML) detector can achieve superb performance, yet the computational complexity is enormously high. Receivers based on sphere decoding (SD) reach the performance of ML detectors, and potentially a great deal of computational cost can be saved. In this paper, a practical sphere-decoding algorithm is proposed. It utilizes a simple and effective way to set the initial radius which plays a decisive role in determining the computational complexity. Furthermore, a pseudo-antenna augmentation scheme is employed such that SD can be applied where the number of receive antennas is less than that of transmit antennas; thus enhance the applicability of this powerful algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270853","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042194/4042195/04042295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042195","startPage":"502","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sphere Decoding Algorithm for MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sphere Decoding Algorithm for MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042295/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9387948","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4042295/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sphere Decoding Algorithm for MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059508S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042194","isNumber":"4042195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042194","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4042195","articleId":"4042295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4042304,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Maltsev","affiliation":["Mobility Group, Intel Corporation, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Maltsev","id":"37274004200"},{"name":"Roman Maslennikov","affiliation":["Mobility Group, Intel Corporation, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Maslennikov","id":"37396098700"},{"name":"Alexey Khoryaev","affiliation":["Mobility Group, Intel Corporation, Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Khoryaev","id":"37396105200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9754-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9753-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"4042304","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Transfer functions","Interchannel interference","Background noise","Receiving antennas","Signal processing","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","cochannel interference","covariance matrices","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","signal detection","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative analysis","spatial covariance matrix estimation methods","OFDM communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems","multiple antenna techniques","co-channel interference mitigation","minimum mean square error signal detection algorithm","additive noise spatial covariance matrix","frequency correlation","propagation channel","channel impulse response delay spread"]}],"abstract":"The performance of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems may be significantly improved by use of the multiple antenna techniques. One of the multiple antenna techniques applications is the co-channel interference mitigation by exploiting the minimum mean square error (MMSE) signal detection algorithm. The realization of the algorithm requires knowledge of interference plus additive noise spatial covariance matrix (SCM) estimate for every subcarrier of the OFDM symbol. In this paper the independent SCM estimation for every subcarrier of OFDM symbol is considered first and then the algorithm is proposed for the enhancement of such estimate by taking into account the frequency correlation of the propagation channel and additional knowledge of OFDM symbol structure. As a result, it is shown that exploiting of the a priori information about the channel impulse response delay spread and symbol structure may lead to the significant improvement of the estimation accuracy","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation Methods in OFDM Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270862","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042194/4042195/04042304.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Analysis of Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation Methods in OFDM Communication Systems","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042304/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9398168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Analysis of Spatial Covariance Matrix Estimation Methods in OFDM Communication Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033604S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042194","isNumber":"4042195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042194","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4042195","articleId":"4042304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4042319,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Mottaghi-Kashtiban","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Mottaghi-Kashtiban","id":"38273374700"},{"name":"Saeed Farazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Farazi","id":"38270121000"},{"name":"Mahrokh G.

It is in many cases necessary to use quiet periods, when only noise is received, to estimate the noise covariance. If estimation of the signal parameters, such as directions of arrivals (DOAs), and noise covariance is performed jointly, performance can be improved. This is especially true when stationarity considerations limit the amount of available, valid noise-only data. This is shown in an earlier work, together with the introduction of an optimal weighting for weighted subspace fitting (WSF), when based on whitened data. An asymptotically valid approximative maximum likelihood method (AML) for the DOA estimation problem is derived in this paper. The resulting criterion can be concentrated with respect to the signal parameters. In numerical experiments, AML shows very promising small-sample performance compared to earlier methods. The associated criterion function is well suited for numerical optimization and allows for the development of a novel, MODE-like, non-iterative estimation procedure if the array belongs to the important class of uniform linear arrays. This non-iterative resulting procedure retains the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood, and numerical simulations indicate superior threshold performance when compared to an optimally weighted WSF formulation of MODE. For the detection problem, no method has been presented that takes the unknown noise covariance into account. Here, a well known detection scheme for WSF is extended to work in this scenario as well. The derivations of this scheme further stress the importance of correctly weighting WSF when the noise covariance is unknown. It is also shown that the minimum value of the criterion function associated with AML can be used for the detection purpose. Numerical experiments indicate promising performance for the AML-detection scheme","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270884","startPage":"666","endPage":"671","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042195","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042194/4042195/04042326.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient use of signal-free samples for DOA estimation and detection in colored noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042326/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient use of signal-free samples for DOA estimation and detection in colored noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042326/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9398174","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient use of signal-free samples for DOA estimation and detection in colored noise","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054206S","chronDate":"Aug.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042194","isNumber":"4042195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042194","xplore-issue":"4042195","articleId":"4042326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4042338,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Masly","affiliation":["Electrical and.

Coding is promising because of its inherit error-correcting property. However, its extremely low coding rate in cases of large number of subcarriers prevents its application. Many criteria involve in the selection of a PAR reduction technique, e.g., PAR reduction capacity, power increase, bit error rate increase, complexity, and throughput. A main consideration is that the cost of extra complexity for PAR reduction is lower than the cost of power inefficiency.

In a second step, an original algorithm is also proposed to reduce either the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) or the cubic metric (CM) of the OFDM/OQAM signal","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270916","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042194/4042195/04042358.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042195","startPage":"846","endPage":"850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Spectral Density and Cubic Metric for the OFDM/OQAM Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042358","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Spectral Density and Cubic Metric for the OFDM/OQAM Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042358/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9398182","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4042358/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Spectral Density and Cubic Metric for the OFDM/OQAM Modulation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"ISSPIT-00-163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041413S","chronDate":"27-30 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042194","isNumber":"4042195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042194","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4042195","articleId":"4042358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4042359,"authors":[{"name":"Masao Shimizu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37280081400"},{"name":"Soonkeun Chang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Soonkeun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37716879900"},{"name":"Masatoshi Okutomi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Okutomi","id":"37270663800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9754-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9753-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"4042359","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042359","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Image registration","Pixel","Motion estimation","Parameter estimation","Lighting","Image sequences","Signal processing","Information technology","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","image sequences","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accurate image registration","pixel selection","real image sequences","motion parameter estimation","illumination change","approximation error","rough-but-robust registration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image registration","area-based matching","illumination change","occlusion","image sequence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270917","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042194/4042195/04042359.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","startPage":"851","endPage":"856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust and Accurate Image Registration with Pixel Selection","abstract":"Image registration for real image sequences often fails to estimate accurate motion parameters because of illumination change, occlusion or an approximation error of a specific motion model.

In contrast to existing SDP formulations which require a large number of additional variables, our SDP representation only uses a minimal number of additional variables.

In particular, the system makes a dynamic choice of HMM model related to the different types of noise and corresponding to different signal to noise ratios (SNR). The system was implemented and the tests performed using the AURORA2 database. The results were compared with a nonadaptive classification system in the presence of clean conditions and 4 different types of background noise and with 6 different SNRs.

The approach exploits a recently-introduced GA, called orthogonal GA (OGA), based on the so-called experimental design technique to obtain fixed-point implementations of linear-phase FIR filters. In the proposed approach, the filter coefficients are treated as chromosomes to be optimized and the effects of finite word length are minimized by considering the filter as a cascade of two sections. The OGA employs an integer encoding scheme for chromosome construction whereby the filter coefficients are expressed in terms of sums of powers of two to obtain the multiplierless design. The optimization is carried out by minimizing an objective function based on the amplitude response error.

Modern FPGAs narrow this gap by including \"hard\" circuits such as memories and multipliers, which are very efficient when they are used. However, if these hard circuits are not used, they go wasted (including the very expensive programmable routing that surrounds the logic) and have a negative impact on logic density. In this paper we propose a new architectural concept, called shadow clusters, that seeks to mitigate this loss. A shadow cluster is a standard FPGA logic \"cluster\" that is placed \"behind\" every hard circuit and can programmably, through simple, small multiplexers, replace the hard circuit in the event it isn't needed. The authors measure the area-efficiency of FPGAs with and without shadow clusters and show that a modern commercial architecture (with a fixed ratio of multipliers to soft logic) would gain 4.7% in area-efficiency by employing shadow clusters. Indeed, every architecture we studied under \"reasonable\" conditions never showed a loss of area-efficiency. Furthermore, we show that most area-efficient architecture that employs the shadow cluster concept is 12.5 % better than the most area-efficient architecture without shadow clusters","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270384","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042409.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the area-efficiency of FPGAs with hard circuits using shadow clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042409/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the area-efficiency of FPGAs with hard circuits using shadow clusters","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9297761","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042409/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the area-efficiency of FPGAs with hard circuits using shadow clusters","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064424S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4042411,"authors":[{"name":"Masakazu Hioki","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Hioki","id":"37836199200"},{"name":"Takashi Kawanami","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kawanami","id":"37824463600"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Tsutsumi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Meiji University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Tsutsumi","id":"37269309600"},{"name":"Tadashi Nakagawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37587947800"},{"name":"Toshihiro Sekigawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Sekigawa","id":"37275488900"},{"name":"Hanpei Koike","affiliation":["National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan"],"firstName":"Hanpei","lastName":"Koike","id":"37269330000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042411","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042411","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Threshold voltage","Voltage control","Field programmable gate arrays","Energy consumption","Flexible printed circuits","Leakage current","CMOS technology","Integrated circuit technology","CMOS integrated circuits","Subthreshold current"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["threshold voltage control","flex power FPGA","static power consumption","area-overhead","body-bias units","granular control"]}],"abstract":"The flex power FPGA can flexibly control speed and power in a trade-off relationship by a flexible assignment of proper threshold voltage generated from body-bias units to transistors. This paper evaluates static power consumption and an area-overhead by the body-bias units on various threshold voltage control granularity in the flex power FPGA. There is also a trade-off relationship between the static power consumption and the area-overhead for granular control of the threshold voltages.

Theoretically, image matching algorithms based on partial Hausdorff distance (HD) are more tolerant of perturbations in the locations of pixel points than other algorithms, but they are too computationally expensive to be used in embedded systems. In order to solve this problem, we present a robust and real-time implementation of the image matching algorithm based on partial HD, taking advantage of the hardware resources offered by the FPGA chips. A parallel target recognition algorithm under constraints of limited embedded memory and limited memory bandwidth is proposed first. And then the system is organized as a coarse-grained pipeline containing three stages. Each stage is implemented in highly parallel fashion. The implementation of distance transform and template matching are described in detail. Experimental results show that our work outperforms related proposals.

Although this makes transistors faster, wires get slower. As FPGA device designers strive to obtain the lowest possible circuit delays from a given technology node, they must take an increasingly interconnect-focused viewpoint in the design process. In particular, for long interconnect wires, signals now require rebuffering somewhere in the middle of the wire. This paper presents a framework for designing and evaluating long, buffered interconnect wires in FPGAs with near-optimal delay performance. Given a target physical wire length, width and spacing, the method determines the number, size, and position of buffers required to obtain the fastest signal velocity for programmable interconnect. A metric introduced during the design is the \"path delay profile\", or the arrival time of a signal at different points of a long wire. This method is used to design buffering strategies for interconnect based on 0.5mm, 2mm, and 3mm wire lengths in 180nm technology. These interconnect designs are coded into VPR along with an improved timing analyzer which accurately determines the \"path delay profile\" arrival times. Using VPR, average critical-path delay is reduced by 19% for 0.5mm wires and by up to 46% for 3mm wires over previous designs given in Lemieux et al.

The delay also varies by up to 3.66% across a single die from correlated sources of variability. The results are extrapolated to determine the impact at future technology nodes. The predicted significant performance degradation that variability will cause demonstrates the importance of new circuit or system design techniques to cope with variations in future FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270300","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042421.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Within-die delay variability in 90nm FPGAs and beyond","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Within-die delay variability in 90nm FPGAs and beyond","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9297774","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042421/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Within-die delay variability in 90nm FPGAs and beyond","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074248S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4042422,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitrij Kissler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hardware-Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dmitrij","lastName":"Kissler","id":"37298518700"},{"name":"Frank Hannig","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hardware-Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Hannig","id":"37266978900"},{"name":"Alexey Kupriyanov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hardware-Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Kupriyanov","id":"37298519200"},{"name":"Jurgen Teich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hardware-Software-Co-Design, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042422","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"abstract":"In this paper a new class of highly parameterizable coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures called weakly programmable processor arrays is discussed.

This paper focuses on regular expressions pattern matching engines implemented in reconfigurable hardware. A nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) based implementation was presented, which takes advantage of new basic building blocks to support more complex regular expressions than the previous approaches. The methodology is supported by a tool that automatically generates the circuitry for the given regular expressions, outputting VHDL representations ready for logic synthesis. Furthermore, techniques to reduce the area cost of our designs and maximize performance when targeting FPGAs were included. Experimental results show that our tool is able to generate a regular expression engine to match more than 500 IDS regular expressions (from the Snort ruleset) using only 25K logic cells and achieving 2 Gbps throughput on a Virtex2 and 2.9 on a Virtex4 device.

Due to the inherent parallelism of the existing pairing algorithms, high performance can be achieved via hardware realizations. Three schemes for Tate pairing computations have been proposed in the literature: cubic elliptic, binary elliptic, and binary hyperelliptic. For our implementation we have chosen the binary elliptic case because of the simple underlying algorithms and efficient binary arithmetic. In this paper, we propose a new FPGA-based architecture of the Tate pairing-based computation over the binary fields F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2239</sub>\n and F \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2283</sub>\n. Even though our field sizes are larger than in the architectures based on cubic elliptic curves or binary hyperelliptic curves with the same security strength, nevertheless fewer multiplications in the underlying field need to performed. As a result, the computational latency for a pairing computation has been reduced, and our implementation runs 10-to-20 times faster than the equivalent implementations of other pairing-based schemes at the same level of security strength. At the same time, an improvement in the product of latency by area by a factor between 12 and 46 for an equivalent type of implementation has been achieved","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270309","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042431.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA accelerated tate pairing based cryptosystems over binary fields","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9309075","htmlLink":"/document/4042431/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA accelerated tate pairing based cryptosystems over binary fields","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063387S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4042432,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Angelopoulou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Angelopoulou","id":"37395291500"},{"name":"Konstantinos Masselos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Masselos","id":"37271402100"},{"name":"Peter Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37272281900"},{"name":"Yiannis Andreopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiannis","lastName":"Andreopoulos","id":"37284032400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042432","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of 2-D discrete wavelet transform computation schedules on FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042432.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270310","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Processor scheduling","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Filtering","Throughput","Educational institutions","Buildings","Costs","Hydrogen"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D discrete wavelet transform","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042432","abstract":"When it comes to the computation of the 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT), three major computation schedules have been proposed, namely the row-column, the line-based and the block-based.

This imposes limitations on hardware and software interfacing, narrows available programming paradigms, and affects application portability. Advanced programming concepts, such as multithreading, usually demand additional activities on the programmer side, to perform memory transfers and enforce memory consistency. In this paper, we introduce a system layer (an OS extension relying on a system hardware extension) that provides: (1) unified virtual memory, (2) platform-agnostic interfacing, and (3) multithreaded execution, for hardware accelerators running within the same OS process with user software. The system layer releases software programmer and hardware designer from interfacing burdens and, still, achieves significant speedups over software with only limited overheads. Virtual-memory-enabled hardware accelerators benefit from all abstractions and services already available to software. To prove our concept in practice and demonstrate the ease of programming, we execute image processing and cryptography applications on reconfigurable systems-on-chip running GNU/Linux that supports virtual memory for multithreaded hardware accelerators","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042434.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multithreaded virtual-memory-enabled reconfigurable hardware accelerators","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Multithreaded virtual-memory-enabled reconfigurable hardware accelerators","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9297767","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4042434/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multithreaded virtual-memory-enabled reconfigurable hardware accelerators","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042784S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4042435,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener","id":"37300389000"},{"name":"Jurgen Teich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042435","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042435","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Watermarking","Decoding","Voltage","Cryptography","Protection","Detection algorithms","Humans","Frequency","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","security of data","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["core watermarking","power signature analysis","watermark FPGA cores","power supply pins","netlist level","bitfile level","Xilinx","detection algorithm","signature decoding","voltage trace"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new method to watermark FPGA cores where the signature (watermark) is detected at the power supply pins of the FPGA. This is the first watermarking method, where the signature is extracted in this way. The authors were able to sign cores at the netlist as well as the bitfile level, so a wide spectrum of cores can be protected. The power watermarking method works with all types of FPGAs, but with Xilinx FPGAs, the watermarking algorithms and the signature can be integrated into the functionality of the watermarked core. So it is very hard to remove the watermark without destroying the core. A detection algorithm was introduced which can decode the signature from a voltage trace with high probability. Additionally, a second algorithm is introduced which improves the detection probability in case of considerable noise sources. Using this algorithm, it is possible to decode the signature even if other cores operate on the same device at the same time","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042435.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270313","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA core watermarking based on power signature analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA core watermarking based on power signature analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042435/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4042435/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9309089","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA core watermarking based on power signature analysis","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053429S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4042436,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Ronan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Ronan","id":"37296398900"},{"name":"Colm O'hEigeartaigh","affiliation":["School of Computing, Dublin City University,Ballymun, Dublin 9, Ireland"],"firstName":"Colm","lastName":"O'hEigeartaigh","id":"37088076800"},{"name":"Colin Murphy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37297948200"},{"name":"Michael Scott","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","School of Computing, Dublin City University, Ballymun, Ireland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Scott","id":"37272359300"},{"name":"Tim Kerins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Kerins","id":"37283301800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042436","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042436","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Hardware","Elliptic curve cryptography","Identity-based encryption","Elliptic curves","Computer architecture","Iterative algorithms","Pipeline processing","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","Tate pairing","etaT method","hardware architectures","hardware pipelining scheme","cryptographic processor","bilinear pairing","reconfigurable architectures","rapid prototyping"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a dedicated hardware implementation of the cryptographic Tate pairing on an elliptic curve of characteristic 2 using theeta\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n method.

The controller adds multithreading and networking to the processor design, and the option of SIMD processing. The complexity issue of high precision floating point in an FPGA implementation is taken care of by efficiently implementing a recent algorithm of Rump that computes the dot product of two vectors at the same level of precision as a double precision processor yet using single precision operations only including a few non-standard primitives. For these special operations, our FPGA based processor actually outperforms hardwired floating-point DSP chips performing them in software.

In order to support this, we aim to generate a wiring infrastructure that caters for the dynamically-changing module interfaces. This, however, imposes a regular structure for laying out modules on a device, which may result in longer inter-module wiring paths as compared to traditional methods where the netlists are flattened. This paper studies placing modules within a structured layout to compare resulting circuit speeds with those obtained by traditional methods. Our results indicate that the difference in critical path delay is high at very low utilisation, but that the overhead is absorbed as the number of modules and interconnection density increases to realistic levels. The authors conclude that implementing such a wiring infrastructure has manageable overheads while having the added advantage of being amenable to dynamic reconfiguration","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270338","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042460.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Communications infrastructure generation for modular FPGA reconfiguration","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9297770","htmlLink":"/document/4042460/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications infrastructure generation for modular FPGA reconfiguration","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044083S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4042462,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Kawanami","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kawanami","id":"37824463600"},{"name":"Masakazu Hioki","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Hioki","id":"37836199200"},{"name":"Yohei Matsumoto","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37828216700"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Tsutsumi","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Tsutsumi","id":"37269309600"},{"name":"Tadashi Nakagawa","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37587947800"},{"name":"Toshihiro Sekigawa","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Sekigawa","id":"37275488900"},{"name":"Hanpei Koike","affiliation":["Electroinformatics Group, Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hanpei","lastName":"Koike","id":"37269330000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9728-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9729-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4042462","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","MOSFETs","Energy consumption","Leakage current","Threshold voltage","Voltage control","Circuits","Degradation","Fabrication","Nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA bias voltage","field-programmable threshold voltage","body bias voltage set","static power reduction","deep reverse body bias"]}],"abstract":"An FPGA with field-programmable V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n components can attain both high performance and low power consumption, without placement and routing constraints, by flexibly controlling the threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) of transistors.

Bit-level estimation techniques which take into account the glitch activity in a circuit take too long to provide power estimates. In this paper we present a novel method which can provide fast estimates for the logic and intra-routing power consumption in digital circuits whilst taking into account the glitch activity but relying purely on the word-level statistics of the signals. The proposed method models the propagation of glitch activity in signals through the arithmetic components in circuits, and using this information estimates the logic and intra-routing power consumption. For arithmetic circuits implemented on FPGAs we demonstrate that previous macro-model based power estimation techniques consistently under-estimate the power consumption by up to 20 times, whilst this work can provide estimates to within a mean relative error of 30% compared to low-level power estimation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of glitch effects in FPGA based arithmetic circuits","doi":"10.1109/FPT.2006.270345","startPage":"349","endPage":"352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPT.2006.270345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042097","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4042379/4042097/04042467.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042467","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of glitch effects in FPGA based arithmetic circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042467/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9309092","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of glitch effects in FPGA based arithmetic circuits","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069672S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4042379","isNumber":"4042097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4042379","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4042097","articleId":"4042467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4042469,"authors":[{"name":"Nathaniel Couture","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada"],"firstName":"Nathaniel","lastName":"Couture","id":"37267798800"},{"name":"Kenneth B.

Using time-multiplexed I/Os eases the limitation. While, a signal path through n time-multiplexed I/Os makes the system clock period n + 1 times longer at most. To capture this feature, we introduce a new cost total cut-hopcount. Under the total cut-hopcount, we propose a performance-driven bipartitioning method VIOP. VIOP combines three algorithms, such that i) min-cut partitioning, ii) coarse performance-driven partitioning, and iii) fine performance-driven partitioning. For min-cut and coarse performance-driven partitioning, we employ well-known bipartitioning algorithms CLIP-FM and DUBA, respectively. For fine performance-driven partitioning, we propose a partitioning algorithm CAVP.

Word processing entered the American office in 1970 as an idea about reorganizing typists, but its meaning soon shifted to describe computerized text editing.

Measuring the variation of each design or fabrication parameter is infeasible from a circuit designer's perspective. Therefore, we propose a methodology that approaches PV from a test perspective. This methodology advocates testing dies for process variation by monitoring parameter variations across a die and analyzing the data that the monitoring devices provide. We use ring oscillators (ROs) to map parameter variations into the frequency domain. Our use of ROs is far more rigorous than in standard practices. To keep complexity and overhead low, we neither employ analog channels nor use zero-crossing counters. Instead, we use a frequency domain analysis because it allows compacting RO signals using digital adders (thereby also reducing the number of wires), and decoupling frequencies to identify high PVs and problematic regions. Our PV test methodology includes defining the PV fault model; deciding on types, numbers, and positions of a small distributed network of frequency-sensitive sensors (RO) and designing an efficient, fully digital communication channel with sufficient bandwidth to transfer sensor information to an analysis point. With this methodology, users can trade off cost and accuracy by choosing the number or frequency of sensors and regions on the die to monitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042505/","volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4042505/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9235737","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Testing On-Die Process Variation in Nanometer VLSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing On-Die Process Variation in Nanometer VLSI","sourcePdf":"d6438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069808S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"4042499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4042499","articleId":"4042505","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4042510,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis Sylvester","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4042499/4042510/4042510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dennis Sylvester is an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

It uses a conventional DRAM architecture except that the conventional capacitor is replaced with a new molecular capacitor. The molecular capacitor has a discrete threshold voltage, above which all molecules are charged and below which all molecules are discharged. Thus, while voltage still controls charging/discharging, the fixed charge deposited on the molecular capacitor is voltage-independent. Charge-voltage decoupling makes it possible to lower voltage from one memory generation to the next while still maintaining the minimum critical charge for reliable operation, whereas DRAM voltage scaling is constrained by charge. Voltage can be scaled inexpensively and reliably by engineering new, more favorable molecules. We analyze how three key molecule parameters influence voltage and then evaluate 23 molecules in the literature. Matching DRAM density and speed, the best molecule yields 61 percent energy savings. While the fixed charge is voltage-independent, speed is voltage-dependent. Thus, voltage is padded for competitive latency. We propose dynamically modulating the padding based on criticality of memory requests, further extending ZettaRAM's energy advantage with negligible system slowdown. Architectural management extends the best molecule's energy savings to 77 percent and extracts energy savings from six otherwise uncompetitive molecules","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4042672/04042676.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ZettaRAM: A Power-Scalable DRAM Alternative through Charge-Voltage Decoupling","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.37","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"ZettaRAM: A Power-Scalable DRAM Alternative through Charge-Voltage Decoupling","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9313818","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4042676/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ZettaRAM: A Power-Scalable DRAM Alternative through Charge-Voltage Decoupling","sourcePdf":"t0147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090268S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4042672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4042672","articleId":"4042676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4042677,"authors":[{"name":"Love Kothari","affiliation":["Intel India Limited, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4042672/4042677/4042677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Love Kothari received the BTech degree from Banaras Hindu University in 2003 and the MS degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005.

When power is removed from a chip, this charge quickly drains off, destroying any information that was contained in the chip. This causes a number of problems for computer systems, including data loss from power failures, the need to load operating systems from nonvolatile storage each time the system is powered on, and high \"idle\" power consumption due to leakage currents in memory arrays. Magnetoelectronic devices that combine ferromagnetic elements with semiconductor structures have the potential to overcome this limitation by providing high-performance nonvolatile storage that can be tightly integrated with logic. In this paper, we present the architecture of a microprocessor that uses magnetoelectronic devices to \"snapshot\" the state of the currently executing program at regular intervals. If its power supply is interrupted, this self-checkpointing microprocessor can near instantly restore its state from the last checkpoint, allowing it to resume execution with little loss of progress. Simulations of a self-checkpointing version of the Pentium 4 microprocessor show that the magnetoelectronic memories increase power consumption by only 62 mW, with little to no cost in system performance","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.21","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4042672/04042677.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture of a Self-Checkpointing Microprocessor that Incorporates Nanomagnetic Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042677/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of a Self-Checkpointing Microprocessor that Incorporates Nanomagnetic Devices","volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9313819","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4042677/","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of a Self-Checkpointing Microprocessor that Incorporates Nanomagnetic Devices","sourcePdf":"t0161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11186S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4042672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4042672","articleId":"4042677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4042679,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Paranaiba Vilela Neto","affiliation":["ICA-Research Center of Applied Computational Intelligence, Department of Engenharia El\u00e9trica, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f4lica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4042672/4042679/4042679-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omar Paranaiba Vilela Neto received the BE degree in computer engineering and the MSc degree in electrical engineering from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a new technology in the nanometer scale that has been considered as one of these alternatives. QCA have a large potential in the development of circuits with high space density and low heat dissipation and allow the development of faster computers with lower power consumption. Differently from conventional technologies, QCA do not codify information by means of electric current flow, but rather by the configuration of electrical charges in the interior of the cells. The Coulomb interaction between cells is responsible for the flow of information. This paper proposes the use of computational intelligence techniques in the simulation and in the automatic synthesis of QCA circuits. The first results show that these techniques may play an important role in this research area since they are capable of simulating efficiently and fast, synthesizing optimized circuits with a reduced number of cells. Such optimization reduces the possibility of failures and guarantees higher speed.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.33","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4042672/04042679.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Simulation and Evolutionary Synthesis of QCA Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Simulation and Evolutionary Synthesis of QCA Circuits","volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9313821","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4042679/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Simulation and Evolutionary Synthesis of QCA Circuits","sourcePdf":"t0191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092274S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4042672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4042672","articleId":"4042679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4042680,"authors":[{"name":"Zeljko Zilic","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4042672/4042680/4042680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zeljko Zilic received the PhD degree from the University of Toronto in 1997.

Both the space complexity and the asymptotic gate delay of the proposed multiplier are better than those of the best existing subquadratic space complexity parallel multipliers. For example, with n being a power of 2, the space complexity is about 8 percent better, while the asymptotic gate delay is about 33 percent better, respectively. Another advantage of the proposed matrix-vector product approach is that it can also be used to design subquadratic space complexity polynomial, dual, weakly dual, and triangular basis parallel multipliers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that subquadratic space complexity parallel multipliers are proposed for dual, weakly dual, and triangular bases. A recursive design algorithm is also proposed for efficient construction of the proposed subquadratic space complexity multipliers.

The metadata device is organized as a log-structured file system, whereas the data device is organized as groups. The new design allows DualFS not only to recover the consistency quickly after a system crash, but also to improve the overall file system performance. We have evaluated DualFS and we have found that it greatly reduces the total I/O time taken by the file system in most workloads as compared to other file systems (Ext2, Ext3, ReiserFS, XFS, and JFS).

Large collections are also precategorized into classes so that a single class contains objects of the same type (e.g., human faces, cars, four-legged animals). It is shown that general object retrieval methods are inadequate for intraclass retrieval tasks. We advocate that such intraclass problems require a specialized method that can exploit the basic class characteristics in order to achieve higher accuracy. A novel 3D object retrieval method is presented which uses a parameterized annotated model of the shape of the class objects, incorporating its main characteristics. The annotated subdivision-based model is fitted onto objects of the class using a deformable model framework, converted to a geometry image and transformed into the wavelet domain. Object retrieval takes place in the wavelet domain. The method does not require user interaction, achieves high accuracy, is efficient for use with large databases, and is suitable for nonrigid object classes. We apply our method to the face recognition domain, one of the most challenging intraclass retrieval tasks.

In this paper, we generalize photometric stereo algorithms to handle all appearances of all objects in a class, in particular the human face class, by making use of the linear Lambertian property. A linear Lambertian object is one which is linearly spanned by a set of basis objects and has a Lambertian surface. The linear property leads to a rank constraint and, consequently, a factorization of an observation matrix that consists of exemplar images of different objects (e.g., faces of different subjects) under different, unknown illuminations. Integrability and symmetry constraints are used to fully recover the subspace bases using a novel linearized algorithm that takes the varying albedo field into account. The effectiveness of the linear Lambertian property is further investigated by using it for the problem of illumination-invariant face recognition using just one image. Attached shadows are incorporated in the model by a careful treatment of the inherent nonlinearity in Lambert's law. This enables us to extend our algorithm to perform face recognition in the presence of multiple illumination sources.

Compared with existing methods, which use structuring elements, our method has three advantages. First, in our method, the time needed for computing pattern spectra does not depend on the number of scales or shapes used, i.e., the computation time is independent of the dimensions of the pattern spectrum. Second, size and strict shape attributes can be computed, which we use for the construction of joint 2D shape-size pattern spectra. Third, our method is significantly less sensitive to noise and is rotation-invariant. Although rotation invariance can also be approximated by methods using structuring elements at different angles, this tends to be computationally intensive. The classification performance of these methods is discussed using four image sets: Brodatz, COIL-20, COIL-100, and diatoms. The new method obtains better or equal classification performance to the best competitor with a 5 to 9-fold speed gain","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4042692/04042702.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connected Shape-Size Pattern Spectra for Rotation and Scale-Invariant Classification of Gray-Scale Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Shape","Filters","Filtering","Image databases","Noise shaping","Performance gain","Morphology","Image analysis","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","mathematical morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connected shape-size pattern spectra","scale-invariant classification","gray-scale image classification","multiscale morphological method","multishape morphological method","pattern-based analysis","rotation invariance","Brodatz","COIL-20","COIL-100","diatoms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mathematical morphology","connected filters","scale spaces","multiscale analysis","shape filters","rotation-invariance","diatoms","Brodatz textures","COIL-100 object library."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photometry","Rotation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Connected Shape-Size Pattern Spectra for Rotation and Scale-Invariant Classification of Gray-Scale Images","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4042702/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9258117","pubMedId":"17170480","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connected Shape-Size Pattern Spectra for Rotation and Scale-Invariant Classification of Gray-Scale Images","sourcePdf":"i0272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064617S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","isNumber":"4042692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"156","articleId":"4042702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4042703,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Ling","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4042692/4042703/4042703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibin Ling received the BS degree in mathematics and the MS degree in computer science from Peking University, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

We propose using the inner-distance to build shape descriptors that are robust to articulation and capture part structure. The inner-distance is defined as the length of the shortest path between landmark points within the shape silhouette. We show that it is articulation insensitive and more effective at capturing part structures than the Euclidean distance. This suggests that the inner-distance can be used as a replacement for the Euclidean distance to build more accurate descriptors for complex shapes, especially for those with articulated parts. In addition, texture information along the shortest path can be used to further improve shape classification. With this idea, we propose three approaches to using the inner-distance. The first method combines the inner-distance and multidimensional scaling (MDS) to build articulation invariant signatures for articulated shapes. The second method uses the inner-distance to build a new shape descriptor based on shape contexts. The third one extends the second one by considering the texture information along shortest paths. The proposed approaches have been tested on a variety of shape databases, including an articulated shape data set, MPEG7 CE-Shape-1, Kimia silhouettes, the ETH-80 data set, two leaf data sets, and a human motion silhouette data set.

One of these requirements was resolved by interleaving color information in the upper band of frequencies already apparently occupied by luminance information. Present methods employed by television receivers to separate luminance and chrominance from each other result in pictures plagued with limited horizontal resolution and distractions in the form of dot crawl and crosscolor. The frequency spectrum of video pictures in general is such that luminance information clusters around the even harmonics of one half the horizontal line scanning frequency, while color information clusters around the odd harmonics of one half the horizontal line scanning frequency. This suggests that such methods could be improved upon by the use of comb filters. The advantages and disadvantages of a combing scheme in both the receiver and transmitter will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on pictures with both high and low vertical correlation, the trade-offs in vertical resolution for a reduction in color and luminance interference effects, the higher horizontal resolution that is now possible, and the consideration of the combing scheme response in both frequency and time domain.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.1977.266898","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/4042948/04042965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.1977.266898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4042948","startPage":"248","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Thoughts on Using Comb Filters in the Broadcast Television Transmitter and at the Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4042965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Some Thoughts on Using Comb Filters in the Broadcast Television Transmitter and at the Receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4042965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"CE-23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Thoughts on Using Comb Filters in the Broadcast Television Transmitter and at the Receiver","sourcePdf":"TCE-vCE-23-n3-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061101S","chronDate":"Aug.  1977","isNumber":"4042948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4042965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4042977,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Citta","affiliation":["Zenith Radio Corporation, Glenview, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Citta","id":"37353549300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"4042977","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Phase detection","Phase frequency detector","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase noise","Voltage","Low pass filters","Circuits","Tracking loops","Signal generators"]}],"abstract":"A new electronic subsystem has been developed: The frequency and phase lock loop.

One method of attack is the use of so-called \"inverse\" digital filters. An inverse digital filter frequently has the undesirable characteristic that its memory function grows without limit with increasing time. Such inverse filters are called \"unstable.\" In the present treatment, filter stability is investigated in some detail. In particular, a digital filter of the \"minimum-delay\" type is shown to have an inverse that consists only of a stable memory function. On the other hand, a filter of the \"maximum-delay\" type has an inverse that consists only of a stable anticipation function. A filter which is neither minimum-delay nor maximum-delay, but which is of the \"mixed-delay\" type, has a stable inverse, this inverse being made up of a memory component and an anticipation component. Filters with nonvanishing anticipation components are physically nonrealizable only if one wishes them to work in real time, that is, filters functioning in real time cannot operate on future values of the input. This difficulty may be overcome by making a complete and permanent record of the entire data sequence to be analyzed prior to any filtering operation. In this manner, filters need only operate on already available input values. Any filter design allowing one to delay the output until the entire input has been recorded will thus satisfy our requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1964","publicationDate":"Nov. 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"2","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Stability of Digital Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Stability of Digital Filters","sourcePdf":"TGE-v2-n1-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040917S","chronDate":"Nov.  1964","isNumber":"4043147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4043152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043169,"authors":[{"name":"Julius Kane","affiliation":["Space Science Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Julius","lastName":"Kane","id":"38488539700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9413"}],"articleNumber":"4043169","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4043169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Capacitive sensors","Optical interferometry","Optical waveguides","Strain measurement","Interferometers","Instruments","Glass","Dielectric measurements","Optical propagation"]}],"abstract":"By use of glass fibers as dielectric waveguides, interferometric measurements of light along the propagation path can be used as a new type of strain gauge. Two novel strain interferometers are proposed: one which uses the phenomenon of crosstalk between adjacent light pipes, and another which is a waveguide version of the Michelson interferometer. Both designs are distinguished by the possibility of digital readout and a basic simplicity. The theory of the instruments is described, and explicit estimates for the strain sensitivity are calculated. The numerical data show that, with digital readout, strains of the order of 10-8 can be resolved with a basic instrument ten meters long, and strains of the order of 10-9 can be resolved by a hundred-meter device. With the aid of various refinements, the sensitivity can be enhanced by at least another order of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1966.271200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4043166/04043169.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1966.271200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber Optics and Strain Interferometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1966","displayDocTitle":"Fiber Optics and Strain Interferometry","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1966","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber Optics and Strain Interferometry","sourcePdf":"TGE-v4-n1-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061819S","chronDate":"June  1966","isNumber":"4043166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4043169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4043172,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this treatment we apply least squares Wiener theory to the design of high-resolution digital time-domain filters. Under the assumption that estimates of the seismic pulse shape are available, we present techniques that allow one to calculate digital filters which transform this pulse into one which is sufficiently sharp so that it can be distinguished against a background of noise. The two design criteria governing filter performance are filter lag and filter memory function duration. The performance of a Wiener filter is numerically measurable by a quantity which we call the filter performance parameter P, where 0 P 1. The quality of the filter output improves as P approaches unity. We thus seek that combination of lag and memory function duration that maximizes P. This goal can be accomplished by the study of a two-dimensional display of P vs. lag and memory function duration. The proposed design techniques are illustrated by means of numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1966","publicationDate":"June 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Design of High-Resolution Digital Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design of High-Resolution Digital Filters","sourcePdf":"TGE-v4-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069251S","chronDate":"June  1966","isNumber":"4043166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"106","articleId":"4043172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043201,"authors":[{"name":"Richard W.

Any spatial structure of the background noise is used by such a system to enhance the output signal-to-noise ratio. Possible areas of application include sonar, underwater communication, space communication, and seismology. The basic linear adaptive processor has variable coefficients adjusted by a rule similar to that for the minimization by the projection gradient method of a quadratic form which is subject to a linear constraint. Modifications of the basic adjustment procedure have been introduced to reduce system sensitivity to data anomalies, decrease computational requirements, and decrease memory requirements. Experimental evaluation of the adaptive array processors has been completed using data from an actual array of seismometers. Both transient recovery from initially poor processor coefficients and steady-state operation have been found quite satisfactory.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1968.271235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4043210/04043215.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1968.271235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Combining of Wideband Array Data for Optimal Reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4043215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043215/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Combining of Wideband Array Data for Optimal Reception","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Combining of Wideband Array Data for Optimal Reception","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"TGE-v6-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025798S","chronDate":"May  1968","isNumber":"4043210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4043215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4043216,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The approach genreally followed is to use inverse digital filters. This treatment presents an iterative technique for obtaining \"stable inverse digital filters.\" A stable inverse filter is one whose impulse response decays to zero with increasing time. An optimum inverse filter R() is defined here as R()=1/H(), where H()0; R()=0, where H()=0. It is shown that one can converge to this solution by operating in the time domain using the method of successive substitution. This approach to inverse filtering is unique in that the inverse filter is obtained by an iterative technique, thereby eliminating the dependence on computer limitations, as indicated in some reported techniques. In addition, a method of handling the zero crossings of H() is posed. A smoothing technique to modify these filters for inverse filtering in the presence of noise is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1968","publicationDate":"May 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"6","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Technique for Determining Inverse Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Technique for Determining Inverse Filters","sourcePdf":"TGE-v6-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047578S","chronDate":"May  1968","isNumber":"4043210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4043216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4043244,"authors":[{"name":"Johann Martinek","affiliation":["Earth Sciences Division of Teledyne Industries, Alexandria, Va. now with the U.S. Army Advanced Material Concepts Agency, Washington, D.C. 20315"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Martinek","id":"37838803600"},{"name":"Herman J.

The bibliography in its entirety is set up to provide multiple entry points into a subject area. Coverage of this bibliography is extensive but not exhaustive. It is international in scope, and spans the time period 1966-1967. The initial search was made in the 1) mathematical reviews, 2) applied mechanics reviews, and 3) geophysical reviews, as well as 4) the abstracts sections of the journals of the IEEE. In addition, indices and tables of contents of over 247 journals were scanned for further references. Only the open literature is covered, but this includes conference records, monographs, and books, as well as journal articles. The subject matter of this bibliography includes theoretical and experimental information on underwater acoustics and intimately related fields. A rather liberal policy has been followed in defining boundaries of the subject area to be included. Information specifically concerned with ocean waves and currents as well as ocean bottom topography, sedimentation, and layers has been included only to the extent that it is important to the acoustic propagation and transmission problems in the ocean and as far as it crystallizes the geometry and physical nature of the acoustic boundaries of the oceans. Papers which present new or novel combinations of old mathematical methods useful in ocean acoustics have also been included whenever it was found desirable. Soviet literature is the most heavily represented foreign literature in this survey.","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1968.271252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4043232/04043244.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1968.271252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bibliography of articles on underwater sound transmission, detection, and identification 1966-1967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1968","displayDocTitle":"Bibliography of articles on underwater sound transmission, detection, and identification 1966-1967","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1968","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bibliography of articles on underwater sound transmission, detection, and identification 1966-1967","sourcePdf":"TGE-v6-n4-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037515S","chronDate":"Nov.  1968","isNumber":"4043232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","articleId":"4043244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043260,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is pointed out that scattering of sound by the atmosphere is produced by temperature and wind fluctuations, but that only temperature variations produce backscatter. Concepts for using the acoustic radar to measure profiles of temperature, wind, and humidity are discussed. A technique for measuring humidity profile using the relationship between attenuation of sound and absolute humidity is described. Design of the acoustic radar components is discussed with particular emphasis given to the problem of the antenna design. Some of the results of eight months of operation of the system are discussed. One case in which the acoustic radar was able to detect the passage of a thermal structure discontinuity not detectable by conventional observational and analysis techniques is described. It is concluded that the analog form of the data has great potential usefulness for continuously monitoring the thermal structure of the lower troposphere. Further measurement of wind and humidity profiles, and perhaps also the temperature profile to heights of a few thousand feet by means of the acoustic radar, seems feasible if the signal-to-noise ratio in the present system can be improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1972","publicationDate":"Jan. 1972","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Design and Operation of an Acoustic Radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design and Operation of an Acoustic Radar","sourcePdf":"TGE-v10-n1-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026304S","chronDate":"Jan.  1972","isNumber":"4043249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4043260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043269,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

This technique, which is particularly well suited to surveys from moving vehicles, utilizes an inertial navigation system, a geodetic position and velocity reference, and an optimal data smoother. An inertial navigation system inherently indicates the astronomic vertical so that vertical deflections cause errors in indicated geodetic position and velocity. This error is measured using an external geodetic position reference (such as LORAN) and a velocity reference. These measurements are then processed by a smoother to recover the vertical deflections. The particular smoother used is the so-called Kalman smoother which treats all of the error sources including vertical deflections as random processes. Both analytic studies are performed and real data from midocean areas are processed. These studies show that if a high-quality inertial system is used in conjunction with a geodetic position reference of accuracy 0.1 nmi rms, vertical deflections of magnitude 10-30 rms can be estimated to within 5-8 rms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4043266/04043269.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1972.271273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1972.271273","startPage":"85","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Recovery of Deflections of the Vertical Using an Inertial Navigator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043269/","displayDocTitle":"Direct Recovery of Deflections of the Vertical Using an Inertial Navigator","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"April 1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Recovery of Deflections of the Vertical Using an Inertial Navigator","sourcePdf":"TGE-v10-n2-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088266S","chronDate":"April  1972","isNumber":"4043266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"21","articleId":"4043269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043272,"authors":[{"name":"Robert E.

The first step to reduce sulfur dioxide levels was taken by Governor Hughes of New Jersey, who requested and received reports from the electric generating companies detailing their plans to lower emission of sulfur dioxide and particulates. Power plants operated by these companies are major sources of both forms of pollution. Much of the reduction in sulfur dioxide between the years 1966 and 1967 must be credited to the efforts of the Governor and the utilities. The New Jersey Air Pollution Control Program developed new codes designed to reduce emissions by limiting the amount of sulfur permitted to be burned in fuel oils and coal. The effective date of hese codes was May, 1968. The code for oils has been in effect since that time but the coal code has been held in abeyance pending the results of a suit filed against the code by coal and railroad companies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"7","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control of Air Pollution through Process of Law","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Air Pollution through Process of Law","sourcePdf":"TGE-v7-n4-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028902S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4043342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","articleId":"4043350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043352,"authors":[{"name":"Eric J.

In addition, new data from the Cornell Family Illness Study are used to draw a picture of the complex interactions that exist between man and his environment. Certain conclusions are drawn: 1) air pollution has definite but varying adverse effects upon health; 2) no single pollutant appears solely responsible for the effects; 3) the effects seem to come from the totality of the atmospheric environment with weather and season playing their part; 4) the effects are influenced by variations in individual habits and disease as well as by certain social determinants. A control philosophy based upon process control is described suggesting the control of emissions to the greatest extent feasible, employing the maximum technological capability. A parallel is drawn between the public health advances necessary in the past to allow the growth of the cities and the need for pollution control to allow the continued growth of technology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4043135/4043342/04043352.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGE.1969.271355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGE.1969.271355","startPage":"220","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Air Pollution-The Relationship between Health Effects and Control Philosophy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043352/","displayDocTitle":"Air Pollution-The Relationship between Health Effects and Control Philosophy","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air Pollution-The Relationship between Health Effects and Control Philosophy","sourcePdf":"TGE-v7-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026341S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4043342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","articleId":"4043352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043356,"authors":[{"name":"Phan Cong Luan","affiliation":["Laval University, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Phan Cong","lastName":"Luan"},{"name":"Jan B.

The SNAP-19 consists of two generators, two dc-dc converters, and a telemetry signal conditioning unit. Power is produced by converting the radioactive heat of decay of the isotope Pu-238 in a static thermopile consisting of 90 PbTe 2n-3p couples per generator.

In many instances the dimensions of these matrices are so large that their implementation as ordinary planar convolutional filters becomes computationally inefficient. It is possible to expand the given coefficient matrix into a finite and convergent sum of matrix-valued stages. Each stage can be separated with no error into the product of an m-length column vector multiplied into an n-length row vector, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns of the original filter array. Substantial savings in computer storage and speed result if the given filter array can be represented with a tolerably small error by the first few stages of the expansion. Since each constituent stage consists of two vector-valued factors, further computational economies accrue if the one-dimensional sequences described by these vectors are in turn approximated by one-dimensional recursive filters. Two geophysical examples have been selected to illustrate how the present design techniques may be reduced to practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1971","publicationDate":"Jan. 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"9","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Design of Multistage Separable Planar Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design of Multistage Separable Planar Filters","sourcePdf":"TGE-v9-n1-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054788S","chronDate":"Jan.  1971","isNumber":"4043443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"117","articleId":"4043447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4043451,"authors":[{"name":"Albert W.

The FM signal must be interrupted periodically to permit both transmitting and receiving with a single antenna. An ionosonde of this type has been constructed and operated. The monostatic FM sounder radiates a peak power of 8 W and sweeps the frequency range of 0.5 to 30 MHz either linearly or logarithmically. Records from the FM ionosonde are comparable in time delay resolution, S/N, and overall quality to conventional pulse ionograms; the effects of interference from other HF users is somewhat less conspicuous on the FM sounder records.

Preand post-flight calibrations of the infrared spectrometer were performed both by using polished samples of \"standard\" rocks (quartz diorite and gabbro) as well as the more familiar blackbody radiance standards. From these latter spectra the instrument transfer function (A\u03c4\u03bb) was derived. In-flight calibrations of wavelength were achieved by the rapid insertion and removal of a polystyrene film in the optical train of the spectrometer, as polystyrene is a material whose transmission spectrum is constant and well known. By flying over a body of water (\u03f56.7-13.3\u03bcm = 0.98) and recording the radiance spectrum of that target one can determine the transmission spectrum of the atmospheric path between the aircraft and the water (at least to a first approximation) as both the spectral emittance of lake water and the optical transfer functions of the instrument are known or can be calculated. So far, flights have been made only at low altitudes (2000 ft above the lake), with the lake surface at 2000 ft (near Pisgah Crater, S. Calif.) or 6000 ft (Mono Lake, E. Calif.) above sea level.

The speckled nature of usual single-frequency radar images may be reduced by averaging in azimuth and by averaging in range or transmitting excess range bandwidth. With synthetic aperture systems, averaging is possible in both range and azimuth, but only range averaging (excess bandwidth) is reasonable with most real-aperture systems. Multispectral sensing appears to offer advantages for radar comparable with those for photography, on the basis of experimental spectral response curves. Matching the transfer characteristics of receiver, recorder, and film is necessary to achieve quality images. Special techniques may be necessary to permit discriminating targets of similar radar return while at the same time allowing for the very wide total range of returns. The calibration necessary to achieve repeatable results and permit use of automatic data processing may be obtained by inserting a stepped sample of transmitter signal into the receiver to place calibration blocks on the image. Both multiple look-angle coverage with a single flight line and stereo can be achieved by use of fore-and-aft squinted antennas for alternate transmissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043481/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1971","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1971","publicationDate":"July 1971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","volume":"9","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Imaging Radars for Geoscience Use","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging Radars for Geoscience Use","sourcePdf":"TGE-v9-n3-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052452S","chronDate":"July  1971","isNumber":"4043472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4043135","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4043481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4043496,"authors":[{"name":"Calvin C.

Calculations on the parametric oscillation effect show that a one watt blue or UV laser can effectively provide the optical pumping which would result in a very appreciable tunable optical output over the visible spectrum.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lasers and Their Application to Television Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/TBC.1967.265870","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4043567/04043570.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.1967.265870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4043567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4043570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4043570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Lasers and Their Application to Television Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"BC-13","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lasers and Their Application to Television Systems","sourcePdf":"TBC-vBC-13-n1-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040063S","chronDate":"Jan.  1967","isNumber":"4043567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","articleId":"4043570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4043730,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

At low output levels, the first PA operates linearly, reaching saturation (and maximum efficiency) at some transition voltage below the system peak-output voltage. At higher output levels, the first PA remains saturated and the second PA operates linearly. The instantaneous efficiency and power characteristics of a Doherty system are derived using ideal class-B RF PAs so that the results can easily be scaled for use with real-world PAs. The average efficiency and maximum-efficiency transition points are then determined for a variety of amplitude-modulated signals. The Doherty amplifier can be considerably more efficient than a conventional class-B linear PA. For example, the 28-and 8.9-percent average efficiencies of a class-B PA with Rayleigh-distri buted envelopes with 10-and 20-dB peak-to-average ratios are improved to 60 and 48 percent, respectively, by a two-stage Doherty system.

Spatial splitting of the picture is employed to increase the aspect ratio. A low cost HDTV system is also presented that uses a modulated-signal combination. With this system, considerable simplification is possible with a slight reduction in resolution.

Existing NTSC receivers display a selected 4: 3 portion of the widescreen image with standard NTSC resolution. However, a new widescreen receiver, tuned to the same 6-MHz RF channel, displays a widescreen image with a resolution in excess of 400 lines/picture height in both spatial dimensions. To produce the NTSC-compatible signal, the original widescreen high-definition signal is separated into four components: (1) the main NTSC signal with the side panel low frequencies time compressed into the horizontal overscan regions, (2) the time-expanded side panel high frequencies, (3) the extended horizontal-luminance detail, and (4) the extended vertical-temporal luminance detail. Components 2 and 3 are quadrature modulated at low amplitude by a new phase-controlled subcarrier at 3.1 MHz. Component 4 is inserted in quadrature with the RF picture carrier. This paper discusses how the four components are processed to insure full compatibility at the NTSC receiver and complete recoverability at the ACTV receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.1987.266646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4044491/04044499.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.1987.266646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4044491","startPage":"116","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding for Compatibility and Recoverability in the ACTV System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4044499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Encoding for Compatibility and Recoverability in the ACTV System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4044499/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"BC-33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding for Compatibility and Recoverability in the ACTV System","sourcePdf":"TBC-vBC-33-n4-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039813S","chronDate":"Dec.  1987","isNumber":"4044491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4044499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4044501,"authors":[{"name":"Yuichi Ninomiya","affiliation":["Science and Technical Research Laboratories, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Ninomiya","id":"37347677000"},{"name":"Yoshimichi Ohtsuka","affiliation":["Science and Technical Research Laboratories, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshimichi","lastName":"Ohtsuka","id":"37425829600"},{"name":"Yoshinori Izumi","affiliation":["Science and Technical Research Laboratories, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinori","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37606994200"},{"name":"Seiichi Gohshi","affiliation":["Science and Technical Research Laboratories, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Gohshi","id":"37567823100"},{"name":"Yuichi Iwadate","affiliation":["Science and Technical Research Laboratories, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Iwadate","id":"37828321400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"4044501","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":22,"totalDownloads":103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"abstract":"An HDTV broadcasting service on one satellite broadcast channel became available after the development of a transmission system called MUSE involving bandwidth compression.

These systems consist of an array of sensors (antennas, hydrophones, seismometers, etc.,) the outputs of which are combined in a processor to give an output which is optimal under the particular performance criteria of interest. Such systems allow the separation of a desired signal from a background of both directional and isotropic interference. For wide bandwidth signals these processors generally consist of linear filters, which for implementation purposes are approximated by tapped delay lines in each channel of the array. For the relatively narrowband problems being addressed by this paper (such as those concerned with jam resistant r-f radar and communications systems) these processors consist of complex weights in each channel (or in-phase and quadrature channels). Two types of arrays have proven useful in different applications. The conventional array as illustrated in Fig. 1 and the signal aligned array as shown in Fig. 2 where direction of arrival information is used to co-phase the desired signal in each channel.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1971.271064","publicationTitle":"1971 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"1971 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4044696/4044697/04044825.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1971.271064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4044697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance criteria for narrowband array processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4044825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 1971","displayDocTitle":"Performance criteria for narrowband array processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1971","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1971","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance criteria for narrowband array processing","confLoc":"Miami Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1971010-01dec-0564bair.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033964S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 1971","isNumber":"4044697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4044696","citationCount":"36","articleId":"4044825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4044835,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang Yun Lee","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kwang Yun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407649100"},{"name":"Robert O.

The output of each channel is time integrated for 10 ms, and log mapped. An utterance is represented by a succession of points (a new point is generated every 10 ms) in the 6- dimensional space defined by the 6 octave bands. Reference points are scattered throughout the space. Each time interval is assigned the label of the nearest reference point. We call the resulting string of labels a \"character string\". Encoding an utterance into a character string may proceed with an arbitrary degree of precision, greater resolution resulting from the use of more reference points. Only 24 reference points are needed to achieve 98% correct recognition scores for 54 words in near real time. String generation techniques are explored. Several learning schemes based on character strings are described.

Among the stepsize rules considered are: constant stepsize, minimization along a line, Goldstein-Armijo rules, and stepsize equal to minimum of certain interpolatory polynomials. One of the major results shown is that the rate of convergence of descent methods with the Goldstein-Armijo stepsize rule can be made as close as desired to the rate of convergence of methods that require minimization along a line. Also, a descent algorithm that combines a Goldstein-Armijo stepsize rule with a secant-type step is presented. It is shown that this algorithm has a convergence rate equal to the convergence of descent methods that require minimization along a line and that, eventually (i.e. near the minimum), it does not require a search to determine an acceptable stepsize.","displayPublicationTitle":"1973 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 12th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","pdfPath":"/iel5/4045030/4045031/04045114.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"1973 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 12th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1973.269201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1973.269201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4045031","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4045114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stepsize analysis for descent methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Variable speed drives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4045114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Dec. 1973","displayDocTitle":"Stepsize analysis for descent methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1973","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stepsize analysis for descent methods","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1973012-01dec-0417cohe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.012495S","chronDate":"5-7 Dec. 1973","isNumber":"4045031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4045030","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4045114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4045139,"authors":[{"name":"H.

When measurements from each sensor are statistically independent, the data compression method is shown to be computationally most efficient, followed by the sequential processing; the parallel processing is least efficient.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1976.267794","publicationTitle":"1976 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 15th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","startPage":"570","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1976.267794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4045550","pdfPath":"/iel5/4045549/4045550/04045654.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1976 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 15th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Laboratories","Nonlinear filters","Q measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Kalman filter algorithms for a multi-sensor system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4045654/","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1976","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman filter algorithms for a multi-sensor system","confLoc":"Clearwater, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1976015-01dec-0570will.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.014529S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 1976","isNumber":"4045550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4045549","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4045654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4045712,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Recently we have shown how a certain shift invariance inherent in many estimation and control problems can be exploited to obtain fast algorithms that often require orders of magnitude less computations than presently available methods to compute optimal gains. We have developped fast algorithms for a variety of presently available identification methods as well as new ones that require computer time and storage (or hardware) per measurement only proportional to the number of model parameters, compared to the square of the number of parameters for previous methods. Since parameter identification can be formulated as a state estimation problem, optimal filtering results can be applied.

A rigorous mathematical theory is developed for general (i.e., non-necessary finite) sample sets in order to allow for future studies of an statistical nature relating the classification of a general set with that of its finite samples. The theory is presented in two major steps. The first step deals with the formalization of the concept of cluster. Unlike previous approaches which defined clusters as the fuzzy sets obtained as a result of the application of an algorithmic procedure (frequently based on an optimization goal) to the sample set, in this work clusters are characterized as fuzzy subsets which must satisfy certain conditions (independent of the classification goals being pursued) in order to qualify as potential taxonomical elements. The qualifying conditions are expressed as fuzzy relational equations derived extending simple relational equations in the conventional set domain. The problems in making such transition are discussed. Conditions for existence of fuzzy classifications are derived in terms of a class of fuzzy resemblance relations, called \"likeness\" relations. These conditions are shown to be much less restrictive than the corresponding conditions for the conventional case. In addition, the resulting cluster families provide richer representations of the underlying taxonomical structures. The problem of likeness relation derivation is analyzed from several viewpoints. The second step in this theoretical development deals with the problem of optimal representation of a sample set as a union of clusters. Using again the procedure of extending conventional set formulations, it is shown that approaches based on the minimization of functionals defined over all possible cluster representations, which satisfy certain desirable properties, must necessarily optimize one member of a uniparametric functional family. It is also shown that the extension of conventional concepts to the fuzzy domain provides a generalization of the concept of a number of clusters (which is no longer required to be an integer) and of \"prototype element\" of a cluster.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1977.271519","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1383","displayPublicationTitle":"1977 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 16th Symposium on Adaptive Processes and A Special Symposium on Fuzzy Set Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4045799/4045800/04046053.pdf","publicationTitle":"1977 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 16th Symposium on Adaptive Processes and A Special Symposium on Fuzzy Set Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1977.271519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4045800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A theory of fuzzy clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy sets","Equations","Prototypes","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy set theory","Clustering algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4046053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 1977","displayDocTitle":"A theory of fuzzy clustering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theory of fuzzy clustering","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1977016-01dec-1378rusp.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021114S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 1977","isNumber":"4045800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4045799","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4046053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4046056,"authors":[{"name":"Theodosios Pavlidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Theodosios","lastName":"Pavlidis","id":"37320092900"},{"name":"Robin L.

These provide a generalization of the scalar frequency-domain notions such as gain, bandwidth, stability margins and M-circles, and provide considerable insight into system robustness.","publicationTitle":"1978 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 17th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","displayPublicationTitle":"1978 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the 17th Symposium on Adaptive Processes","pdfPath":"/iel5/4046065/4046066/04046072.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"18","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1978.267885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1978.267885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4046066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness of multiloop linear feedback systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4046072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 1979","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of multiloop linear feedback systems","publicationDate":"Jan. 1978","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of multiloop linear feedback systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1978017-01jan-0012doyl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019856S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 1979","isNumber":"4046066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4046065","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4046072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4046215,"authors":[{"name":"Donald E.

Besides their interesting connections to stability and scattering theory, partial correlations and matrix square-roots, they also seem to have well behaved numerical properties. Ladder forms seem to be a \"natural\" form for Wiener (or whitening) filters due to the fact that the optimal whitening filter is time-varying (even for stationary processes), except for ladder form coefficients, which are constants \"switched on\" at the appropriate time. This leads to the fact that this parametrization is very well suited for tracking rapidly varying sources. Compared to gradient type techniques, our exact least-squares ladder recursions have only a slightly increased number of operations. This increase is due to the recursively computed likelihood variables which act as optimal gains on the data, enabling the ladder filter to lock rapidly on to a transient. Several ladder form applications will be briefly discussed, such as speech modeling, \"zero startup\" equalisers, and \"noise cancelling and inversion\".

The main reason is that LQG theory offers a handy design tool but the numerical value of the quadratic performance index lacks practical significance. A new approach to control structure synthesis using a frequency domain description of the system is suggested here. The screening of alternate control structures is carried out in two stages. At the first stage the fundamental limitations to control quality, which are shown to be RHP transmission zeroes and time delays, are identified and preliminary control structure selection is made. In the second stage the performance of the remaining systems is compared when they are robust with respect to a prespecified model-plant mismatch. The intuitive appeal of this screening procedure should make it attractive for industrial applications. Some features of this new method are illustrated on a heat exchanger network and a distillation column.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency domain approach to control structure synthesis","publicationTitle":"1981 20th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the Symposium on Adaptive Processes","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1981.269569","displayPublicationTitle":"1981 20th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control including the Symposium on Adaptive Processes","pdfPath":"/iel5/4046870/4046871/04046977.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1981.269569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4046871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4046977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4046977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 1981","displayDocTitle":"A frequency domain approach to control structure synthesis","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency domain approach to control structure synthesis","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1981020-01dec-0478mora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02565S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 1981","isNumber":"4046871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4046870","citationCount":"623","articleId":"4046977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4046984,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A preliminary theoretical study is conducted so as to determine a large set of stable and robust controls for non-linear systems whose equations encompass the dynamic equations of any rigid manipulator. Sufficient conditions for obtaining a good tracking of a linear time-invariant model of reference are derived. The local stability of several well known control methods is rigourously established while it is shown that global stability requires the use of non-linear gains in the control expression. An interesting property is that the determination of such gains does not necessarily require an important knowledge of the system; which justifies the use of very simple control schemes in practice. However, a control better conditioned with respect to measurement noises is obtained when a good model of the system is used in the control derivation. Between these two alternatives lies the idea of using adjustable control gains that become large when needed and stay small otherwise. In light of this study, several control schemes proposed in the literature on the subject (including adaptive control schemes) are discussed and conclusions are drawn with a view to future studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4047747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"- Dec. 1983","publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","conferenceDate":"Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust non linear control of robotic manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust non linear control of robotic manipulators","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1983022-01dec-1211sams.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042623S","chronDate":"- Dec. 1983","isNumber":"4047491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4047490","citationCount":"31","articleId":"4047747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4047772,"authors":[{"name":"Rajendra Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37272667200"}],"articleNumber":"4047772","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Adaptive equalizers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4047772","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1983.269741","publicationTitle":"The 22nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","abstract":"An adaptive decision directed equalizer, wherein the estimates of the transmitted data are used for the adaptation of the equalizer parameters, is analyzed.

Based on extensive analytical and experimental studies, realistic robot dynamic models are presented that have been validated over the frequency range 0 to 50 Hz. These models exhibit a strong influence of drive system flexibility, producing lightly damped poles in the neighborhood of 8 Hz, 14 Hz, and 40 Hz, all unmodeled by the conventional rigid body multiple link robot dynamic approach. The models presented also quantify the significance of nonlinearities in the drive system, in addition to those well-known in the linkage itself. Realistic simulations of robot dynamics and motion controls demonstrate that existing controls coupled with effective path planning produce dynamic path errors that are acceptable for most manufacturing applications. Major benefits are projected, with examples cited, for use of end-effector sensors for position, force, and process control that compensate for uncertainties encountered on the factory floor.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4047817/4047818/04047981.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4047818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1984.272105","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1984.272105","displayPublicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4047981","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot motion","Motion control","Robot control","Control systems","Robot sensing systems","Service robots","Virtual manufacturing","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Pulp manufacturing","Uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4047981/","displayDocTitle":"Re-definition of the robot motion control problem: Effects of plant dynamics, drive system constraints, and user requirements","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Re-definition of the robot motion control problem: Effects of plant dynamics, drive system constraints, and user requirements","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1984023-01dec-0724swee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026959S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","isNumber":"4047818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4047817","citationCount":"89","articleId":"4047981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4047982,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Koditschek","affiliation":["Center of Systems Science Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Koditschek","id":"37275653000"}],"articleNumber":"4047982","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Manipulators","State feedback","Motion control","Control systems","Three-term control","Filters","Jacobian matrices","Kinematics","Stacking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4047982","abstract":"This paper describes some initial steps toward the development of more natural control strategies for free motion of robot arms.

It is assumed that those dynamic systems can be operated repeatedly at low cost and in a relatively short time under invariant initial physical conditions, but the knowledge on precise description of their dynamics is not required. The betterment process is composed of a simple iteration rule that generates autonomously a present actuator input better than the previous one, provided a desired output response is given. The convergence of iteration is proved for a simple betterment process where the k+1th input is composed of the kth input plus an increment of the derivative error between the kth output response and given desired response. Discussions on potential applications of the proposed theory to controlling robots or other mechanical systems are presented together with future subjects to be investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4048052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bettering operation of dynamic systems by learning: A new control theory for servomechanism or mechatronics systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bettering operation of dynamic systems by learning: A new control theory for servomechanism or mechatronics systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1984023-01dec-1064arim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031493S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 1984","isNumber":"4047818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4047817","citationCount":"145","articleId":"4048052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4048055,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Verdu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verdu","id":"37274351500"},{"name":"H.

The algorithm is derived from the Newton-Euler equations, and uses measurements of the joint torques as well as the measurement and calculation of the kinematics of the manipulator while it is moving. The identification equations are linear in the desired unknown parameters, and a modified least squares algorithm is used to obtain estimates of these parameters. Some of the parameters, however, are not identifiable due to the restricted motion of proximal links and the lack of full force/torque sensing. The algorithm was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was obtained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques computed from motor currents.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1985.268648","startPage":"990","endPage":"995","publicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1985.268648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4048221","displayPublicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4048220/4048221/04048448.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of inertial parameters of rigid body links of manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4048448/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of inertial parameters of rigid body links of manipulators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of inertial parameters of rigid body links of manipulators","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1985024-01dec-0990an.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041405S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","isNumber":"4048221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4048220","citationCount":"125","articleId":"4048448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4048449,"authors":[{"name":"Chirstopher G.

In their pure form they modify the dual variables (node prices) one at a time using only local node information while aiming to improve the dual cost. They are particularly well suited for distributed implementation on massively parallel machine. For problems with strictly convex arc costs they can be shown to converge even if relaxation at each node is carried out asynchronously with out-of-date price information from neighboring nodes [1]. For problems with linear arc costs relaxation methods have outperformed by a substantial margin the classical primal simplex and primal-dual methods on standard benchmark problems [2], [3]. However in these particular methods it is necessary to change sometimes the prices of several nodes as a group in addition to carrying out pure relaxation steps. As a result global node price information is needed occasionally, and distributed implementation becomes somewhat complicated. In this paper we describe a distributed algorithm for solving the classical linear cost assignment problem. It employs exclusively pure relaxation steps whereby the prices of sources and sinks are changed individually on the basis of only local (neighbor) node price information. The algorithm can be implemented in an asynchronous (chaotic) manner, and seems quite efficient for problems with a small arc cost range. It has an interesting interpretation as an auction where economic agents compete for resources by making successively higher bids.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1985.268826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1985.268826","publicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4048220/4048221/04048607.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4048221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed asynchronous relaxation algorithm for the assignment problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4048607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","displayDocTitle":"A distributed asynchronous relaxation algorithm for the assignment problem","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed asynchronous relaxation algorithm for the assignment problem","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1985024-01dec-1703bert.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036685S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","isNumber":"4048221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4048220","citationCount":"27","articleId":"4048607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4048619,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep K.

This paper presents effective design methods for articulated direct-drive arms. A new approach is developed for arm linkage design. The goal is to simplify the controller design by reducing the effects of complicated manipulator dynamics and to improve the control performance. A method for designing an arm linkage with small inertial load changes and small interactive forces is developed by analyzing the kinematic structure, actuator locations and the mass properties. This design methodology achieves a decoupled and invariant manipulator inertia tensor in joint space. As a result, each actuator experiences completely decoupled dynamics as well as a constant load which is independent of the arm configuration. This dynamic behavior is particularly desirable for manipulators performing high-speed high-accuracy trajectory control tasks. These design guidelines are applied in the development of the articulated 3 d.o.f M.I.T direct-drive arm. The manipulator, with a decoupled and nearly invariant arm inertia tensor, shows a substantial improvement in control performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4048220/4048221/04048686.pdf","startPage":"2052","endPage":"2058","publicationTitle":"1985 24th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1985.268564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1985.268564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4048221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4048686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic decoupling and control of a direct-drive manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Tensile stress","Couplings","Guidelines","Sampling methods","Robots","Laboratories","Hydraulic actuators","Arm","Performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4048686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic decoupling and control of a direct-drive manipulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic decoupling and control of a direct-drive manipulator","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1985024-01dec-2052youc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025266S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 1985","isNumber":"4048221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4048220","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4048686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4048704,"authors":[{"name":"Seth R.

This results in considerable simplification of the problem. We also discuss the case where the messages may take more than two values and the case of M-ary (M > 2) hypotheses. Next we consider two variants of a decentralized sequential detection problem.

In contrast, a memoryless linear transformation on the matched filter outputs of the receiver is proposed, which is shown to guarantee a high lower bound on the asymptotic efficiency, which is independent of signal energies, while the time-complexity per bit is linear in the number of users.

The problem as formulated is particularly interesting and challenging because the uncertainty is large and highly structured.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space shuttles","Uncertainty","Aerospace control","Aerodynamics","Aerospace electronics","Aircraft","Optimal control","Robust control","Performance analysis","Robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.1986.267482","publicationTitle":"1986 25th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 25th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4048689/4048690/04049203.pdf","startPage":"2218","endPage":"2223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4048690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1986.267482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design examples using \u00b5-synthesis: Space shuttle lateral axis FCS during reentry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design examples using \u00b5-synthesis: Space shuttle lateral axis FCS during reentry","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049203/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design examples using \u00b5-synthesis: Space shuttle lateral axis FCS during reentry","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1986025-01dec-2218doyl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030683S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 1986","isNumber":"4048690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4048689","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4049203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4049222,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

In these cases the problem is characterized as a quasi-static bifurcation occuring in response to a slowly varying increase or decrease in load. However, dynamic load characteristics have long been known to have an effect on system stability and in fact, assumptions about the load model will significantly affect any predictions. In this paper, we discuss voltage stabilities as a function of loads. We investigate the stability characteristics of a basic configuration consisting of a generator, an induction motor load, and a static load. Using an aggregated steady-state equivalent circuit representation for the induction motor, we derive a motor torque-slip differential equation. We show that when induction motor charactestics are incorporated the voltage stability region is smaller than that defined by Venikov's steady-state stability limits [1]. We also present an example of a voltage collapse using the induction motor torque-slip differential equation that is different from those described before.","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4049207/4049208/04049222.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1987.272690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1987.272690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic voltage instability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Induction motors","Circuit stability","Steady-state","Differential equations","Jacobian matrices","Bifurcation","Load modeling","Predictive models","Induction generators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic voltage instability","isConference":true,"volume":"26","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic voltage instability","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1987026-01dec-0053thom.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02198S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","isNumber":"4049208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4049207","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4049222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4049321,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur J.

It provides guidance for the development of algorithms for real-time decision-making in a manufacturing enterprise in which such disruptive events as machine failures, material absences, expedited items, engineering changes, fluctuations of demand, and setups play a role. The hierarchy is divided into a set of levels that correspond to events that occur at very different frequencies. At each level, decisions are made in a way that satisfies the capacity constraints that are appropriate to that level and that meets objectives determined at higher levels. These decisions are either actions, such as the loading of a part or the initiation of a setup, or objectives to be issued to lower levels. The application of the scheduling hierarchy to a simple, two-machine manufacturing system is presented. The goal is to meet a specified production plan as closely as possible. The scheduler must compensate for random failures, and must choose times to initiate set-ups and load parts.

In addition, the frequency response technique can be used to evaluate the impact of the controllers on the stability of unmodeled dynamics and the damping improvement when the system operating condition changes. Insights obtained from such a frequency response analysis are useful for the design of robust controllers.

Only such failures that manifest themselves as abrupt variations in the coefficients of the system governing differential equations are considered. The local and global failure detectabilities of different system variables are defined. Based on these definitions, the paper shows that instantaneous failure detection is possible only by observing the failure-induced jumps in some continuous system variables under the noise-free conditions. If noise is present, a robust way of failure detection is to average the observed variables before making any decisions. Consequently, a residual-based failure detection scheme is derived. It comprises essentially a hypothesis testing on the mean of the window-averaged residuals between the output of the system and that of the model. After the possible occurrence of the failure being detected, under the noise-free conditions, the failure location can be traced in terms of the changed coefficients of the system differential equations by simply solving a set of linear algebraic equations in the discrete domain. If the data are noisy, least-squares type of algorithms can be used to increase the robustness of the failure localization. Two examples of continuous systems subject to possible failures are simulated to demonstrate the direct and residual-based failure detection schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1987.272596","startPage":"1174","endPage":"1179","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1987.272596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049208","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4049207/4049208/04049473.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure detection and localization in linear continuous dynamical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049473/","displayDocTitle":"Failure detection and localization in linear continuous dynamical systems","isConference":true,"volume":"26","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure detection and localization in linear continuous dynamical systems","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1987026-01dec-1174jian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068105S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","isNumber":"4049208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4049207","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4049473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4049513,"authors":[{"name":"Bronislaw Jakubczyk","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland","Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Bronislaw","lastName":"Jakubczyk","id":"37827460500"},{"name":"Eduardo D.

It consists of three stages of mapping design: (data) dependence graph (DG) design, signal flow graph (SFG) design, and array processor design. This methodology allows systolic design with many desirable properties, such as local communication and fastest pipelin rates, etc. Based on this methodology, we shall develop systolic array designs for two important applications of adaptive state-space models. One is for the Kalman filtering algorithm which is popular in many digital signal processing applications. The other one is the Hopfield model for artificial neural network (ANN), which has recently received increasing attention from AI and parallel processing research community.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1987.272654","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1467","publicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1987.272654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049208","displayPublicationTitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4049207/4049208/04049531.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic designs for state space models: Kalman filtering and neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049531/","displayDocTitle":"Systolic designs for state space models: Kalman filtering and neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"26","publicationDate":"Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic designs for state space models: Kalman filtering and neural network","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"css-cdc-1987026-01dec-1461kung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034727S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 1987","isNumber":"4049208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4049207","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4049531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4049577,"authors":[{"name":"Jan C.

This human-oriented approach based on offline analysis of the raw images is highly subjective and prone to error because of the exorbitant amount of data to be assessed. Laser profilers have been recently proposed to project well-defined light patterns, improving the illumination of standard CCTV systems as well as enhancing the capability of automating the assessment process. This research shows that positional (geometrical) as well as intensity information, related to potential defects, can be extracted from the acquired laser projections. While most researchers focus on the analysis of positional information obtained from the acquired profiler signals, here the intensity information contained within the reflected light is also exploited for the purpose of defect classification and visualization. This paper describes novel strategies created for the automation of defect classification in tubular structures and explores new methods to fuse intensity and positional information, achieving improved multivariable defect classification. The acquired camera/laser images are processed in order to extract signal information for the purpose of visualization and map creation for further assessment. Then, a two-stage approach based on image processing and artificial neural networks is used to classify the images. First, a binary classifier identifies defective pipe sections, and then in a second stage, the defects are classified into different types, such as holes, cracks, and protruding obstacles. Experimental results are provided. Note to Practitioners-The method presented in this paper aims to automate the inspection of nonaccessible pipe surfaces. The method was thought to be employed in the inspection of sewers; however, it could be used in many other industrial applications and could also be extended to other shapes rather than tubular structures. A laser ring profiler, consisting, for instance, of a laser diode and a ring projector, can be easily integrated into existing closed-circuit television systems. The proposed algorithm identifies defective areas and categorizes the types of defects, analyzing the successive recorded camera images that will contain the reflected ring of light. The algorithm, that can be used online, makes use of the deformation of the reflected laser ring together with its changes in intensity. The fact of combining the two kinds of data using artificial-intelligent algorithms makes the method robust enough to work in harsh environments","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2006.873225","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4049758/04049765.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2006.873225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Pipe Defect Detection and Categorization Using Camera/Laser-Based Profiler and Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Automated Pipe Defect Detection and Categorization Using Camera/Laser-Based Profiler and Artificial Neural Network","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9258283","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4049765/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Pipe Defect Detection and Categorization Using Camera/Laser-Based Profiler and Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"04tase01-duran-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129068S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4049758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4049758","articleId":"4049765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4049774,"authors":[{"name":"Sivakumar Rathinam","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sivakumar","lastName":"Rathinam","id":"37268809800"},{"name":"Raja Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Raja","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"37268807800"},{"name":"Swaroop Darbha","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Swaroop","lastName":"Darbha","id":"37282703100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"4049774","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Approximation algorithms","Surveillance","Fires","Monitoring","Mobile robots","Aircraft","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","travelling salesman problems","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation algorithm","multivehicle systems","nonholonomic constraints","yaw rate constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative control","Dubins","motion planning","nonholonomic","traveling salesman","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resource Allocation Algorithm for Multivehicle Systems With Nonholonomic Constraints","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2006.872110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049758","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4049758/04049774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2006.872110","startPage":"98","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049774","abstract":"This paper is about the allocation of tours of m targets to n vehicles. The motion of the vehicles satisfies a nonholonomic constraint (i.e., the yaw rate of the vehicle is bounded). Each target is to be visited by one and only one vehicle. Given a set of targets and the yaw rate constraints on the vehicles, the problem addressed in this paper is 1) to assign each vehicle a sequence of targets to visit, and 2) to find a feasible path for each vehicle that passes through the assigned targets with a requirement that the vehicle returns to its initial position. The heading angle at each target location may not be specified. The objective function is to minimize the sum of the distances traveled by all vehicles. A constant factor approximation algorithm is presented for the above resource allocation problem for both the single and the multiple vehicle case. Note to Practitioners-The motivation for this paper stems from the need to develop resource allocation algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Small autonomous UAVs are seen as ideal platforms for many applications, such as searching for targets, mapping a given area, traffic surveillance, fire monitoring, etc. The main advantage of using these small autonomous vehicles is that they can be used in situations where a manned mission is dangerous or not possible. Resource allocation problems naturally arise in these applications where one would want to optimally assign a given set of vehicles to the tasks at hand. The feature that differentiates these resource allocation problems from similar problems previously studied in the literature is that there are constraints on the motion of the vehicle. This paper addresses the constraint that captures the inability of a fixed wing aircraft to turn at any arbitrary yaw rate. The basic problem addressed in this paper is as follows: Given n vehicles and m targets, find a path for each vehicle satisfying yaw rate contraints such that each target is visited exactly once by a vehicle and the total distance traveled by all vehicles is minimized. We assume that the targets are at least 2r apart, where r is the minimum turning radius of the vehicle. This is a reasonable assumption because the sensors on these vehicles can map or see an area whose width is at least 2r. We give an algorithm to solve this problem by combining ideas from the traveling salesman problem and the path planning literature. We also show how these algorithms perform in the worst-case scenario","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9258280","htmlLink":"/document/4049774/","displayDocTitle":"A Resource Allocation Algorithm for Multivehicle Systems With Nonholonomic Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resource Allocation Algorithm for Multivehicle Systems With Nonholonomic Constraints","sourcePdf":"04tase01-rathinam-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086545S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4049758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4049758","articleId":"4049774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4049775,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Secchi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dellIngegneria, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37300905500"},{"name":"Marcello Bonfe","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Bonfe","id":"37300903100"},{"name":"Cesare Fantuzzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi dellIngegneria, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"firstName":"Cesare","lastName":"Fantuzzi","id":"37300904700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"4049775","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"abstract":"This paper describes a modeling language that aims to provide a unified framework for representing control systems, namely, physical plants coupled with computer-based control devices. The proposed modeling methodology is based on the cardinal principle of object orientation, which allows describing both control software and physical components using the same basic concepts, particularly those of capsules, ports, and protocols. Furthermore, it is illustrated how the well-known object-oriented specification language unified modeling language can be adopted, provided an adequate formalization of its semantics, to describe structural and behavioral aspects of control systems, related to both logical and physical parts. Note to Practitioners-The development of an automated system within an industrial setting is a complex task, whose successful result depends on the joint efforts of a team of designers with different scientific backgrounds and specialized knowledge. In fact, an automated system is typically composed of a mechanical assembly, which must be precisely designed and manufactured, and a set of sensors and actuators (e.g., electrical drives, pneumatic systems, etc.), which are, on their turn, controlled most of the time by means of digital processors. Of course, both electrical parts and control algorithms (e.g., proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) regulators, logic and supervisory control, reference trajectories for mechanical motions, etc.) should be designed with the same care given to mechanical aspects. Moreover, it is undeniable that none of the various parts composing the automated system design specification can, on their own, allow engineers to understand the actual behavior of the whole system, especially without a common description language that is understandable for all of the designers. The present paper introduces a unified language which aims to support integrated design specifications of automated systems, including the dynamics of heterogeneous physical assemblies, the discrete-event behavior of distributed control software, and the specification of interface ports between the plant and the control system. With the proposed language, it is possible to obtain a complete picture of the automated system suitable for its simulation, documentation, and validation. The modeling language described in the paper supports the principles of object orientation. This choice moves in the direction of enhancing modularity and reusability properties of design specifications, which are aspects of great importance in the design practice. Moreover, the object-oriented approach to automated systems design proposed in the paper aims to introduce the concept of \"design by extension\" in the manufacturing industry. This means that the definition of specialization relationships between classes of components implies that those components should be designed in order to be substitutable with each other, especially from a dynamic point of view. This aspect will be the subject of further papers illustrating other practical insights on the use of object-oriented models for automated systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Mechatronics","Object oriented modeling","Automatic control","Control system synthesis","Assembly systems","Control systems","Physics computing","Protocols","Specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","mechatronics","object-oriented languages","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechatronic systems","modeling language","control systems","computer-based control devices","object orientation","object-oriented specification language","unified modeling language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bond graphs","object-oriented design","software engineering","system modeling","unified modeling language (UML)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASE.2006.879686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4049758/04049775.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2006.879686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of UML for Modeling Mechatronic Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of UML for Modeling Mechatronic Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049775/","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4049775/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9258281","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of UML for Modeling Mechatronic Systems","sourcePdf":"04tase01-secchi-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069839S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4049758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4049758","articleId":"4049775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4049780,"authors":[{"name":"Masaaki Sasaki","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Sendai National College of Technology, Sendai, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/4039313/4049780/4049780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masaaki Sasaki (M'98) was born in Akita, Japan, in 1973.

The dynamic range of the prototype sensor is expanded by a factor of 121.5, compared with the case of a single long exposure time. The maximum DNL of the ADC is 0.3 least significant bits (LSB) for the single-resolution mode and 0.7 LSB for the multiresolution mode","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/4039313/04049780.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2006.888058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2006.888058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor Based on Multiple Short Exposure-Time Readout With Multiple-Resolution Column-Parallel ADC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Dynamic range","Pixel","Analog-digital conversion","Signal synthesis","Prototypes","Signal resolution","Cameras","Time measurement","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS image sensors","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple short exposure-time readout","CMOS image sensor","analog-to-digital converter","exposure-time signals","least significant bits","0.25 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","multiple-exposure","multiresolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC)","wide dynamic range"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor Based on Multiple Short Exposure-Time Readout With Multiple-Resolution Column-Parallel ADC","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4049780/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9289716","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wide-Dynamic-Range CMOS Image Sensor Based on Multiple Short Exposure-Time Readout With Multiple-Resolution Column-Parallel ADC","sourcePdf":"07jsen01-sasaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073114S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"4039313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4039313","articleId":"4049780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4049781,"authors":[{"name":"Michal A.

The subtraction of distant-in-time samples frees the signal of fixed pattern noise (FPN) and of the correlated low-frequency temporal noise components, resulting in extraction of the particle footprint. The subtraction circuits are placed at each column end. A transimpedance amplifier, integrating in sequence two current samples and subtracting the results in an arithmetic operation, was adopted. The integrated version of the transimpedance amplifier, designed with a maximized conversion gain, is burdened by a risk of an early saturation, imperiling its operation, if the dispersions of the dc current component are too big. The degree of dispersions could not be estimated during the design. Some number of columns is available as a backup with the direct current readout.

The estimator has the structure of a Luenberger observer with a linear gain and a parameterized (in general, nonlinear) function, whose argument is an innovation term representing the difference between the current measurement and its prediction. The problem of the estimator design consists in finding the values of the gain and of the parameters that guarantee the asymptotic stability of the estimation error. Toward this end, if a neural network is used to take on this function, the parameters (i.e., the neural weights) are chosen, together with the gain, by constraining the derivative of a quadratic Lyapunov function for the estimation error to be negative definite on a given compact set. It is proved that it is sufficient to impose the negative definiteness of such a derivative only on a suitably dense grid of sampling points. The gain is determined by solving a Lyapunov equation. The neural weights are searched for via nonlinear programming by minimizing a cost penalizing grid-point constraints that are not satisfied. Techniques based on low-discrepancy sequences are applied to deal with a small number of sampling points, and, hence, to reduce the computational burden required to optimize the parameters.

Moreover, equal weighting is often applied to each data sample in parameter estimation. These modeling practices often become problematic if the data sets are imbalanced. We present a kernel classifier construction algorithm using orthogonal forward selection (OFS) in order to optimize the model generalization for imbalanced two-class data sets. This kernel classifier identification algorithm is based on a new regularized orthogonal weighted least squares (ROWLS) estimator and the model selection criterion of maximal leave-one-out area under curve (LOO-AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). It is shown that, owing to the orthogonalization procedure, the LOO-AUC can be calculated via an analytic formula based on the new regularized orthogonal weighted least squares parameter estimator, without actually splitting the estimation data set. The proposed algorithm can achieve minimal computational expense via a set of forward recursive updating formula in searching model terms with maximal incremental LOO-AUC value.

The proposed TAF-SVM not only solves the overfitting problem resulted from the outlier with the approach of fuzzification of the penalty, but also corrects the skew of the optimal separating hyperplane due to the very imbalanced data sets by using different cost algorithm. In addition, by introducing the total margin algorithm to replace the conventional soft margin algorithm, a lower generalization error bound can be obtained. Those three functions are embodied into the traditional SVM so that the TAF-SVM is proposed and reformulated in both linear and nonlinear cases. By using two databases, the Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) multiview and the facial recognition technology (FERET) face databases, and using the kernel Fisher's discriminant analysis (KFDA) algorithm to extract discriminating face features, experimental results show that the proposed TAF-SVM is superior to SVM in terms of the face-recognition accuracy.

The face patterns are divided into several small-scale neural networks based on fuzzy clustering and they are combined to obtain the recognition result. In particular, the proposed method achieved a 98.75% recognition accuracy for 240 patterns of 20 registrants and a 99.58% rejection rate for 240 patterns of 20 nonregistrants.

Such network architecture is important in biological neural systems. General conditions determining the existence, number, and stability of network equilibria are derived. The manner in which these features depend upon steepness of neuronal activation functions and the strength of lateral inhibition is demonstrated for a broad range of nondecreasing activation functions including the discontinuous threshold function which represents the infinite gain limit. For uniform lateral inhibitory networks, the lateral inhibition is shown to sharpen neuron output patterns by increasing separation of suprathreshold activity levels of competing neurons. This results in the tendency of one neuron's output to dominate those of the others which can afford a \"winner-take-all\" (WTA) mechanism. Importantly, multiple stable equilibria may exist and shifts in inputs levels may yield network state transitions that exhibit hysteresis. A limitation of using lateral inhibition to implement WTA is further demonstrated. The possible significance of these identified network dynamics to physiology and pathophysiology of the striatum (particularly in Parkinsonian rest tremor) is discussed","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.883724","startPage":"55","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.883724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4049808/04049830.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of Winner-Take-All Competition in Recurrent Neural Networks With Lateral Inhibition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049830/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Winner-Take-All Competition in Recurrent Neural Networks With Lateral Inhibition","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9261015","pubMedId":"17278461","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Winner-Take-All Competition in Recurrent Neural Networks With Lateral Inhibition","sourcePdf":"18tnn01-mao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057604S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"4049808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4049830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":4049835,"authors":[{"name":"Antony W.

The chip contains 2400 silicon neurons with fully programmable and reconfigurable synaptic connectivity. Each neuron implements a discrete-time model of a single-compartment cell. The model allows for analog membrane dynamics and an arbitrary number of synaptic connections, each with tunable conductance and reversal potential. The array of silicon neurons functions as an address-event (AE) transceiver, with incoming and outgoing spikes communicated over an asynchronous event-driven digital bus. Address encoding and conflict resolution of spiking events are implemented via a randomized arbitration scheme that ensures balanced servicing of event requests across the array. Routing of events is implemented externally using dynamically programmable random-access memory that stores a postsynaptic address, the conductance, and the reversal potential of each synaptic connection. Here, we describe the silicon neuron circuits, present experimental data characterizing the 3 mm times 3 mm chip fabricated in 0.5-mum complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and demonstrate its utility by configuring the hardware to emulate a model of attractor dynamics and waves of neural activity during sleep in rat hippocampus","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

dynamical systems. Wavelet network, as a kind of universal approximator, has two novel properties-orthonormality and multiresolution. The orthonormal property ensures that adding a new resolution (new wavelets) does not affect the existing wavelet network that may have been well tuned. In the sequel, the online adjustment of the structure of the nonlinear adaptive wavelet controller (AWC) can be done in a constructive manner by gradually increasing the network resolution. The multiresolution property, on the other hand, assures a guaranteed improvement of the approximation precision when a new resolution is added. In real life problems we are unable to know the adequate size of a network, either a neural network (NN) or a wavelet network, to produce the required approximation precision. By virtue of the novel wavelet network properties, a coarse or very simple structure can be selected first. If the system fails to converge after the elapse of a dwell time, a new wavelet resolution is considered to be necessary and added directly. In this manner, the AWC can be easily constructed and tuned from the coarse to finer levels until the performance requirement is satisfied. The trial and error way of selecting the network structure, which may lead to either an inadequate or a highly redundant structure, can be avoided. In this paper, the proposed adaptive wavelet network is applied first to a class of nonlinear dynamical systems with a partially known model and an affine-in-input structure. Then, the adaptive wavelet network is applied to a class of nonlinear nonaffine dynamical systems","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2006.886759","startPage":"115","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2006.886759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4049808/04049839.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Adaptive Wavelet Control Using Constructive Wavelet Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049839/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Adaptive Wavelet Control Using Constructive Wavelet Networks","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9261020","pubMedId":"17278466","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Adaptive Wavelet Control Using Constructive Wavelet Networks","sourcePdf":"18tnn01-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035717S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"4049808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4049839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4049841,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The dependence of the eye opening, overshoot and pulse amplitude fluctuation on variations in the filter center frequency and bandwidth is explored. We find that for an optimized eye opening in the noninverted signal the filter should be detuned towards lower frequency with respect to the probe frequency.

Monitoring and troubleshooting can also be handled remotely, and upgrades involve simple software uploads, rather than expensive hardware overhauls","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2007.273037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/4049942/04049956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2007.273037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049942","startPage":"28","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Revolutionaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4049956","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio Revolutionaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257889","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4049956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Revolutionaries","sourcePdf":"442007-Jean-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036541S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6","isNumber":"4049942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4049942","articleId":"4049956","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4049962,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel K.

If Z-RAM grabs even a little piece of the on-chip memory market, it will change the ground rules for microprocessor design and quickly make Innovative Silicon a company to be reckoned with. This development is considered to be a success, because its technology could quintuple the amount of memory incorporated into microprocessor chips and make them both cheaper and faster","doi":"10.1109/MSPEC.2007.273045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/4049942/04049962.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSPEC.2007.273045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4049942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Masters of Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4049962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Masters of Memory","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257895","htmlLink":"/document/4049962/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Masters of Memory","sourcePdf":"442007-Samuel-20.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026612S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6","isNumber":"4049942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4049942","articleId":"4049962","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"}]
