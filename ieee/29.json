It is based on the stochastic evolution heuristic, which is an effective heuristic for solving several combinatorial optimization problems. We perform the partitioning at the behavioral level. The advantage of partitioning at the behavioral level is that both area and time constraints can be taken care of at the system level and also that scheduling/allocation can be applied concurrently to system-level partitioning. We formulate the partitioning problem as an extension to the network-bisectioning problem for which the stochastic evolution heuristic has been shown to provide better results than the simulated annealing technique. Preliminary scheduling/allocation and pin sharing are also performed simultaneously to estimate the area and pincount of each of the partitions. Efficient partitions are obtained for some of the digital signal processing applications in reasonable CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290003/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4677637","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"4-5 March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automated system partitioning for synthesis of multi-chip modules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated system partitioning for synthesis of multi-chip modules","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"00290003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028806S","chronDate":"4-5 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"959","citationCount":"8","articleId":"290003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":290005,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Fang Chao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eiiginecring, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Liang-Fang Chao","id":"37087158700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-8186-5610-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"290005","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=290005","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing cyclic data-flow graphs via associativity","abstract":"An iterative or recursive algorithm, with interiteration precedence relations is represented by a cyclic data-flow graph (DFG), where nodes represented operations.

Instead of using a conventional two stage scheme which has a boost front end followed by a DC-DC converter, a boost derived topology is chosen to achieve high power factor, isolation, and voltage step down. A newly proposed technology of soft switched insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) is used for this application to reduce the IGBT switching loss and achieve low conduction loss. The design considerations of the power stage and the control circuit are provided. A prototype converter is built to show the feasibility of the single stage scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1993.290630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1993.290630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206","startPage":"196","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition,","pdfPath":"/iel2/1056/7206/00290630.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition,","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=290630","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power factor correction","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Reactive power","Power systems","AC-DC power converters","DC-DC power converters","Circuit topology","Voltage","Isolation technology","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate bipolar transistors","losses","power convertors","power systems","power transistors","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transistors","soft switching","power factor correction","distributed power systems","AC-DC power converters","isolation","boost","voltage step down","insulated gate bipolar transistors","IGBT","switching loss","conduction loss","design","48 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Isolated boost circuit for power factor correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Mar 1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4681554","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290630/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated boost circuit for power factor correction","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00290630.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025368S","chronDate":"7-11 Mar 1993","isNumber":"7206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1056","citationCount":"77","articleId":"290630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":290634,"authors":[{"name":"L.

By using the new models, the simulated performances of electronic lamp ballast circuits realized with DMOS transistors and IGBTs are compared to the measured and simulated performance of the conventional bipolar version.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APEC.1993.290708","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition,","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition,","pdfPath":"/iel2/1056/7206/00290708.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","doi":"10.1109/APEC.1993.290708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit simulation models for MOS-gated power devices: application to the simulation of an electronic lamp ballast circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"Circuit simulation models for MOS-gated power devices: application to the simulation of an electronic lamp ballast circuit","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 March 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4686950","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290708/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit simulation models for MOS-gated power devices: application to the simulation of an electronic lamp ballast circuit","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00290708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055041S","chronDate":"7-11 Mar 1993","isNumber":"7206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1056","citationCount":"4","articleId":"290708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":290722,"authors":[{"name":"F.D.

In future electronic warfare environments, pulse densities on the order of hundreds of thousands of pulses per second can be expected in any given mission. To identify hostile radar systems, a processor must be able to store enough signatures for emitters of interest that proper identifications of unknown emitters can be made. Furthermore, the processor must make this identification in \"real-time\". This paper presents the results obtained when the Electronically Trainable Neural Network (ETANN) hardware is used to perform emitter identification from time-sampled emitter waveforms. The ETANN is a low (4-6 bit) resolution, high speed (2 billion operations/sec) parallel processor implementing sigmoidal-based backpropagation networks. This hardware was chosen due to minimal interlayer processing times, 3 us per layer, which can allow threat identifications to be made in a matter of microseconds. For this paper, a sigmoidal-based neural network was developed, via simulation on a DEC VAX station, to discriminate between 30 emitters. The network weights were loaded on the ETANN for performance comparisons. Due to resolution constraints, the accuracy of the ETANN was typically 10%-12% lower. However, the ETANN was able to make classifications in less than 6 us. This significant processing speed, with only slight degradations in performance, makes neural network architectures viable alternatives for emitter identification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290823/","accessionNumber":"4701132","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network hardware implementation for emitter identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network hardware implementation for emitter identification","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00290823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034032S","chronDate":"24-28 May 1993","isNumber":"7207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1069","citationCount":"1","articleId":"290823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":290825,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

An efficient associative retrieval technique is then applied to make the robot follow a minimal cost polynomial path. In the movement, when it faces an obstacle, the robot uses a contour finding algorithm to get away from the obstacle.

A steady state heat transfer analysis was performed using calculated heat dissipations and boundary temperatures that were obtained through data supplied by the TWT's manufacturer. The resulting temperatures from this analysis were used as loading conditions in a linear static analysis of a smaller model which represents a 12 turn section of the circuit. The failure modes investigated were cracking of the helix tape and fracture of the support rods due to excessive thermal stresses. Cracking of the helix tape would cause an open-circuit to occur while fracture of the support rods could cause small mechanical perturbations in the slow wave structure which may reflect the RF signal. Both cases could possibly lead to electrical failure of the TWT. Static stress analysis of the attenuation section indicated that the stress levels in the helix and support rods due to this particular temperature gradient were within acceptable limits and would not fracture if these components were free of initial cracks or flaws. Stresses through the helix were sufficient to nucleate cracks, however the length of these cracks would be minute and would not affect the useful life of the helix.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4701106","conferenceDate":"24-28 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-structural reliability assessment of helix TWT interaction circuit using finite element analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-structural reliability assessment of helix TWT interaction circuit using finite element analysis","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00290849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038511S","chronDate":"24-28 May 1993","isNumber":"7207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1069","citationCount":"11","articleId":"290849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":290898,"authors":[{"name":"Yiquan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yiquan Wu","id":"37351571600"},{"name":"Zhaoda Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoda Zhu","id":"37281370300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1295-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"290898","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Arithmetic","Speech coding","Image coding","Filtering","Pattern recognition","Costs","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete cosine transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radix-3 fast algorithm","discrete cosine transform","fast cosine transform","radix-3 FCT algorithm","signal flowgraph","length-3/sup 2/ FCT","computational complexity","length-2/sup 1/.3/sup m/ DCT","prime factor decomposition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a new radix-3 fast algorithm for the length -3/sup m/ discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed, to further extend the applicability of the fast cosine transform (FCT) algorithm.

Next, a block diagram of the radix-3 FCT algorithm is shown and the signal flowgraph for length-3/sup 2/ FCT is given to illustrate the proposed algorithm. Finally, the computational complexity is analysed. The proposed algorithm requires less number of arithmetic operations and allows in-place computation. The simple and regular structure makes it easy to be implemented. One can compute effectively the length-2/sup 1/.3/sup m/ DCT using this length-3/sup m/ algorithm together with the existing length-2/sup 1/ algorithm by prime factor decomposition.

Although these techniques are considered efficient for most applications, in cases involving repeated solutions such as security analysis or real time control, direct solvers may still not be sufficiently fast. The incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is a very powerful semi-iterative solver which has been proven to have significant speed advantages over direct methods in the area of finite element electromagnetic analysis (ratios of 100 to 1 are not uncommon). In this paper, the PCG algorithm is applied to the fast decoupled load flow and to the DC load flow. The computation time of the new PCG algorithm is compared with that of a standard direct solver for a wide spectrum of power networks up to 5000 buses and 10000 lines. The results of numerical experiments indicate that for certain classes of large sparse systems or for repeated solutions with matrix modifications, the PCG method is significantly more efficient than direct techniques and offers important savings in CPU time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1993.290989","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","startPage":"404","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1993.290989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208","pdfPath":"/iel2/1071/7208/00290989.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Power system analysis computing","Power system security","Equations","Finite element methods","Electromagnetic analysis","Character generation","Load flow","Clustering algorithms","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","load flow","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm","power network analysis","sparse systems","linear equations","power system","security analysis","real time control","incomplete Cholesky pre-conditioned conjugate gradient","semi-iterative solver","finite element electromagnetic analysis","fast decoupled load flow","DC load flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the application of a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to power network analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/290989/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4677134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to power network analysis","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00290989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043762S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1993","isNumber":"7208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1071","citationCount":"10","articleId":"290989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":290995,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The optimal hydro scheduling problem is formulated as a large scale linear programming algorithm and is solved using a commercially-available linear programming package. The selected objective function requires minimization of the value of energy used by turbines and spilled during the study period. Alternative formulations of the objective function are also discussed. The system model incorporates the following elements: hydro station (turbine efficiency, turbine flow limits, penstock head losses, tailrace elevation and generator losses), hydro system (reservoirs and hydro network: active volume, spillway flow, flow between reservoirs and travel time), and other models including thermal plant and DC link. A valuable by-product of the linear programming solution is system and unit incremental costs which may be used for interchange scheduling and short-term generation dispatch.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1993.291004","startPage":"292","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1993.291004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1071/7208/00291004.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal short-term scheduling for a large-scale cascaded hydro system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291004/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal short-term scheduling for a large-scale cascaded hydro system","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4677119","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal short-term scheduling for a large-scale cascaded hydro system","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00291004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030408S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1993","isNumber":"7208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1071","citationCount":"16","articleId":"291004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":291024,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chi Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Chi Wu","id":"37281224200"},{"name":"A.S.

The formulation and the solution technique are new. Both equalities and inequalities in the OPF are considered and simultaneously solved in a nonlinear manner based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The major computational effort of the algorithm is solving a symmetrical system of equations, whose sparsity structure is fixed. Therefore only one optimal ordering and one symbolic factorization are involved. Numerical results of several test systems ranging in size from 9 to 2423 buses are presented and comparisons are made with the pure primal-dual interior point algorithm. The results show that the predictor-corrector primal-dual interior point algorithm for OPF is computationally more attractive than the pure primal-dual interior point algorithm in terms of speed and iteration count.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/1071/7208/00291024.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Application Conference","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1993.291024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1993.291024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct nonlinear predictor-corrector primal-dual interior point algorithm for optimal power flows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Quadratic programming","Equations","Functional programming","Power generation","Mathematical programming","Power systems","Linear programming","Convergence","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear predictor-corrector","primal-dual interior point algorithm","nonlinear optimal power flows","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions","symmetrical equations system","sparsity structure","symbolic factorization","optimal ordering","iteration count"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"A direct nonlinear predictor-corrector primal-dual interior point algorithm for optimal power flows","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4677099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct nonlinear predictor-corrector primal-dual interior point algorithm for optimal power flows","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00291024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03839S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1993","isNumber":"7208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1071","citationCount":"4","articleId":"291024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":291033,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, the authors generalize the idea to more general computer architectures and demonstrate how to effectively increase the speedup upper bounds of G-S algorithms by properly managing the bottlenecks on both Sequent Balance SRM and nCUBE2 distributed memory (DM) machines. For G-S algorithms, when the coloring process is used to schedule the processors, there is almost no sequential portion. Thus, the only decisive factor left, which has a direct impact on the speedup upper bound, is the synchronization overhead. Accordingly, the authors propose a new synchronization scheme which can reduce the synchronization overhead on the Sequent Balance machine, Also, on the nCUBE2 machine, a new clustered G-S algorithm is proposed and implemented. The algorithm carefully schedules their processors, computational loads and communication overheads for the best performance. In addition, the synchronization overheads and speedup upper bounds on both machines are analyzed in terms of power system size and number of processors. The competitiveness of G-S type algorithms is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291033/","accessionNumber":"4677090","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Managing the bottlenecks in parallel Gauss-Seidel type algorithms for power flow analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing the bottlenecks in parallel Gauss-Seidel type algorithms for power flow analysis","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00291033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02806S","chronDate":"4-7 May 1993","isNumber":"7208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1071","citationCount":"7","articleId":"291033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":291118,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Two criteria for modules integration not previously investigated are the reliability and accuracy of the system. This paper presents the results of the development of a framework for a \"criterion\" embodying these two modular robot characteristics. Using a probabilistic representation of manipulator kinematics and a reliability block diagram model of the manipulator system, a reliability performance index (RPI) representing the probability of no hardware or software failure and the manipulator achieving a specified position and orientation is developed. The RPI is tested with a case study consisting of a three degree-of-freedom planar manipulator assembled from a choice of six joint modules of varying reliability and precision and a choice of six link module combinations of varying lengths and machining tolerances. A straight-line, square trajectory is specified and the RPI is calculated for each combination of joint modules and links, a total of 1296 different combinations. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on the results using the different joint locations and link options as factors and the different joint modules and link options as factor levels. The different factors are tested for significance and the Tukey Studentized Range Test is performed to determine significance of the different joint modules and link options. Using this statistical testing, a 70% reduction in the module design space is achieved using the RPI. Optimization using other appropriate manipulator criteria can then be performed to generate the final configuration. Additional extensive case studies are needed to fully develop the RPI to a stage necessary for implementation into a computer-aided design system for modular robot configuration design. The RPI may also be useful in the quantification of the overall system reliability and performance of any system based upon measured error, such as control systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1101/7209/00291118.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","doi":"10.1109/RAMS.1994.291118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1994.291118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and testing of a reliability performance index for modular robotic systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Performance analysis","Economic indicators","Manipulators","Robots","Analysis of variance","Kinematics","Hardware","Software performance","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","statistical analysis","kinematics","performance index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability performance index","modular robotic systems","fully functional robot system","accuracy","probabilistic representation","manipulator kinematics","reliability block diagram model","three degree-of-freedom planar manipulator","straight-line square trajectory","analysis of variance","ANOVA","Tukey Studentized Range Test","joint modules","link options","statistical testing","configuration design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Development and testing of a reliability performance index for modular robotic systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4710966","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and testing of a reliability performance index for modular robotic systems","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035774S","chronDate":"24-27Jan 1994","isNumber":"7209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1101","citationCount":"11","articleId":"291118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":291149,"authors":[{"name":"F.B.

Instead of an ad hoc binary classification of the correctness of the output, it is more intuitive to use a fuzzy set based classification scheme. One approach is to let the value of the fuzzy set membership function denote the degree of acceptability (i.e., correctness) of the output. In this paper, we investigate several such fuzzy-failure criteria and their effects on system reliability in embedded computer systems. We first model the fuzzy output level of a response to a sensor event as a random variable in the range of [0,1] with 0 indicating that the output is completely acceptable and 1 indicating that the output is completely unacceptable. Then we derive analytical expressions for the reliability of systems for various fuzzy-failure criteria and compare their numerical solutions. We conclude that the reliability of such systems depends significantly on the fuzzy-failure criterion defined by the system designer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1101/7209/00291149.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","doi":"10.1109/RAMS.1994.291149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.1994.291149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of systems with fuzzy-failure criterion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded computing","Failure analysis","Fuzzy sets","Random variables","Sensor systems","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy logic","Robotics and automation","Path planning","Manufacturing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process control","fuzzy set theory","fault tolerant computing","failure analysis","real-time systems","reliability theory","process computer control","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability modelling","fuzzy-failure criterion","fuzzy set theory","classification scheme","membership function","correctness","system reliability","continuous process control","sensor event","random variable"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of systems with fuzzy-failure criterion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4706037","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of systems with fuzzy-failure criterion","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045141S","chronDate":"24-27Jan 1994","isNumber":"7209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1101","citationCount":"26","articleId":"291149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":291153,"authors":[{"name":"A.H.

Two sources of input information were utilized in this system: a multiprobe vibration analysis system (MVAS) and a driver and/or technician from truck services. It was soon apparent a classic expert system approach was impractical due to the enormous number of inference rules necessary to draw diagnostic conclusions. To reduce this requirement we added a neural network trained to analyze data acquired from MVAS. It greatly improved Ride Expert's robustness and reduced the number of necessary rules to about 1/3. This paper presents the Ride Expert development stages and what we have learned from this process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291153/","accessionNumber":"4705994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network enhancement for a reliability expert-system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network enhancement for a reliability expert-system","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043671S","chronDate":"24-27Jan 1994","isNumber":"7209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1101","articleId":"291153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":291234,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

This paper discusses two such algorithms, namely the 'Detection of line segments via Hough transform' and 'Backprojection in CT image reconstruction'. To gain a significant speed advantage, we present a multi-function cell for performing one of four nonlinear operations: (1) square-root, (2) reciprocal, (3) sine/cosine, and (4) arctangent/spl minus/all realized in a single chip, available on a selectable basis, and outputting a new result every two clock cycles. The design and test results of a 24 bit and a 16 bit four-function \"two cycle\" VLSI chip, both fabricated in 2.0 micron CMOS technology, are described. Also discussed is a new \"one-cycle\" architecture, which can potentially double the throughput of the chip. Using this nonlinear cell an application level Hough transform module is developed. The Hough module can deliver parameters of the line in the image plane every clock cycle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICWSI.1994.291234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 International Conference on Wafer Scale Integration (ICWSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 International Conference on Wafer Scale Integration (ICWSI)","pdfPath":"/iel2/1112/7211/00291234.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWSI.1994.291234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image processing using a universal nonlinear cell","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291234/","displayDocTitle":"Image processing using a universal nonlinear cell","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4677371","conferenceDate":"19-21 Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image processing using a universal nonlinear cell","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049487S","chronDate":"19-21 Jan 1994","isNumber":"7211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1112","citationCount":"10","articleId":"291234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":291255,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

This is used to develop a simple and accurate technique using a single experimental setup for the parasitic-free characterization of the intrinsic laser parameters, including the relaxation resonance frequency, the total relaxation rate, the nonlinear relaxation rate, and the linewidth enhancement factor. Other parameters, such as the spontaneous carrier lifetime, the photon lifetime, the differential and nonlinear gain parameters, and the K factor, are determined from the power dependencies of these parameters.

The results obtained from this model are applied to and found to agree very well with experimental measurements of spectral distortions and time-resolved gain on a semiconductor laser amplifier with 460-fs and 2-ps input pulses. The device parameters that are used to match the experimental results are within a reasonable range, either suggested by previous experiments or by published calculations, The results show that the evolution of the pulses and their spectra is sensitively dependent on the input pulse shape and on a variety of time domain and frequency domain amplitude and phase shaping effects. Matching the theory to the experimental data suggests that among the possible causes of the carrier heating two-photon absorption (TPA) is the most important. This effect of TPA needs to be included to properly account for the observed dependence of the carrier heating gain reduction on the pulse length. By examining separately the contribution of the corresponding terms, we also prove the importance of SPM due to the carrier heating and to the instantaneous nonlinear index in shaping the output spectrum. We compare our model with Agrawal's theory, which is valid for pulses of tens of picosecond duration, and find large differences for subpicosecond pulses. For 2-ps pulses, on the other hand, the differences are fewer and less dramatic. The good agreement of the new model with experiments will now allow diagnostics and predictions of pulse evolution in semiconductor optical amplifiers from the picosecond to the subpicosecond range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.291381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7213/00291381.pdf","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1131","doi":"10.1109/3.291381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subpicosecond pulse amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers: theory and experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Subpicosecond pulse amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers: theory and experiment","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4727854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subpicosecond pulse amplification in semiconductor laser amplifiers: theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00291381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055846S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"58","articleId":"291381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":291440,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Commonly used Markov random fields are not in fact capable of representing the moderate-to-large scale clustering present in naturally occurring images and can also be time consuming to simulate, requiring iterative algorithms which can take hundreds of thousands of sweeps of the image to converge. Markov mesh models, a causal subclass of Markov random fields, are, however, readily simulated. We describe an empirical study of simulated realizations from various models used in the literature, and we introduce some new mesh-type models. We conclude, however, that while large-scale clustering may be represented by such models, strong directional effects are also present for all but very limited parameterizations. It is emphasized that the results do not detract from the use of Markov random fields as representers of local spatial properties, which is their main purpose in the implementation of Bayesian statistical approaches to image analysis. Brief allusion is made to the issue of parameter estimation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4713247","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An empirical study of the simulation of various models used for images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical study of the simulation of various models used for images","sourcePdf":"00291447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049295S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"34","articleId":"291447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":291449,"authors":[{"name":"Mou-Yen Chen","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition (CEDAR), State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Mou-Yen Chen","id":"37367629900"},{"name":"Amlan Kundu","affiliation":["Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Amlan Kundu","id":"37342479600"},{"name":"Jian Zhou","affiliation":["State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Zhou","id":"37383615600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"291449","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":146,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":642},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Hidden Markov models","Stochastic processes","Character recognition","Writing","Morphology","Viterbi algorithm","Text analysis","Speech processing","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","hidden Markov models","mathematical morphology","heuristic programming","image segmentation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-line handwritten word recognition","hidden Markov model type stochastic network","totally unconstrained handwritten word recognition","morphology","heuristics based segmentation algorithm","training algorithm","Viterbi algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Because of large variations involved in handwritten words, the recognition problem is very difficult.

Implicit calibration can be used for both three-dimensional (3-D) measurement and generation of image coordinates. In this paper, we present a new implicit model based on the generalized projective mappings between the image plane and two calibration planes. The back-projection and projection processes are modelled separately to ease the computation of distorted image coordinates from known world points. A set of constraints of perspectivity is derived to relate the transformation parameters of the two calibration planes. Under the assumption of the radial distortion model, we present a computationally efficient method for explicitly correcting the distortion of image coordinates in frame buffer without involving the computation of camera position and orientation. By combining with any linear calibration techniques, this method makes explicit the camera physical parameters. Extensive experimental comparison of our methods with the classic photogrammetric method and Tsai's (1986) method in the aspects of 3-D measurement (both absolute and relative errors), the prediction of image coordinates, and the effect of the number of calibration points, is made using real images from 15 different depth values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implicit and explicit camera calibration: theory and experiments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.291450","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7215/00291450.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.291450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Implicit and explicit camera calibration: theory and experiments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4713244","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit and explicit camera calibration: theory and experiments","sourcePdf":"00291450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044384S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"191","articleId":"291450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":291459,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A neural network-type controller is developed in this article for its function-approximation abilities and its learning and adaptive capabilities. A cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network is implemented in a research automobile to demonstrate the feasibility of this control architecture.

We begin by reviewing the standard feed-forward rendering pipeline, showing how different ways of parallelizing it lead to three classes of rendering algorithms. Next, we consider each of these classes in detail, analyzing their aggregate processing and communication costs, possible variations, and constraints they may impose on rendering applications.

A parallel algorithm designed for polygon scan conversion and rendering is presented which supports fast rendering of highly complex data sets using advanced lighting models. Dedicated graphics rendering engines do not necessarily suit such data sets, although they can support real-time update of moderately complex scenes using simple lighting. Advantages to using a software-based approach include the feasibility of adding special rendering features to the program and the capability of integrating a parallel scientific application with a parallel graphics renderer. A new work decomposition strategy presented, called task adaptive, is based on dynamically partitioning the amount of computational work left at a given time. The algorithm uses a heuristic for dynamic task decomposition in which image space tasks are partitioned without requiring interruption of the partitioned processor. A sophisticated memory referencing strategy lets local memory access graphics data during rendering. This permits implementation of the algorithm on a distributed memory multiprocessor. An in-depth analysis of the overhead costs accompanying parallel processing shows where performance is adequate or could be improved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/38.291530","startPage":"41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/38/7217/00291530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.291530","endPage":"48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic load balancing for parallel polygon rendering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic load balancing for parallel polygon rendering","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4736306","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic load balancing for parallel polygon rendering","sourcePdf":"00291530.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053091S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"24","articleId":"291530","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":291533,"authors":[{"name":"D.

While the drain current at a fixed gate bias and the pinchoff voltage of the GaAs PHEMT consistently decreased under the influence of the hydrogen gas, they were found to either increase or decrease with the InP HEMT. The change of device characteristics resulting from exposure to the hydrogen environment is not permanent; partial recovery of device characteristics was observed under either nitrogen or hydrogen at both elevated and room temperatures. The change in HEMT DC characteristics seems to be primarily resulted from the change in the gate built-in potential.

Results are obtained comparing task achievement in the absence of inter-agent communication relative to performance given the minimal knowledge of the behavorial state of fellow agents. Simple communication can result in significant performance enhancement. More robots generally mean more efficient use of time, and an overall speedup of goal recovery. Upon inspection of the larger body of results, which give the percentage of timeouts per number of shots, it is apparent that there is greater tendency for timing out with fewer robots. The distance graphs indicate that by adding robots, independent of communication, the task can be accomplished faster.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291841","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00291841.pdf","startPage":"588","endPage":"594 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication of behavorial state in multi-agent retrieval tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Communication of behavorial state in multi-agent retrieval tasks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4690879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291841/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication of behavorial state in multi-agent retrieval tasks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052054S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"54","articleId":"291841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":291842,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

A key difficulty in this development is determining the appropriate balance between the use of global information and the use of local information to achieve coherent cooperation without excessive communication requirements. This issue is addressed by presenting some general guidelines and principles for determining the appropriate level of global versus local control. These principles are illustrated and implemented in a 'keep formation' cooperative task case study, which presents several alternative control strategies along the local versus global spectrum. Experimental data that demonstrate that local control alone is not sufficient to meet the goals of certain tasks, and that an increasing use of global knowledge can result in a steadily improving group cooperation, are presented. It is concluded that the use of local control information to ground global knowledge in the current situation is perhaps the best way to achieve the proper balance between local and global control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00291842.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"587 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing control laws for cooperative agent teams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Cooperative systems","Artificial intelligence","Laboratories","Guidelines","Centralized control","Global communication","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","decentralised control","large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control law design","local knowledge","formation-keeping","cooperative agent teams","global knowledge","group behavior","coherent cooperation","communication requirements","local control","global control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Designing control laws for cooperative agent teams","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4690878","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing control laws for cooperative agent teams","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030024S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"96","articleId":"291842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":291846,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The algorithm maintains stable and accurate force control even if large positional disturbances occur in force-controlled directions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Robot control","Damping","Force control","Force sensors","Manipulator dynamics","Sampling methods","Robot sensing systems","Robust stability","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","damping","force control","manipulators","position control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acceleration control","robot manipulators","nonlinear active damping","hybrid position/force control algorithm","stable response","contact stiffness","end-effector","force overshoot","positional disturbances"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291911","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00291911.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"486 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized acceleration control of robot manipulators with nonlinear active damping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized acceleration control of robot manipulators with nonlinear active damping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291911/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4690809","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized acceleration control of robot manipulators with nonlinear active damping","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046625S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","articleId":"291911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":291936,"authors":[{"name":"S.

An elastic band is a deformable collision-free path. The initial shape of the elastic is the free path generated by a planner. Subjected to artificial forces, the elastic band deforms in real time to a short and smooth path that maintains clearance from the obstacles. The elastic continues to deform as changes in the environment are detected by sensors, enabling the robot to accommodate uncertainties and react to unexpected and moving obstacles. While providing a tight connection between the robot and its environment, the elastic band preserves the global nature of the planned path. The framework is outlined, and an efficient implementation based on bubbles is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291936","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00291936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","startPage":"802","endPage":"807 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic bands: connecting path planning and control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=291936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Elastic bands: connecting path planning and control","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291936/","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4700693","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic bands: connecting path planning and control","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032995S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"342","articleId":"291936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":291944,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is sufficient if the environment is modeled by the order of appearance of various landmarks and by adjacency relationships. Also, the robot can response to human-supplied commands. This capability is achieved by an ensemble of neural networks whose activation and deactivation are controlled by a supervisory controller that is rule-based. The individual neural networks in the ensemble are trained to interpret visual information and perform primitive navigational tasks such as hallway following and landmark detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291944","startPage":"750","endPage":"757 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00291944.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NEURO-NAV: a neural network based architecture for vision-guided mobile robot navigation using non-metrical models of the environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Mobile robots","Navigation","Humans","Robot sensing systems","Solid modeling","Humanoid robots","Robot vision systems","Roads","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","computerised navigation","mobile robots","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonmetrical models","NEURO-NAV","neural network based architecture","vision-guided mobile robot navigation","human-supplied commands","activation","deactivation","supervisory controller","visual information","hallway following","landmark detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"NEURO-NAV: a neural network based architecture for vision-guided mobile robot navigation using non-metrical models of the environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","accessionNumber":"4700685","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NEURO-NAV: a neural network based architecture for vision-guided mobile robot navigation using non-metrical models of the environment","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043474S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"15","articleId":"291944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":291945,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Two different feedforward (multilayer) neural networks are used to generate the inverse dynamics and to estimate the payload mass of a two-link planar manipulator. The inverse dynamics ANN receives the same input signals as a conventional computed torque controller as well as the payload mass estimate. By using a separate ANN to generate the payload mass estimate, both ANNs can be trained off-line. The proposed neural network architecture is implemented on actual hardware using a neurocomputer. Experimental results indicate that the ANN-based controller is able to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the actual manipulator.

The robot performs docking and target reaching without prior geometric calibration of its components. All effects of control signals on the robot are learned by the controller through visual observation during a training period and refined during actual operation. This method avoids computation of the inverse perspective projection and robot arm inverse kinematic transformations. This approach features small, efficiently trainable neural networks which exhibit sufficiently accurate performance for the authors' reaching tasks. Their design confirms that successful arm control can be achieved without calculating the camera baseline parameters explicitly. Rather than recalibrating the system off-line following a minor change to its configuration, it is possible for the robot to adapt to the new mappings on-line.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/291946/","accessionNumber":"4700683","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficiently trainable neural network based vision-guided robot arm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficiently trainable neural network based vision-guided robot arm","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00291946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032285S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"3","articleId":"291946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":291973,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

A radial-distance transducer, called the telescopic ball-bar system, is used to measure simply the distance of the robot endpoint from a fixed point in the workspace. Special fixtures are mounted on the robot endpoint and on the robot table in order to indirectly access the complete pose information of the robot. All the independent parameters of a six-degree-of-freedom robot have been identified.

Five low-cost inertial sensors are used: two accelerometers and three gyros. The robot's attitude, represented by its roll and pitch angles, can be obtained using two different methods.

The second one proceeds by integration of the differential equation relating the robot's attitude and its instantaneous angular velocity which is measured by the gyrometers. The results of these two methods are fused, using an extended Kalman filter.

All the robots cannot communicate globally, but some robots can communicate locally and coordinate to avoid competition for public resources. In such systems, it is difficult for each robot to plan its motion effectively, while considering other robots. Therefore, each robot determines its motion selfishly, planning its motion while considering the known environment and using empirical knowledge. The robot also considers its unknown environment, which includes the other robots, in the empirical knowledge. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the motion of the planning. Each robot iteratively acquires knowledge of its unknown environment, expressed by fuzzy logic, and the system behaves efficiently as an evolutionary process. As an illustration, path planning by multiple mobile robots is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.292069","startPage":"760","endPage":"765 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00292069.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.292069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinative behavior by genetic algorithm and fuzzy in evolutionary multi-agent system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy systems","Multiagent systems","Robot kinematics","Motion planning","Orbital robotics","Mobile robots","Strategic planning","Path planning","Intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","intelligent control","knowledge representation","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinative behavior","selfish planning","environment representation","genetic algorithm","evolutionary multi-agent system","motion planning","multiple robots","unknown environment","empirical knowledge","fuzzy logic","evolutionary process","path planning","mobile robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Coordinative behavior by genetic algorithm and fuzzy in evolutionary multi-agent system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","accessionNumber":"4687210","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinative behavior by genetic algorithm and fuzzy in evolutionary multi-agent system","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00292069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059552S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"23","articleId":"292069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":292086,"authors":[{"name":"I.D.

By doing the core calculations in hardware, full use can be made of the redundancy by implementing more complex self-motion algorithms. A key component of the architecture is the calculation in VLSI hardware of the singular value decomposition of the manipulator Jacobian. CORDIC arithmetic is used in the design of the special-purpose VLSI array, which is used in computation of the direct kinematics solution (DKS), the manipulator Jacobian, and the Jacobian pseudoinverse. Application-specific (subtask-dependent) portions of the inverse kinematics are handled in parallel by a DSP processor that interfaces with the custom hardware and the host machine. The architecture and algorithm development are valid for general redundant manipulators and a wide range of processors currently available and under development commercially.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Parallel robots","Robot kinematics","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture","Jacobian matrices","Manipulators","Hardware","Concurrent computing","Robot control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised control","digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","kinematics","parallel architectures","real-time systems","robots","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel VLSI architecture","kinematics","redundant robots","redundancy","self-motion algorithms","singular value decomposition","manipulator Jacobian","CORDIC arithmetic","VLSI array","DSP processor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292086","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1993.292086","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel2/904/7227/00292086.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.292086","startPage":"870","endPage":"877 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7227","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel VLSI architectures for real-time kinematics of redundant robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel VLSI architectures for real-time kinematics of redundant robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 May 1993","conferenceDate":"2-6 May 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4687227","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel VLSI architectures for real-time kinematics of redundant robots","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00292086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047186S","chronDate":"2-6 May 1993","isNumber":"7227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"904","citationCount":"9","articleId":"292086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":292089,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

We report how the majority of the problems attributed to poor requirements traceability are due to inadequate pre-RS traceability and show the fundamental need for improvements.

A novel technique for modeling Delta-I noise associated with power and ground planes is presented in this paper. This new approach considers not only the wave propagation and resonance in power and ground planes, also the geometry of the interconnections such as the via radius, which results in accurate prediction of the Delta-I noise waveforms. An electromagnetic field solver is employed to model the power/ground planes connected with vias, and is linked to SPICE type circuit solvers to analyze the components off the planes. This simulation technique is found to be very fast in computation speed and also highly accurate. Simulation results are provided together with a comparison of Delta-I analysis performed by the method of this paper and IBM's ASTAP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Delta-I noise in digital electronics packaging","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Multi-Chip Module Conference (MCMC-94)","doi":"10.1109/MCMC.1994.292515","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Multi-Chip Module Conference (MCMC-94)","pdfPath":"/iel3/954/7231/00292515.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"131","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00292515.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCMC.1994.292515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Delta-I noise in digital electronics packaging","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4677707","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Delta-I noise in digital electronics packaging","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00292515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034908S","chronDate":"15-17 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"954","citationCount":"26","articleId":"292515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":292517,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For a large class of soft and hard real-time applications, the degree of consistency among servers can be exploited to design replication protocols with predictable timing behavior. This is particularly useful in applications such as automated process control, in which one can trade off the quality or precision for timely availability of data. This paper presents the architecture and prototype implementation of a primary-backup replication service that employs window consistency semantics between the primary data repository and the backups. A client registers a data object with the service by declaring the consistency requirements for the data, in terms of a time window. The primary ensures that each backup site maintains a version of the object that was valid on the primary within the preceding time window by scheduling update messages to the backups. Decoupling the transmission of updates to the backups from the processing of client requests permits the primary to handle a higher rate of operations and provide more timely service to clients. The non-blocking semantics free the client from waiting for updates to the backups to complete. Furthermore, real-time scheduling of update messages can guarantee controlled inconsistency between the primary and backup repositories.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RTOSS.1994.292551","startPage":"107","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 11th IEEE Workshop on Real-Time Operating Systems and Software","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTOSS.1994.292551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 11th IEEE Workshop on Real-Time Operating Systems and Software","pdfPath":"/iel3/971/7232/00292551.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Window-consistent replication for real-time applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292551/","displayDocTitle":"Window-consistent replication for real-time applications","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4700878","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-consistent replication for real-time applications","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00292551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037535S","chronDate":"18-19 May 1994","isNumber":"7232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"971","citationCount":"2","articleId":"292551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":292622,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

Initially tailored to the conventional transient stability problem, this method has gradually evolved to handle many other power system security concerns: voltage security both preventive-wise and curative- (or emergency-) wise, transient stability power flow limits in large corridors, and steady-state security. All these applications have shown the suitability of the decision tree method for assessing power system security. At the same time, and despite some remaining limitations, they suggested that: (i) proper strategies have to be designed to solve existing, old problems in the conventional fields of planning, operation planning and real time operation; and (ii) proper strategies also have to be developed to tackle emergency problems which so far were considered to be beyond reach. This paper addresses the following two issues: appraise the present status of the decision tree security assessment (DTSA) method, i.e. what has been achieved so far and what still remains to be done; and suggest appropriate DTSA uses, i.e. (re)formulate old problems, identify new ones, and suggest appropriate strategies able to match them with the DTSA possibilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in decision trees applied to power system security assessment","publicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1183/7233/00292688.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"53 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Advances in decision trees applied to power system security assessment","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4695676","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in decision trees applied to power system security assessment","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"00292688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034573S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7233","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1183","citationCount":"5","articleId":"292688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":292717,"authors":[{"name":"L.L.

Fault diagnosis is carried out by mapping input data patterns, which represent the behaviour of the system, to one or more fault conditions. The behaviour of the converters is described in terms of the time varying patterns of conducting thyristors and AC and DC fault characteristics. A three-layer neural network consisting of 20 input nodes, 12 hidden nodes and 2 output nodes is used. This paper describes the performance of the network for AC and DC faults due to changes in number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the layer, learning rate and momentum. Dynamic characteristics of networks for different configurations are studied too. The time performance of the network is also included. Neural networks provide an effective way for fault diagnosis and identification. Simulation data obtained from the EMTP are used to test the performance of this network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","startPage":"231","endPage":"236 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1183/7233/00292717.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault identification in HVDC systems with neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC power transmission","Simulation","Fault location","Learning systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC power transmission","digital simulation","fault location","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC systems","neural networks","fault identification","simulation","fault diagnosis","input data patterns","time varying patterns","conducting thyristors","DC fault characteristics","AC fault characteristics","hidden nodes","hidden layers","learning rate","dynamic characteristics","time performance","EMTP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fault identification in HVDC systems with neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4695706","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault identification in HVDC systems with neural networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong","sourcePdf":"00292717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08417S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec 1993","isNumber":"7233","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1183","citationCount":"2","articleId":"292717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":292727,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Jing Shi"},{"name":"Longjian Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Longjian Cao"},{"name":"Tek Tjing Lie","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Tek Tjing Lie"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-85296-569-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"292727","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation","Feedback","Neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","control system synthesis","feedback","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","power system analysis computing","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power systems","artificial neural networks","nonlinear control design","one-axis model","robust stabilizer design","controller","state feedback linearizer","backpropagation network","training","parametric uncertainties","control parameters","synchronous generator"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel3/1183/7233/00292727.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 2nd International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-93.","startPage":"290","endPage":"292 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear stabilizer design in power systems using neural network","abstract":"Many applications of artificial neural networks (ANN) have been attempted in control systems.

This allows the use of a smaller receiving antenna and results in lowering the cost per service delivered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings National Telesystems Conference 1993","pdfPath":"/iel3/1074/7237/00292998.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings National Telesystems Conference 1993","doi":"10.1109/NTC.1993.292998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTC.1993.292998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of coded QPSK modulation for the delivery of MPEG-2 stream compared to analog FM modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Modulation coding","Video compression","Frequency modulation","Transform coding","Phase shift keying","Satellites","Motion pictures","Concatenated codes","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","digital communication systems","direct broadcasting by satellite","image coding","phase shift keying","telecommunication services","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded QPSK modulation","MPEG-2 stream","analog FM modulation","coded quadrature phase-shift keying","video services","digital video scheme","Motion Picture Experts Group","video compression","concatenated coding","video channels","receiving antenna","cost per service delivered"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/292998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance of coded QPSK modulation for the delivery of MPEG-2 stream compared to analog FM modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4663947","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-17 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of coded QPSK modulation for the delivery of MPEG-2 stream compared to analog FM modulation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00292998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022336S","chronDate":"16-17 Jun 1993","isNumber":"7237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1074","articleId":"292998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":293018,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

These effects modify the ideal linear relationship between the inverter propagation delay and the input ramp rise/fall time by adding a term proportional to the charge supplied by the short-circuiting transistor. This term is shown to contain first- and second-order contributions of the input ramp rise/fall time where the second-order contribution effectively models the propagation delay roll-off for slow input ramps. Both the first and the second-order effects are found to be affected by the P-to-N-channel gain ratio. The model shows excellent agreement with SPICE level 3 simulations; even when the short-circuiting transistor has a driving capability twice that of the charging/discharging transistor the error in the propagation delay is only about 2% for a slow input ramp (input-to-output slope-ratio at V/sub DD//2 equal to 1:2).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.293109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7239","startPage":"646","endPage":"654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7239/00293109.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the influence of the transistor gain ratio and the input-to-output coupling capacitance on the CMOS inverter delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling the influence of the transistor gain ratio and the input-to-output coupling capacitance on the CMOS inverter delay","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4722384","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the influence of the transistor gain ratio and the input-to-output coupling capacitance on the CMOS inverter delay","sourcePdf":"00293109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034964S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"90","articleId":"293109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":293110,"authors":[{"name":"P.

By virtue of the time digitization architecture used, the average power dissipation of the cell is only 19.8 mW, despite the use of circuits that dissipate static power, and the layout area is a compact 448 /spl mu/m/spl times/634 /spl mu/m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.293117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7239/00293117.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.293117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BiCMOS time interval digitizer based on fully-differential, current-steering circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293117/","displayDocTitle":"A BiCMOS time interval digitizer based on fully-differential, current-steering circuits","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4722392","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BiCMOS time interval digitizer based on fully-differential, current-steering circuits","sourcePdf":"00293117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047952S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"293117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":293118,"authors":[{"name":"T.

After amplification in one array, the charges in that array are transferred to another array, where they are recycled for half amplification. The data-line current dissipation is only half that of the conventional refresh operation, and the voltage bounce of the power supply line is 60% of the conventional. This scheme is further extended for application to n arrays with 1/n data-line current dissipation. Moreover, the multi-array activation with charge recycle refresh is proposed, in which the same peak current as in the conventional scheme is achieved with a small number of refresh cycles for refreshing all the cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recycling","Random access memory","Voltage","Leakage current","Power dissipation","Circuits","Testing","Power supplies","Personal digital assistants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","VLSI","electric charge","file servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge recycle refresh","Gb-scale DRAM's","file applications","low-power DRAM data-retention","memory arrays","64 kb test chip","0.25 /spl mu/m technology","amplification","half amplification","data-line current dissipation","voltage bounce","power supply line","multi-array activation","peak current","0.25 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293118","doi":"10.1109/4.293118","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7239/00293118.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.293118","startPage":"715","endPage":"722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A charge recycle refresh for Gb-scale DRAM's in file applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A charge recycle refresh for Gb-scale DRAM's in file applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293118/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4722393","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A charge recycle refresh for Gb-scale DRAM's in file applications","sourcePdf":"00293118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040569S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"11","articleId":"293118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":293120,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Gang Yang","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"lastName":"Hai-Gang Yang","id":"37087168661"},{"name":"S.

The multiplier uses the square-law characteristic of an MOS transistor in saturation. Its major advantage over other four-quadrant multipliers is its combination of small area and low power consumption. In addition, unlike almost all other designs of four-quadrant multipliers, this design has single ended inputs so that the inputs do not need to be pre-processed before being fed to the multiplier, thus saving additional area. These properties make the multiplier very suitable for use in the implementation of artificial neural networks. The design was fabricated through MOSIS using the standard 2 /spl mu/m CMOS process.

The relaxation algorithms have been studied by various authors for the deterministic case. Convergence conditions of this algorithm are based on fixed point theorems. For example, Basar (1987) and Li and Basar (1987) have proved its convergence for a two-player game via the contraction mapping theorem. For the quadratic case these conditions can be easily checked. For other nonlinear payoff functions it is sometimes difficult to check these convergence conditions. In this paper, the authors propose an alternative approach using the residual terms of the Nikaido-Isoda function. The convergence theorem is proved for nonsmooth weakly convex-concave Nikaido-Isoda functions. The family of weakly convex-concave functions is broad enough for applications, since if includes the family of smooth functions. When the payoff functions are twice continuously differentiable, the condition for the residual terms is reduced to strict positiveness of a matrix representing the difference of the Hessians of the Nikaido-Isoda function with respect to the first and second groups of variables. An analogous condition was used by Uryas'ev (1988) to prove convergence of the gradient-type algorithm for the Nash equilibrium problem. In this paper the authors discuss only the deterministic case; nevertheless this approach can be generalized for the stochastic Nash equilibrium problems with uncertainties in parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.293193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.293193","endPage":"1267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7242/00293193.pdf","startPage":"1263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On relaxation algorithms in computation of noncooperative equilibria","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293193/","displayDocTitle":"On relaxation algorithms in computation of noncooperative equilibria","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4727743","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On relaxation algorithms in computation of noncooperative equilibria","sourcePdf":"00293193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029283S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"92","articleId":"293193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293198,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Chun Wu","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Chun Wu","id":"37087278514"},{"name":"Nie-Zen Yen","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Nie-Zen Yen","id":"37087807659"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"293198","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"In a general command tracking and disturbance rejection problem, it is known that a sampled-data controller using zero-order hold may only guarantee the asymptotic tracking at the sampling instances, but cannot smooth out the ripples between the sampling instances. In this paper, a sampled-data robust servomechanism controller using exponential hold is developed for guaranteeing the asymptotic tracking not only at, but also between, the sampling instances. In this development, a so called \"internally-reducible\" condition to characterize a class of robust servomechanism controllers is derived first, then the proposed controller is shown to be contained in this class. Generally speaking, a sampled-data structure using exponential hold can provide more design freedoms so that it tends to simplify the construction of a robust servomechanism controller and facilitate the implementation on digital computers. An example for a DC motor control is presented to illustrate the advantages of this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Servomechanisms","Sampling methods","Computer errors","Steady-state","State feedback","DC motors","Robustness","Permission","Digital control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability","sampled data systems","servomechanisms","tracking","control system synthesis","DC motors","machine control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ripple free sampled-data robust servomechanism controller","exponential hold","command tracking","disturbance rejection","asymptotic tracking","sampling instances","internally-reducible condition","DC motor control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.293198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7242/00293198.pdf","startPage":"1287","endPage":"1291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.293198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ripple free sampled-data robust servomechanism controller using exponential hold","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A ripple free sampled-data robust servomechanism controller using exponential hold","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293198/","volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4727748","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ripple free sampled-data robust servomechanism controller using exponential hold","sourcePdf":"00293198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031905S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"5","articleId":"293198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":293202,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Chuang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Chuang Chen","id":"37349925700"},{"name":"Chen-Chung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Chung Liu","id":"37384614600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"293202","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":225,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":501},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Neural networks","Nonhomogeneous media","Control system synthesis","Adaptive control","Control nonlinearities","Polynomials","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","nonlinear control systems","feedforward neural nets","control nonlinearities","learning (artificial intelligence)","feedback","intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear continuous time systems","multilayer neural networks","adaptive control","feedback linearizable continuous time system","reference command tracking","control nonlinearities","gradient learning rule","dead zone","SISO systems"]}],"abstract":"Multilayer neural networks are used in a nonlinear adaptive control problem.

Furthermore, the guaranteed cost can be optimized by appropriately searching a scaling design parameter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Kalman filtering for uncertain discrete-time systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.293203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7242/00293203.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.293203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Robust Kalman filtering for uncertain discrete-time systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4733135","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Kalman filtering for uncertain discrete-time systems","sourcePdf":"00293203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03316S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"379","articleId":"293203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":293207,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Assuming the end point of the manipulator is guided, e.g., by a human operator to follow an arbitrary trajectory, it is desirable that the mobile platform is able to move as to position the manipulator in certain preferred configurations. Since the motion of the manipulator is unknown a priori, the platform has to use the measured joint position information of the manipulator for its own motion planning. This paper presents a control algorithm for the platform so that the manipulator is always positioned at the preferred configurations measured by its manipulability. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm. The algorithm is also implemented and verified on a real mobile manipulator system. The use of the resulting algorithm in a number of applications is also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.293207","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7242/00293207.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.293207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinating locomotion and manipulation of a mobile manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Integral equations","Nonlinear equations","Filtering theory","Motion measurement","Position measurement","Displacement control","Motion control","Indium tin oxide","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","position control","feedback","dynamics","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locomotion coordination","mobile manipulator","mobile platform","joint position information","motion planning","manipulability","robots","feedback control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Coordinating locomotion and manipulation of a mobile manipulator","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4727754","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinating locomotion and manipulation of a mobile manipulator","sourcePdf":"00293207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048605S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"240","articleId":"293207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":293224,"authors":[{"name":"H.

With this technique, the diagnosis from a specialist and the emergency care under his/her instructions would be available on the spot without unnecessary delay. The characteristic problems of this technique were identified as: channel capacity, size of the system, reliability of vital sign transmission, real-time operation and electromagnetic interference. Measures against these problems were devised, and their effectiveness was analyzed. A data format was designed and an experimental system was developed. The system can simultaneously transmit a color image, an audio signal, 3 channels ECG and blood pressures from a mobile station to a ground station. It can transmit an audio signal and error control signals from a ground station to a mobile station in a full duplex mode. Fundamental transmission characteristics were measured in a fixed station. Finally, experiments of medical data transmission were conducted with a navigating ship and an aircraft flying an international route. The measured threshold values of C/N/sub o/ to guarantee satisfactory data reception were well below the lower boundary of C/N/sub o/ of the communication link. Consequently, the feasibility of this technique was verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/7243/00293224.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.293224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.293224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Telemedicine using mobile satellite communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemedicine","Satellite communication","Satellite ground stations","Aircraft navigation","Vehicles","Delay","Channel capacity","Real time systems","Electromagnetic interference","Electromagnetic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patient diagnosis","patient care","emergency services","mobile radio systems","satellite relay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile satellite communication","telemedicine","paramedical care","moving vehicles","emergency care","channel capacity","system size","vital sign transmission reliability","real-time operation","electromagnetic interference","data format","color image transmission","audio signal","3-channels ECG","blood pressure","mobile station","ground station","error control signals","full duplex mode","fixed station","navigating ship","aircraft"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Aircraft","Computer Systems","Feasibility Studies","Reproducibility of Results","Satellite Communications","Ships","Telemedicine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1994","displayDocTitle":"Telemedicine using mobile satellite communication","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4733183","pubMedId":"8070809","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telemedicine using mobile satellite communication","sourcePdf":"00293224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086661S","chronDate":"May  1994","isNumber":"7243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"44","articleId":"293224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":293238,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

We present here the first complete physically based explanation of the bipolar gain mechanism, and its dependence on bias and technological parameters. A simple, one-dimensional physical model, with no fitting parameters, is constructed, and is shown to agree well with simulations and measurements performed on a new type of SOI MOSFET structure. It is shown that parameters which affect the gain, such as SOI layer thickness, body doping concentration and gate and drain voltages, do so primarily by affecting the concentration of holes in the body region. Thus, current gain falls dramatically with increasing drain voltage due to the associated impact ionization driven increase in the hole concentration. Gummel plots of this parasitic bipolar indicate an apparent ideality factor of 0.5 for the hole current, due to the body hole concentration's dependence on drain voltage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4727776","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parasitic bipolar gain in fully depleted n-channel SOI MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parasitic bipolar gain in fully depleted n-channel SOI MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00293310.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058312S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"44","articleId":"293310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":293314,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The observed damage includes early breakdowns, excessive leakage current, an increase in interface states, and a decrease in charge-to-breakdown value. Moreover, annealing and polarity results support a hole trapping model for damage. In addition, it was found that the percentage of breakdown failure increases as the oxide quality decreases, In particular, the observed damage can increase up to 30 times when the initial oxide is degraded before plasma exposure according to how the oxide is prepared and annealed. This is important since it helps to explain how different process steps interact to affect the final yield. For instance a previous plasma process step may degrade an oxide and make it much more susceptible to damage by a subsequent plasma step.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4727784","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Oxide damage from plasma charging: breakdown mechanism and oxide quality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oxide damage from plasma charging: breakdown mechanism and oxide quality","sourcePdf":"00293318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035549S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"28","articleId":"293318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293334,"authors":[{"name":"I.C.

Electrical stress experiments are performed on transistors with different base doping profiles at varying temperatures. Detailed process simulations are performed to determine the doping profiles of the base-emitter junction. Monte Carlo transport simulations are then performed at different temperatures and bias conditions to determine the electron and hole distribution functions in the base-emitter junction. AT&T's 0.8 /spl mu/m BICMOS technology is used to fabricate the experimental bipolar structures. For this non-self aligned technology we attribute h/sub FE/ degradation to the presence of hot holes and secondary electrons which are generated by hot hole impact ionization. This feedback due to impact ionization has a dominant effect on the high energy tails of the distribution of both holes and electrons even when the overall current multiplication is low. Simple hot electron energy transport models do not contain the complexity to properly describe ionization feedback and carrier heating, and are therefore inadequate. An exponential dependence of the transistor lifetime on BV/sub EBO/ is deduced for constant voltage stress (V/sub stress/<BV/sub EBO/) conditions, confirming the importance of secondaries in the process of degradation.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","volume":"41","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747152","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of gain in bipolar transistors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of gain in bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00293334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056072S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","articleId":"293334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293343,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongming Shi","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhongming Shi","id":"37366133000"},{"name":"J.-P.

RTS are explained both by number and mobility fluctuations due to single electron trapping in the gate oxide. The role of the type of the trap (acceptor or donor), the distance of the trap from the Si-SiO/sub 2/ interface, the channel electron concentration (which is set by the gate bias) and the electron mobility (which is affected by the drain voltage) is demonstrated. The effect of capture and emission on average electron mobility is demonstrated for the first time. A simple theoretical model explains the observed effect of electron heating on electron capture. The mean capture time depends on the local velocity and the nonequilibrium temperature of channel electrons near the trap. The difference between the forward and reverse modes (source and drain exchanged) provides an estimate of the effective trap location along the channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.293343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7248/00293343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.293343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7248","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random telegraph signals in deep submicron n-MOSFET's","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random telegraph signals in deep submicron n-MOSFET's","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747161","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random telegraph signals in deep submicron n-MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00293343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073827S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"95","articleId":"293343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293352,"authors":[{"name":"K.F.

A method is developed here to avoid these errors. The method is tested both in practice and with simulations. Two parts can be distinguished. At first, the timebase distortion is measured. This is done by digitizing a sinusoidal signal applied at the oscilloscope's input, and by calculating the phase of the analytical signal of the digitized waveform. Other possible methods to measure the timebase distortion are discussed, and it is shown why the method used is the most appropriate for our specific application. The knowledge of the timebase distortion is then used to build a least squares error estimator for the values of the spectral components of a digitized microwave signal. An experimental verification is done, from which is concluded that the method effectively removes the spectral estimation errors due to a timebase distortion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion measurement","Sampling methods","Oscilloscopes","Discrete Fourier transforms","Microwave measurements","Estimation error","Signal analysis","Least squares approximation","Phase measurement","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","spectral analysis","time bases","oscilloscopes","microwave measurement","analogue-digital conversion","electric distortion","electric distortion measurement","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral estimation","distorted-timebase digitizer","timebase distortion","equivalent-time sampling oscilloscope","spectral components","classical discrete Fourier transform","sinusoidal signal","least squares error estimator","digitized microwave signal","errors removal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.293422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/7250/00293422.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.293422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate spectral estimation based on measurements with a distorted-timebase digitizer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate spectral estimation based on measurements with a distorted-timebase digitizer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293422/","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4747230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate spectral estimation based on measurements with a distorted-timebase digitizer","sourcePdf":"00293422.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036584S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"46","articleId":"293422","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":293427,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Digital iterative feedback is used to make the system insensitive to gain variations of the sampling gates. The method resembles that of dc substitution, but with vector capabilities, and is responsible for the high stability of the system. Furthermore, digital processing of the IF signals avoids the various IF imperfections of conventional vector analyzers such as gain range errors and detector circularity errors, which explains the exceptional linearity of the system.

The method is based on the fact that, when the oscilloscope is sampling a dc voltage, pulses are launched from the sampler towards the input connector. These pulses contain information on the scope's characteristic and can be measured by a second oscilloscope. This type of measurement is called a \"nose-to-nose\" calibration. Applying deconvolution techniques to the result of this measurement, the characteristic of the two scopes can be found, assuming that the two scopes are identical. To avoid relying on this assumption, three oscilloscopes can be used. The nose-to-nose is then applied three times, with a different pair of scopes connected together each time. The individual characteristics of the three sampling oscilloscopes are then calculated. Both SPICE simulations and close correspondence between swept-sine measurements and this method indicate that it is probably the most accurate method available at this moment to calibrate broadband sampling oscilloscopes. Several measurement uncertainties and practical problems are identified. The phase contribution of the sampling aperture can never be determined by this method, but there is strong evidence that the effect is negligible. Practical measurement problems are related to linearity of the samplers, additive noise, time-base jitter, and time-base drift.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.293446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/7250/00293446.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.293446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Individual characterization of broadband sampling oscilloscopes with a nose-to-nose calibration procedure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293446/","displayDocTitle":"Individual characterization of broadband sampling oscilloscopes with a nose-to-nose calibration procedure","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4747254","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Individual characterization of broadband sampling oscilloscopes with a nose-to-nose calibration procedure","sourcePdf":"00293446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041338S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"82","articleId":"293446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293449,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Due to the rugged terrain surface of the search space, it often gets stuck at a locally optimum configuration. In this paper, we give a local search method with a search space smoothing technique. It is capable of smoothing the rugged terrain surface of the search space. Any conventional heuristic search algorithm can be used in conjunction with this smoothing method. In a parameter space, by altering the shape of the objective function, the original problem instance is transformed into a series of gradually simplified problem instances with smoother terrain surfaces. Using an existing local search algorithm, an instance with the simplest terrain structure is solved first, the original problem instance with more complicated terrain structure is solved last, and the solutions of the simplified problem instances are used to guide the search of more complicated ones. A case study of using such technique to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is described. We tested this method with numerous randomly generated TSP instances. We found that it has significantly improved the performance of existing heuristic search algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.293486","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7252/00293486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.293486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7252","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"728","endPage":"735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient local search with search space smoothing: a case study of the traveling salesman problem (TSP)","volume":"24","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4733234","publicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient local search with search space smoothing: a case study of the traveling salesman problem (TSP)","sourcePdf":"00293486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074953S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"73","articleId":"293486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293489,"authors":[{"name":"W.N.

Due to the real world environment and implementation constraints, different problems require different evaluation criteria such as: accuracy, training time, sensitivity, and the number of neurons used. Tradeoffs exist between these measures, and compromises are needed in order to achieve an acceptable network design. This paper presents a method using fuzzy logic techniques to adapt the current network configuration to one which is close to (if not at) the optimal configuration. The fuzzy logic provides a method of systematically changing the network configuration while simultaneously considering all of the evaluation criteria. The optimal configuration is determined by a cost function based on the evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology is applied to an elementary classifier network as an illustration. The procedure is then used to automatically configure a network used to detect incipient faults in an induction motor as a real world application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.293489","startPage":"760","endPage":"768","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7252/00293489.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.293489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology using fuzzy logic to optimize feedforward artificial neural network configurations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Optimization methods","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Cost function","Fault detection","Appropriate technology","Induction motors","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","feedforward neural nets","sensitivity","learning (artificial intelligence)","induction motors","fault location"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","feedforward artificial neural network configurations","evaluation criteria","accuracy","training time","sensitivity","optimal configuration","elementary classifier network","induction motor","fault detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"A methodology using fuzzy logic to optimize feedforward artificial neural network configurations","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4733237","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology using fuzzy logic to optimize feedforward artificial neural network configurations","sourcePdf":"00293489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078335S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"31","articleId":"293489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":293490,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

The distribution of the random payoff is unknown to the players and further none of the players know the strategies or the actual moves of other players. A learning algorithm for the game based on a decentralized team of learning automata is presented. It is proved that all stable stationary points of the algorithm are Nash equilibria for the game. Two special cases of the game are also discussed, namely, game with common payoff and the relaxation labelling problem. The former has applications such as pattern recognition and the latter is a problem widely studied in computer vision. For the two special cases it is shown that the algorithm always converges to a desirable solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.293490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/7252/00293490.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.293490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized learning of Nash equilibria in multi-person stochastic games with incomplete information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293490/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized learning of Nash equilibria in multi-person stochastic games with incomplete information","volume":"24","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4733238","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized learning of Nash equilibria in multi-person stochastic games with incomplete information","sourcePdf":"00293490.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043451S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"206","articleId":"293490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":293491,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Tao Wang","id":"37383558000"},{"name":"Xinhua Zhuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Xinhua Zhuang","id":"37274680600"},{"name":"Xiaoliang Xing","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoliang Xing","id":"37383085100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"293491","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnesium compounds","Associative memory","Learning systems","Symmetric matrices","Convergence","Asymptotic stability","Neural networks","Robustness","Parallel machines","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","content-addressable storage","stability","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional associative memories","optimal stability","learning algorithm","objective function","global minimization problem","gradient descent technique","basins of attraction","storage capacity","convergence","asymptotic stability","training pattern"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a learning algorithm for bidirectional associative memories (BAM's) with optimal stability is presented.

Three types of networks were discussed: a multilayer feedforward network trained using the backpropagation algorithm, a sum-of-products network trained with a modification of backpropagation, and a new hybrid architecture that combines the two. A maximum classification accuracy of 97.5% was achieved using a neural network based pattern classifier.

Various types of ceramics have been successfully sintered and, in some cases, a desirable and unique \"microwave effect\" has been observed. At present, various aspects of the sintering profess such as preparation of sample sizes and shapes, types of insulations, and the desirability of including a process stimulus such as SiC rods are considered forms of art and highly dependent on human expertise. The simulation of realistic sintering experiments in a multimode cavity may provide an improved understanding of critical parameters involved and allow for the development of guidelines towards the optimization of the sintering process. In this paper, we utilize the FDTD technique to model various geometrical arrangements and material compatibility aspects in multimode microwave cavities and to simulate realistic sintering experiments. The FDTD procedure starts with the simulation of a field distribution in multimode microwave cavities that resembles a set of measured data using liquid crystal sheets. Also included in the simulation is the waveguide feed as well as a ceramic loading plate placed at the base of the cavity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.293527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7254/00293527.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.293527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD simulation of microwave sintering of ceramics in multimode cavities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293527/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD simulation of microwave sintering of ceramics in multimode cavities","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4733149","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD simulation of microwave sintering of ceramics in multimode cavities","sourcePdf":"00293527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028649S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","articleId":"293527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293529,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The limitations of the traditional frequency-conversion approach to noise analysis are overcome. The analysis takes into account the thermal noise generated in the passive subnetwork, the noise contributions of linear and nonlinear active devices, and the noise injected by sinusoidal driving sources of known statistical properties.

On the other hand, the proper performance of the technique has been verified (stability of the algorithm, accuracy of results) for modes of high angular dependence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.293538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7254/00293538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.293538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7254","startPage":"870","endPage":"874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD method coupled with FFT: A generalization to open cylindrical devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD method coupled with FFT: A generalization to open cylindrical devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4733160","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD method coupled with FFT: A generalization to open cylindrical devices","sourcePdf":"00293538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064031S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"18","articleId":"293538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":293546,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

Baseband modulation is done through frequency shift keying and signal detection is accomplished by a noncoherent type receiver. The quality of a signal is affected by the channel noise, multiuser interference, and multipath interference. Performance analysis is conducted on the basis of bit error rate. Due to the sophistication of the system exact analysis is not feasible. The accuracy of approximation is checked against simulations. One major discovery Is that when signal-to-noise ratio is low, multipath interference on the contrary may help to enhance the quality of the signal. Another discovery is that when signal-to-noise ratio is high enough, multipath/multiuser interference becomes the bottleneck of performance. The effect of channel noise can be eliminated by maintaining a large signal-to-noise ratio while spread spectrum technique is employed to reduce the effect of multipath/multiuser interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.293639","startPage":"211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7257/00293639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.293639","endPage":"222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using frequency hopping spread spectrum technique to combat multipath interference in a multiaccessing environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Using frequency hopping spread spectrum technique to combat multipath interference in a multiaccessing environment","volume":"43","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4727858","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using frequency hopping spread spectrum technique to combat multipath interference in a multiaccessing environment","sourcePdf":"00293639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055416S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","articleId":"293639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":293640,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

Three main contributions are given. First, analysis is presented which shows that adjacent channel power is a quadratic function of power amplifier nonlinearity as well as quadrature modulator errors. Quadrature modulator errors are gain imbalance, phase splitter error, and DC offset errors. Second, a new optimization method is given which uses the predicted adjacent channel power surface to obtain fast convergence. Third, simulation and measured results are given for an adaptive system using offset QPSK modulation. The measured results confirm the analysis and show that a 20-dB reduction in adjacent channel power is achievable. In general, the adaptive direct conversion transmitter has applications in any system where power efficiency and spectral efficiency are important, and allows the use of smaller more efficient power amplifiers in a direct conversion architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.293640","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7257/00293640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.293640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7257","startPage":"223","endPage":"233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive direct conversion transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive direct conversion transmitter","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4727859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive direct conversion transmitter","sourcePdf":"00293640.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047825S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"52","articleId":"293640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293646,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.H.

The example scheme considered here is the ordered channel search, which can achieve a reasonably high spectral efficiency as compared to that of an ideal dynamic channel allocation algorithm. We conclude that our neural network approach is well-suited to the dynamic channel allocation problem of future cellular or microcellular systems with decentralized control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4727865","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based dynamic channel assignment for cellular mobile communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based dynamic channel assignment for cellular mobile communication systems","sourcePdf":"00293646.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034971S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"58","articleId":"293646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":293647,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"lastName":"Gang Wu","id":"37277675200"},{"name":"K.

By using the equilibrium point analysis (EPA), a PRMA integrated voice and data system has been studied in previous research. However, the error between numerical results of the analysis and those of simulation is relatively large. In this paper, we also study an integrated voice and data system with PRMA. The system performance is evaluated by using a Markov analysis method. First, some analytic models are constructed such that the system transition can be described by a Markov chain. Then, we calculate the entries of the one step state transition matrix using an iterative procedure. Finally, system performance measures, such as throughput and delay, are evaluated. Little error between numerical results of analysis and those of simulation indicates that the method is appropriate to analyze PRMA systems,.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.293647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7257","startPage":"289","endPage":"297","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7257/00293647.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of an integrated voice and data transmission system using packet reservation multiple access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of an integrated voice and data transmission system using packet reservation multiple access","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4727866","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of an integrated voice and data transmission system using packet reservation multiple access","sourcePdf":"00293647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042456S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"48","articleId":"293647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":293651,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The system, which can handle a 30 dB power control range, uses a digital signal processing microprocessor and memory look-up tables to predistort the baseband drive signals. Low data rate services such as are found in mobile satellite applications (<8.5 kbits/s) can be handled by this digital signal processing approach. Higher bit rates can be obtained with some software modifications and any further increase would require a more hardware intensive solution. The system gives a 30 dB improvement in IM/sub 3/ of a class B stage using a standard two-tone test. An improvement of 25 dB when using /spl pi//4-shift-QPSK modulation is obtained with a sample rate of B times the symbol rate. Experimental results show that AM to AM correction is much more important than AM to PM correction and in some cases this can lead to further simplifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive linearization using predistortion-experimental results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.293651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7257/00293651.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.293651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive linearization using predistortion-experimental results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4727870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive linearization using predistortion-experimental results","sourcePdf":"00293651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051982S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"120","articleId":"293651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293655,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

The sense in which reliability is measured is addressed, and in the interesting eases where the decoding delay constraint plays a significant role, the maximal achievable rate (capacity), is specified in terms of capacity versus outage. In this case, no coding capacity in the strict Shannon sense exists. Simple schemes for time and space diversity are examined, and their potential benefits are illuminated from an information-theoretic stand point. In our presentation, we chose to specialize to the TDMA protocol for the sake of clarity and convenience. Our main arguments and results extend directly to certain variants of other multiple access protocols such as code division multiple access (CDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), provided that no fast feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.293655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.293655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/7257/00293655.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information theoretic considerations for cellular mobile radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Information theoretic considerations for cellular mobile radio","volume":"43","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4727874","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293655/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information theoretic considerations for cellular mobile radio","sourcePdf":"00293655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075096S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"770","articleId":"293655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":293656,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yuanqing","affiliation":["Guangzhou Communication Research Institute, Ministry of Electronics Industry, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Li Yuanqing","id":"37373388900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"293656","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The random characteristics of multipath delay spread in a land mobile radio environment are analyzed.

We demonstrate that the receiver can operate when the multipath coefficients vary in time (Doppler spread).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive parameter estimation using parallel Kalman filtering for spread spectrum code and doppler tracking","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.293672","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7258/00293672.pdf","startPage":"2227","endPage":"2230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.293672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive parameter estimation using parallel Kalman filtering for spread spectrum code and doppler tracking","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive parameter estimation using parallel Kalman filtering for spread spectrum code and doppler tracking","sourcePdf":"00293672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1056S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","articleId":"293672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":293675,"authors":[{"name":"Robert H.

The concatenated coded modulation is formed by cascading a ReedSolomon (RS) outer code and a block coded modulation (BCM) inner code. In both schemes, the coded modulation decoder, by performing sequence combining and soft-decision maximum likelihood decoding, makes full use of the information available in all received sequences corresponding to a given information message. It is shown, by means of analysis as well as computer simulations, that both schemes are capable of providing high throughput efficiencies over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

The adaptive scheme employs a slightly modified rate 1/2 convolutional encoder and the corresponding Viterbi decoder to realize a family of codes of different rates which are employed according to channel conditions. During poor channel conditions, trellis-coded QPSK (TCQPSK) together with repetition schemes are employed. As channel conditions improve, higher rate schemes such as trellis-coded 16 PSK are used. An interleaving/ deinterleaving method suitable for the adaptive scheme is proposed. Theoretical bounds for the error performance and an exact expression for the throughput of the proposed adaptive scheme are derived, and are compared against simulation results. Simulations have been performed to measure the performance of the scheme for different parameters and some nonideal conditions. It is shown that ATCMPSK results in considerable improvement in bit-error-rate (BER) performance of MPSK signals. Under ideal conditions, gains in the range of 3-20 dB are achieved over conventional fixed rate pragmatic trellis-coded schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive trellis-coded multiple-phase-shift keying for Rayleigh fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive trellis-coded multiple-phase-shift keying for Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00293682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021045S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"135","articleId":"293682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293683,"authors":[{"name":"Jan W.M.

This \u201crestricted delay bound\u201d is governed by a \u201crestricted-delay distance\u201d d(\u03b4).

A 1.5 kW proof-of-concept laboratory prototype is used to investigate the feasibility of the proposed variable-speed generation principle. Experimental results show that the prototype system can achieve high efficiency over a range of speeds. The system efficiencies achieved at the power levels considered compare favorably with conventional squirrel cage induction machines. It is experimentally demonstrated that the brushless doubly-fed system achieves variable-speed operation with a power converter of reduced rating. For the prototype under consideration, a 2:1 speed range can be covered with a power converter rated at approximately 25% of system capacity. While reactive power control can be realized with the proposed system, the magnitude is limited by the desired low power converter rating. The prototype system also is also shown to exhibit excellent output current waveforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.293713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/7259/00293713.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"655","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293713.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.293713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation of a variable-speed, doubly-fed wind-power generation system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293713/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation of a variable-speed, doubly-fed wind-power generation system","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1994","accessionNumber":"4733294","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation of a variable-speed, doubly-fed wind-power generation system","sourcePdf":"00293713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059157S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1994","isNumber":"7259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"70","articleId":"293713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":293716,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A much larger air gap, compared with that of the existing PM motors, is utilized to reduce the slot ripples and hence the resultant eddy current loss in the metallic sleeve that retains the permanent magnets, otherwise this loss would be objectionable at such high speeds. The motor is supplied from a quasi-current source inverter with the DC current controlled by a chopper and operated at a near unity power factor by the use of a simple position sensor-less control, to improve the motor efficiency. The analytic results are presented to show the slot ripple reducing effect of increasing the air gap length. To investigate the losses of the sleeve, several motors with different sleeves were manufactured and tested. Typical experimental results on these prototypes are given, which show that motor efficiency of higher than 90% can be realized at the rated torque over a wide speed range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.293717","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293717.png","startPage":"683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/7259/00293717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.293717","endPage":"690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A super high speed PM motor drive system by a quasi-current source inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A super high speed PM motor drive system by a quasi-current source inverter","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4733298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A super high speed PM motor drive system by a quasi-current source inverter","sourcePdf":"00293717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03013S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1994","isNumber":"7259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"88","articleId":"293717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293875,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Hwan Kim","id":"37087151010"},{"name":"Jong-Hwan Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Hwan Park","id":"37087300197"},{"name":"Seon-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seon-Woo Lee","id":"37087272734"},{"name":"E.K.P.

The two-layered control structure consists of a fuzzy logic-based precompensator followed by a usual fuzzy PD controller. Our proposed controller exhibits superior transient and steady-state performance compared to usual fuzzy PD controllers. In addition, the controller is robust to variations in deadzone nonlinearities.

The minimization of the quadratic error is computed by a variable step gradient method. Another multilayer recurrent neural network is added to estimate the joint accelerations.

The controlled transfer of energy from a unregulated DC source to a regulated output voltage is realized through a switched-capacitor (SC) circuit. A duty-cycle control is used; the driving signals of the transistors in the SC circuit are determined by the feedback circuit. The absence of magnetic devices makes possible the realization of power converters of small size, low weight and high power density, able to be manufactured in IC technology. High efficiency, small output voltage ripple and good regulation for large changes in the input voltage and/or load values are other positive features of the new type of DC-to-DC power converter. The input-to-output voltage conversion ratio is flexible; the same converter structure can provide a large range of constant desired values of the output voltage for a given input voltage, by predetermining the steady-state conversion ratio. The frequency response shows good stability of the designed converter. The experimental results obtained by using a prototype of a step-down SC-based DC-to-DC converter confirmed the theoretical expectations and the computer simulation results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293881.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/7262/00293881.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.293881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.293881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inductorless DC-to-DC converter with high power density","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Feedback circuits","Power supplies","Inductors","Transformers","Voltage control","Switching circuits","Magnetic devices","Manufacturing","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","switched mode power supplies","switched capacitor networks","power transistors","power integrated circuits","frequency response","voltage control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-to-DC power converter","power density","switching mode power supply","inductorless","output voltage control","switched capacitor circuit","duty cycle control","transistors","feedback circuit","size","weight","power IC","efficiency","output voltage ripple","steady-state conversion ratio","frequency response","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Inductorless DC-to-DC converter with high power density","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4727110","dateOfInsertion":"13 April 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inductorless DC-to-DC converter with high power density","sourcePdf":"293881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031708S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"163","articleId":"293881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":293896,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

This proposed parallel adaptive neural network control system is applicable to nonlinear dynamical systems of the type commonly encountered in many practical position control servomechanisms. Properties of the controller are discussed, and it is shown that if Gaussian radial basis function networks are used for the additional parallel neural network, uniformly stable adaptation is assured and the approximation error converges to zero asymptotically. In the paper, the effectiveness of the proposed parallel adaptive neural network control system is demonstrated in real-time implementation experiments for position control in a servomechanism with asymmetrical loading and changes in the load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.293896","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293896.png","startPage":"269","endPage":"277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7263/00293896.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.293896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network control system with parallel adaptive enhancements applicable to nonlinear servomechanisms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Position control","Servomechanisms","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["servomechanisms","nonlinear systems","feedforward neural nets","adaptive control","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network control system","parallel adaptive enhancements","nonlinear servomechanisms","nonlinear dynamical systems","position control servomechanisms","Gaussian radial basis function networks","uniformly stable adaptation","approximation error asymptotic convergence","real-time implementation","position control","asymmetrical loading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network control system with parallel adaptive enhancements applicable to nonlinear servomechanisms","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4727118","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network control system with parallel adaptive enhancements applicable to nonlinear servomechanisms","sourcePdf":"00293896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045351S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","articleId":"293896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":293897,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

For the same real power consumed, the apparent power for the distorted load is greater than the equivalent sinusoidal load. A real-time active filter optimization algorithm has been implemented in a TMS320C30 DSP, with the aim of maximizing the monetary saving from active filtering by reducing the apparent power consumed at the point of supply. As the basis for this optimization a savings function which takes into account active filter efficiency, the cost of energy, and the supply and load current distortion before and after filtering, has been derived. A simplex optimization technique, which is able to find the optimum operating point even under varying load conditions, is used to maximize these energy savings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.293897","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293897.png","startPage":"278","endPage":"284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7263/00293897.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.293897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time optimization of an active filter's performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Current supplies","Filtering","Power harmonic filters","Signal processing algorithms","Power system harmonics","Power electronics","Costs","Control systems","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power electronics","active filters","optimisation","digital signal processing chips","energy conservation","power supply quality","real-time systems","economics","semiconductor device manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filter performance optimisation","power electronics","distorted current","power supply","apparent power","equivalent sinusoidal load","TMS320C30 DSP","monetary saving","active filter efficiency","energy cost","optimum operating point","energy savings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Real-time optimization of an active filter's performance","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4727119","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time optimization of an active filter's performance","sourcePdf":"00293897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042774S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","articleId":"293897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":293898,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Sinusoidal currents are applied when the motor has a sinusoidal back EMF, and rectangular currents are applied when the back EMF has a trapezoidal shape. If implemented perfectly, each of these drive schemes is capable of producing ripple-free torque, which is desirable in many applications. However, in reality, permanent magnet motors never exhibit perfectly sinusoidal or trapezoidal back EMFs. Moreover, the power electronics used to drive the motor often has limitations that keep it from producing the required current waveform, especially as speed or load torque increases. In addition to these limitations, a permanent magnet motor often exhibits parasitic cogging torque that directly contributes to torque ripple. This work explores the relationships between motor current and back EMF, and identifies minimum torque ripple, maximum efficiency current excitations that can be implemented with finite bandwidth power electronics (current controlled VSI).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.293899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7263/00293899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.293899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263","startPage":"292","endPage":"300","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293899.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum torque ripple, maximum efficiency excitation of brushless permanent magnet motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimum torque ripple, maximum efficiency excitation of brushless permanent magnet motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4727121","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum torque ripple, maximum efficiency excitation of brushless permanent magnet motors","sourcePdf":"00293899.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028242S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"182","articleId":"293899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":293901,"authors":[{"name":"Ghang-Ming Liaw","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ghang-Ming Liaw","id":"37088010241"},{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37086996997"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"293901","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Induction motor drives","Uncertainty","Control systems","Pulse width modulation inverters","Robust stability","Induction motors","Torque control","Inductance","Pi control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","variable speed drives","velocity control","digital control","microcomputer applications","two-term control","machine control","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust speed controller","induction motor drives","parameter variations","external disturbance","indirect field-oriented control","microprocessor","dynamic model","PI controller","quantitatively design","tracking","dead-time compensator","performance","load regulating performance"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust speed controller for induction motor drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293901","doi":"10.1109/41.293901","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293901.png","startPage":"308","endPage":"315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/7263/00293901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.293901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263","abstract":"A speed controller considering the effects of parameter variations and external disturbance for indirect field-oriented induction motor drives is proposed in this paper.

The simulated detector system had 600 bismuth germanate crystals of 3.14 mm width and 30 mm length packed on a single ring of 60 cm diameter. The space between crystals was filled up with lead (i.e., septa). Each crystal was in coincidence with 200 opposite crystals so that the FOV had a radius of 30 cm. The detector response was modeled based on the attenuating properties of the crystals and the septa, as well as the geometry of the detector system. The modeled detector-response function was used to restore the projections from the sinogram of the ring-detector system. The restored projections had a uniform sampling of 1.57 mm across the FOV. The crystal penetration and/or the nonuniform sampling were compensated in the projections. A penalized maximum-likelihood algorithm was employed to accomplish the restoration. The restored projections were then filtered and backprojected to reconstruct the image. A chest phantom with a few small circular \"cold\" objects (/spl ap/4 mm diameter) located at the center and near the periphery of FOV was computer generated and used to test the restoration. The reconstructed images from the restored projections demonstrated resolution improvement off the FOV center, while preserving the resolution near the center.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293924/","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4737141","pubMedId":"18218507","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","displayDocTitle":"Detector response restoration in image reconstruction of high resolution positron emission tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detector response restoration in image reconstruction of high resolution positron emission tomography","sourcePdf":"00293924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043076S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"53","articleId":"293924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":293966,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.J.

We have demonstrated highly efficient EDFA's incorporating optimized 664- and 827-nm pump wavelengths and an Er-doped high numerical aperture (NA) fiber with thermally diffused expanded core (TEC) fiber ends. Gain coefficients of 3.8 and 1.3 dB/mW at respective wavelengths of 664 and 827 nm were achieved at a signal wavelength of 1535 nm. Noise figures of 3.1 and 4.1 dB at respective pump wavelengths of 670 and 827 nm were obtained at a signal wavelength of 1535 nm. A highly efficient Er-doped fiber amplifier module, in which an AlGaInP visible laser diode (LD) was used as the pump source, was successfully developed as a practical application of this technology. A maximum overall gain coefficient of 3.0 dB/mW was achieved at a signal wavelength of 1535 nm. The EDFA module realized a maximum overall signal gain of 33 dB at 1535 nm with a saturated output power of -1 dBm. A maximum saturated output power of 3.9 dBm was obtained at a signal wavelength of 1552 nm.

For this reason, one might expect that the amount of cross-phase modulation would increase with increasing channel number, causing increased interference among channels and hence limiting the total number of channels that a WDM system can support. However, computer simulations of multichannel systems have shown no change in signal distortion as the number of wavelength channels is increased from four to eight. In a simulated three-channel system, the signal distortion of the central channel approaches that of a single-channel system as the wavelength separation is increased to approximately 2 nm. Thus, even a moderate amount of dispersion tends to cancel out the influence of cross-phase modulation, so that beyond a certain wavelength spacing, additional channels do not interfere with the channel under consideration. From these observations, we conclude that cross-phase modulation does not limit the number of wavelength channels that a single optical fiber can support. However, self- and cross-phase modulation are not the only nonlinear effects influencing fiber lightwave systems. Stimulated Raman scattering tends to transfer optical power from short-wavelength channels to channels operating at longer wavelength, degrading their signal-to-noise ratio. The efficiency of this process increases with increasing wavelength spacing. Clearly, a compromise needs to be reached between the conflicting requirements imposed by the optical Kerr effect and by stimulated Raman scattering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.293982","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7266/00293982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.293982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266","startPage":"885","endPage":"890","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00293982.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependence of cross-phase modulation on channel number in fiber WDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=293982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dependence of cross-phase modulation on channel number in fiber WDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/293982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4732886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependence of cross-phase modulation on channel number in fiber WDM systems","sourcePdf":"00293982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039066S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"106","articleId":"293982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294009,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The heart of this method, called ECIS for electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, is a small gold electrode immersed in tissue culture medium. When cells attach and spread on this electrode, the measured electrical impedance changes because the cells constrain the current flow. This changing impedance can be interpreted to reveal useful information about cell behaviors. Since these behaviors, such as spreading and locomotion, involve the coordination of many biochemical reactions, they are extremely sensitive to most external parameters such as temperature, pH, and a myriad of chemical compounds. This broad response to changes in the environment allows this method to serve as a general biosensor. The measurements are easily automated, and the general conditions of the cells can be monitored by a personal computer controlling the necessary instrumentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.294012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","startPage":"402","endPage":"408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/7267/00294012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.294012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A biosensor that monitors cell morphology with electrical fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biosensors","Morphology","Electrodes","Animals","Heart","Gold","Current measurement","Impedance measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Electric variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","biosensors","monitoring","biological techniques and instruments","electric impedance measurement","bioelectric phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell morphology monitoring","whole cell biosensor","electrical fields","animal cell tissue culture","electric cell-substrate impedance sensing","small gold electrode","tissue culture medium","cell behavior","coordinated biochemical reactions","cell spreading","cell locomotion","general biosensor","personal computer controlled instrumentation","Au"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June-July  1994","displayDocTitle":"A biosensor that monitors cell morphology with electrical fields","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4727283","publicationDate":"June-July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June-July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294012/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biosensor that monitors cell morphology with electrical fields","sourcePdf":"00294012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036656S","chronDate":"June-July  1994","isNumber":"7267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"104","articleId":"294012","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294103,"authors":[{"name":"K.N.

The interaction of an ultrasonic plane wave impulse with a single cylindrical scatterer using time and frequency domain approaches is reviewed. Myocardial tissue is modeled as a suspension of aligned cylindrically shaped scatterers uniformly distributed in a homogeneous medium. The authors propose extensions to this model to deal with nonideal scatterer orientation, by introducing axial distribution functions and scatterer size distributions based on histology, modeled as a uniform distribution. The backscatter coefficient in the range 2.0-8.0 MHz is calculated. An algorithm to compute the average differential scattering cross section is presented. Ultrasonic elastic properties of myocardial tissue are discussed. Results of the anisotropy of the numerically computed backscatter parameters for model media having nominal mechanical and acoustic properties of canine myocardial tissue are presented and compared to available experimental data along with discussion of possible conclusions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.294103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/7270/00294103.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.294103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative modeling of the anisotropy of ultrasonic backscatter from canine myocardium","volume":"41","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4738417","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294103/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative modeling of the anisotropy of ultrasonic backscatter from canine myocardium","sourcePdf":"00294103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044393S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"14","articleId":"294103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":294109,"authors":[{"name":"R.Y.

First, forward modeling is performed for a point source and a point receiver. This is then used to model the received data set for each of the imaging categories. Subsequently, the inversion algorithm for each category is derived, and their performance is evaluated in terms of resolution, noise, and computation. We show that in terms of resolution, back-scatter imaging is the best, followed by full-array and common-source imaging. However, in terms of material noise, full-array imaging is the best, with back-scatter and common-source imaging having the same material noise response. Full-array imaging is the only system with inherent redundancy to reduce electronic noise, but at the expense of significantly more computation. The physical transducer is in the full-array category, allowing mechanical scanning to be traded for dynamic focusing and computational power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","volume":"41","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4738423","displayDocTitle":"Analytic evaluation of sampled aperture ultrasonic imaging techniques for NDE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic evaluation of sampled aperture ultrasonic imaging techniques for NDE","sourcePdf":"00294109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034894S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"49","articleId":"294109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":294114,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These predictions are verified by means of extensive simulations, which also provide an insight into the effect of electronic noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4738428","displayDocTitle":"Multifrequency Doppler: improving the quality of spectral estimation by making full use of the information present in the backscattered RF echoes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multifrequency Doppler: improving the quality of spectral estimation by making full use of the information present in the backscattered RF echoes","sourcePdf":"00294114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038043S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"25","articleId":"294114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":294115,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This sounds simple enough, but when the company has hundreds of field personnel covering a large area, and thousands of incoming calls each day, coordinating assignments and scheduling service workers can be a logistical nightmare. When a call comes into a traditional automated field service network, the person taking the call creates a call order in a database application called a service management system, or SMS. The author discusses the 3M Sage Decision Optimizer that works at the back end of an existing system for dispatching field service technicians. The embedded component combines optimization and constrained heuristic search to schedule resources better than in either manual or existing automated methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1994","publicationDate":"April 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4742845","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated assignment and scheduling of service personnel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated assignment and scheduling of service personnel","sourcePdf":"00294133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031009S","chronDate":"April  1994","isNumber":"7271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"3","articleId":"294133","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294135,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This approach is based on a \"backbone curve\" that captures the robot's macroscopic geometric features. The inverse kinematic, or \"hyper-redundancy resolution,\" problem reduces to determining the time varying backbone curve behavior. To efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, the authors introduce a \"modal\" approach, in which a set of intrinsic backbone curve shape functions are restricted to a modal form. The singularities of the modal approach, modal non-degeneracy conditions, and modal switching are considered. For discretely segmented morphologies, the authors introduce \"fitting\" algorithms that determine the actuator displacements that cause the discrete manipulator to adhere to the backbone curve. These techniques are demonstrated with planar and spatial mechanism examples. They have also been implemented on a 30 degree-of-freedom robot prototype.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4728971","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A modal approach to hyper-redundant manipulator kinematics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modal approach to hyper-redundant manipulator kinematics","sourcePdf":"00294209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041038S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"344","articleId":"294209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294213,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Hence, any polarization rotation can be accomplished by a simple mechanical rotation of this low-mass polarizer instead of rotating or modifying the much heavier antenna and its complex feed components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4739144","volume":"4","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Meander-line polarizer for arbitrary rotation of linear polarization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meander-line polarizer for arbitrary rotation of linear polarization","sourcePdf":"00294292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028151S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"33","articleId":"294292","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294335,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A number of inverse kinematics schemes are reviewed which allow robot control through kinematic singularities. The basic scheme adopts a damped least-squares inverse of the manipulator Jacobian with a varying damping factor acting in the neighborhood of singularities. The effect of a weighted damped least-squares solution is investigated to provide user-defined accuracy capabilities along prescribed end-effector space directions. An online estimation algorithm is employed to measure closeness to singular configurations. A feedback correction error term is introduced to ensure algorithm tracking convergence and its effect on the joint velocity solution is discussed. Computational aspects are discussed in view of real-time implementation of the proposed schemes. Experimental case studies are developed to investigate manipulator performance in the case of critical end-effector trajectories passing through and near the shoulder and wrist singularities of the structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4729858","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Review of the damped least-squares inverse kinematics with experiments on an industrial robot manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of the damped least-squares inverse kinematics with experiments on an industrial robot manipulator","sourcePdf":"00294335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04222S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"205","articleId":"294335","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":294341,"authors":[{"name":"A.-U.

In this technique, the spectral variations are separated into two categories, one acoustic and the other phone-specific, where each variation source is modeled by a linear transformation system. The technique consists of two sequential steps: first, acoustic normalization is performed, and second, phone model parameters are adapted. Experiments of speaker adaptation on the TIMIT database using short calibration speech (5 s per speaker) have shown significant performance improvement over the baseline speaker-independent continuous speech recognition, where the recognition system uses Gaussian mixture density based hidden Markov models of phone units. For a vocabulary size of 853 and test set perplexity of 104, the recognition word accuracy has been improved from 86.9% for the baseline system to 90.5% after adaptation, corresponding to an error reduction of 27.5%. On a more difficult test set that contains an additional variation source due to recording channel mismatch, a more significant performance improvement has been obtained: for the same vocabulary and a test set perplexity of 101, the recognition word accuracy has been improved from 65.4% for the baseline to 86.0% after adaptation, corresponding to an error reduction of 59.5%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/7279/00294352.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An acoustic-phonetic-based speaker adaptation technique for improving speaker-independent continuous speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/89.294352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.294352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=294352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"An acoustic-phonetic-based speaker adaptation technique for improving speaker-independent continuous speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4725078","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An acoustic-phonetic-based speaker adaptation technique for improving speaker-independent continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00294352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032694S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"37","articleId":"294352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294362,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It also presents detailed case studies of leading environments. Following Holland's (1975) original genetic algorithm proposal, many variations of the basic algorithm have been introduced. However. an important and distinctive feature of all GAs is the population-handling technique. The original GA adopted a generational replacement policy, according to which the whole population is replaced in each generation. Conversely, the steady-state policy used by many subsequent GAs selectively replaces the population. After we introduce GA models and their programming, we present a survey of GA programming environments. We have grouped them into three major classes according to their objectives: application-oriented systems hide the details of GAs and help users develop applications for specific domains; algorithm-oriented systems are based on specific GA models; and toolkits are flexible environments for programming a range of GAs and applications. We review the available environments and describe their common features and requirements. As case studies, we select some specific systems for more detailed examination.

Both are superscalar implementations, that is, they can sustain execution of two or more instructions per clock cycle. Otherwise, these two implementations present vastly different philosophies for achieving high performance. The PowerPC 601 focuses on powerful instructions and great flexibility in processing order, while the Alpha 21064 depends on a very fast clock, with simpler instructions and a more streamlined implementation structure. These two RISC microprocessors exemplify contrasting, but equally valid, implementation philosophies. An overview is given of the instruction sets and the authors emphasize the differences in design: PowerPC uses powerful instructions so that fewer are needed to get the job done; Alpha uses simple instructions so that the hardware can be kept simpler and faster. The authors also discuss the pipelined implementations of the two architectures; again, the contrast is between powerful and simple.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/294853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4721932","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"PowerPC 601 and Alpha 21064: a tale of two RISCs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PowerPC 601 and Alpha 21064: a tale of two RISCs","sourcePdf":"00294853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117875S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"31","articleId":"294853","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":294857,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We illustrate the application of object-oriented techniques using a load-store, reduced instruction-set processor that contains a local memory. The instruction set consists of 22 instructions, which require one or two 16-bit words. Arithmetic is performed in two's complement.

The authors present some new lossless image compression techniques that capture spectral correlations as well as spatial correlation in a simple and elegant manner. The schemes are based on the notion of a prediction tree, which defines a noncausal prediction model for an image. The authors present a backward adaptive technique and a forward adaptive technique. They then give a computationally efficient way of approximating the backward adaptive technique. The approximation gives good results and is extremely easy to compute. Simulation results show that for high spectral resolution images, significant savings can be made by using spectral correlations in addition to spatial correlations. Furthermore, the increase in complexity incurred in order to make these gains is minimal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.295043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7287/00295043.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.295043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless compression of multispectral image data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295043/","displayDocTitle":"Lossless compression of multispectral image data","volume":"32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4752365","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless compression of multispectral image data","sourcePdf":"00295043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043875S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"52","articleId":"295043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":295052,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By examining the dependence of backscattering on standing biomass using backscatter modeling and aircraft data, it was determined, in agreement with other recent reports, that the cross-polarized (HV) data from longer wavelengths (L, P-band) were the best radar channels for mapping total above-ground forest biomass. The radar signal appeared to lose sensitivity to changes in biomass for dry biomass levels beyond about 15 kg/m/sup 2/ (150 Mton/Ha).

While backscatter measurements were also made over land, they have been primarily used for the calibration of the instrument. This has been due in part to the low resolution of the scatterometer measurements (nominally 50 km). In a separate paper the present authors introduced a new method for generating enhanced resolution radar measurements of the Earth's surface using spaceborne scatterometry. In the present paper, the method is used with SASS data to study vegetation classification over the extended Amazon basin using the resulting medium-scale radar images. The remarkable correlation between the Ku-band radar images and vegetation formations is explored, and the results of several successful experiments to classify the general vegetation classes using the image data are presented. The results demonstrate the utility of medium-scale radar imagery in the study of tropical vegetation and permit utilization of both historic and contemporary scatterometer data for studies of global change. Because the scatterometer provides frequent, wide-area coverage at a variety of incidence angles, it can supplement higher resolution instruments which often have narrow swaths with limited coverage and incidence angle diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.295059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287","startPage":"449","endPage":"460","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7287/00295059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.295059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vegetation studies of the Amazon basin using enhanced resolution Seasat scatterometer data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spaceborne radar","Radar measurements","Vegetation mapping","Sea measurements","Radar imaging","Sea surface","Radar scattering","Backscatter","Instruments","Oceans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forestry","remote sensing by radar","geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface","radar remote sensing","vegetation forest","Brazil","Amazon basin","enhanced resolution Seasat scatterometer","Seasat-A","SASS","image classification","Ku-band","SHF microwave","medium-scale radar imagery","tropical vegetation","geophysical measurement technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Vegetation studies of the Amazon basin using enhanced resolution Seasat scatterometer data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4752377","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vegetation studies of the Amazon basin using enhanced resolution Seasat scatterometer data","sourcePdf":"00295059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056855S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","articleId":"295059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":295060,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

One inversion procedure, referred to as the Fourier transform method, employs the spatial Fourier transform of measured data and requires subsurface inhomogeneities to be relatively deep. The second inversion method does not require the data to be Fourier transformed; however, it does require the additional restriction that inhomogeneities be relatively small. This is referred to as the far-field method. These two inversion relationships are used to reconstruct images of both spatial variations-in refractive index and log likelihood function. It is found that both procedures perform well at a site where only a single isolated inhomogeneity exists. At a second site, where there are two adjacent inhomogeneities, the Fourier transform method proved superior.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.295060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"461","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7287/00295060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.295060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ground penetrating radar tomography: algorithms and case studies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Tomography","Computer aided software engineering","Geophysical measurements","Signal processing algorithms","Pollution measurement","Object detection","Fourier transforms","Refractive index","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical prospecting","geophysical techniques","terrestrial electricity","inverse problems","radar applications","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical prospecting","measurement technique","geoelectric","terrestrial electricity","ground penetrating radar tomography","EM method","algorithm","inversion","inverse problem","imaging","target detection","buried object detection","Fourier transform method","spatial Fourier transform","subsurface inhomogeneities","far-field method","log likelihood function","shallow crust structure geology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Ground penetrating radar tomography: algorithms and case studies","volume":"32","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4752378","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295060/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ground penetrating radar tomography: algorithms and case studies","sourcePdf":"00295060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044142S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"67","articleId":"295060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295130,"authors":[{"name":"B.

When process delays have known causes, they can be mitigated by acquiring causal rules from human experts and then applying sensors and automated real-time diagnostic devices to the process. However, for some delays the experts have only weak causal knowledge or none at all. In such cases, machine learning tools can collect training data and process it through an induction engine in search of diagnostic knowledge. We have applied a machine learning strategy known as decision tree induction to derive a set of rules about a long-standing problem in rotogravure printing. The induction mechanism is embedded within a knowledge acquisition system that suggests plausible rules to an expert, who can override the rules or modify the data from which the rules were derived. By using decision tree induction to derive process control rules, this system lets experts participate in knowledge acquisition by doing what they do best: exercising their expertise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Expert","pdfPath":"/iel3/64/7291/00295130.pdf","doi":"10.1109/64.295130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/64.295130","startPage":"60","endPage":"66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming process delays with decision tree induction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295130/","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming process delays with decision tree induction","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4684949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming process delays with decision tree induction","sourcePdf":"00295130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043788S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"25","articleId":"295130","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295132,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

However, these problems can be circumvented by embedding the speech recognition technology within a dialog processing mechanism. Such a variable initiative dialog is a major advance that lets natural-language systems communicate effectively with novices and experts. Based on a theory of natural-language dialog that addresses these issues, the author has implemented a system that uses spoken natural language to help users repair electronic circuits. The integrated dialog-processing model combines a domain problem solver, a general subdialog mechanism, and knowledge about the user to provide timely and coherent assistance to the user. The robust parsing and language-understanding mechanism helps the system to correctly determine the meaning of utterances in spite of misrecognitions. Results indicate that commercial application of this technology is within reach, and should stimulate thought about how to further improve the quality of spoken natural-language interaction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295132/","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4684947","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spoken variable initiative dialog: an adaptable natural-language interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoken variable initiative dialog: an adaptable natural-language interface","sourcePdf":"00295132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028358S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"7291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"64","citationCount":"2","articleId":"295132","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295133,"authors":[{"name":"Minhwa Chung","affiliation":["Korea Telecom Research Center, South Korea"],"lastName":"Minhwa Chung","id":"37383144700"},{"name":"D.

A unique feature of the modularized MVDR (M/sup 2/VDR) beamformer is the ability to distribute adaptive degrees of freedom (DOF) among beamformer stages. This property of the M/sup 2/VDR beamformer allows DOF to be adapted over different time scales. As a consequence of the multiple stage decomposition adaptive beamformer weights appear in a form which suggest an apparent increase in the number of DOF. To properly analyze this ease an alternative interpretation of adaptive DOF is introduced to establish the equivalence between the MVDR beamformer and its cascaded realization. In the second part of this paper the distribution for the output power estimate of a P stage M/sup 2/VDR beamformer is derived. Analysis reveals the necessity of placing constraints on the adaptation time assigned to each beamformer stage. Simulation experiments are presented that demonstrate the applicability of the M/sup 2/VDR beamformer in resolving closely spaced sources under impulsive interference conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.295189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7292","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7292/00295189.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiple time scale modularized adaptive beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A multiple time scale modularized adaptive beamformer","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719550","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiple time scale modularized adaptive beamformer","sourcePdf":"00295189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031309S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","articleId":"295189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":295194,"authors":[{"name":"P.

All the synaptic weights of the model are trained with the normalized Hebbian learning rule. The network structure features a hierarchical set of lateral connections among the output units which serve the purpose of weight orthogonalization. This structure also allows the size of the model to grow or shrink without need for retraining the old units. The exponential convergence of the network is formally proved while there is significant performance improvement over previous methods. By establishing an important connection with the recursive least squares algorithm they have been able to provide the optimal size for the learning step-size parameter which leads to a significant improvement in the convergence speed. This is in contrast with previous neural PCA models which lack such numerical advantages. The APEX algorithm is also parallelizable allowing the concurrent extraction of multiple principal components. Furthermore, APEX is shown to be applicable to the constrained PCA problem where the signal variance is maximized under external orthogonality constraints. They then study various principal component analysis (PCA) applications that might benefit from the adaptive solution offered by APEX. In particular they discuss applications in spectral estimation, signal detection and image compression and filtering, while other application domains are also briefly outlined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.295198","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7292/00295198.pdf","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.295198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Principal component EXtraction (APEX) and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Principal component EXtraction (APEX) and applications","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4719541","publicationDate":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Principal component EXtraction (APEX) and applications","sourcePdf":"00295198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040096S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"127","articleId":"295198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":295200,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

To achieve additional speedup in these structures requires the use of parallel processing techniques such as pipelining and block processing. Pipelining is well understood but few block architectures have been developed for rank order and stack filtering. Block processing is essential for additional speedup when the original architecture has reached the throughput limits caused by the underlying technology. A trivial block structure simply repeats a single input, single output structure to generate a multiple input, multiple output structure. Therefore the architecture can achieve speedups equal to the number of multiple outputs or the block size. However, unlike linear filters, the rank order and stack filter outputs are calculated using comparisons. It is possible to share these comparisons within the block structure and thus substantially reduce the size of the block structure. The authors introduce a systematic method for applying block processing to rank order filters and stack filters. This method takes advantage of shared comparisons within the block structure to generate a block filter with shared substructures whose complexity is reduced by up to one-third compared to the original filter structure times the block size. Furthermore, block processing is important for the generation of low power designs. A block structure can trade its increased speedup for a throughput equal to the original single output architecture but with a significantly lower power requirement. The power reduction in the trivial block structures is limited by the power supply voltage.

It is shown that the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of the time-frequency (t-f) kernels allows the expression of the time-frequency distributions in terms of weighted sum of smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distributions or modified periodograms, which are the two basic nonparametric power distributions for stationary and nonstationary signals, respectively. The windows appearing in the decomposition take zero and/or negative values and, therefore, are different than the time and lag windows commonly employed by these two distributions. The centrosymmetry and the time-support properties of the kernels along with the fast decay of the singular values lead to computational savings and allow for an efficient reduced rank kernel approximations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.295203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7292","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7292/00295203.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral decomposition of time-frequency distribution kernels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectral decomposition of time-frequency distribution kernels","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719536","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral decomposition of time-frequency distribution kernels","sourcePdf":"00295203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058822S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","articleId":"295203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":295205,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

The targets are assumed to be moving with constant accelerations subject to minor random perturbations and emitting narrow band signals that impinge on an array of passive sensors. Estimates of the DOA vector of the targets are obtained from the sensor data based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle in such a way that the association between the estimates made at different time points is maintained. At each stage, the current ML estimates of DOA are treated as measurements and refined via a Kalman filter; tracking is accomplished without the need to perform unduly heavy computations. An efficient strategy for dealing with closely spaced targets is also presented.

The operation of symmetric convolution is a formalized approach to convolving symmetrically extended sequences. The result is the same as that obtained by taking an inverse discrete trigonometric transform (DTT) of the product of the forward DTTs of those two sequences. There are 16 members in the family of DTTs. Each provides a representation for a corresponding distinct type of symmetric-periodic sequence. The author defines symmetric convolution, relates the DSTs and DCTs to symmetric-periodic sequences, and then use these principles to develop simple but powerful convolution-multiplication properties for the entire family of DSTs and DCTs. Symmetric convolution can be used for discrete linear filtering when the filter is symmetric or antisymmetric. The filtering will be efficient because fast algorithms exist for all versions of the DTTs. Conventional linear convolution is possible if one first zero-pad the input data. Symmetric convolution and its fast implementation using DTTs are now an alternative to circular convolution and the DFT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.295213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7292/00295213.pdf","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.295213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295213/","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4719526","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric convolution and the discrete sine and cosine transforms","sourcePdf":"00295213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089457S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"246","articleId":"295213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295215,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The coefficients of the PTV-SS system are restricted to a few power-of-two values. Therefore, such a structure can be implemented using shift and accumulate operations. In this paper, nonsystolic as well as systolic architectures for VLSI implementations of the PTV-SS system are developed.

The thresholds divide the domain of SNR values into several disjoint segments. For very low SNR values the observations are dominated by noise and are essentially useless for delay estimation. Here the MSE is determined largely by the available a priori information. For intermediate SNR values, time delay estimates are possible, but are subject to ambiguities resulting from the oscillatory nature of the signal sample correlation. For very high SNR values, these ambiguities are resolvable and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) yields a realistic bound for the attainable performance. A previous paper by Zeira and Schultheiss (see IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, vol.41, p.3102-3113, Nov. 1993) used the Barankin (1949) bound to obtain a realizable lower bound for the intermediate SNR region but left open the question where the transitions from low to medium and medium to high SNR operation occur. Since the attainable MSE in the three regions can be very different, the location of the SNR thresholds is of considerable practical interest. The present paper addresses this issue. It obtains threshold values for the single and two echo problems, with emphasis on the effect of echo separation in the two echo case. It concludes that the location of the thresholds is only weakly dependent on echo separation, even though the attainable MSE in both the intermediate and high SNR regions varies drastically as the echo separation changes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4719522","displayDocTitle":"Realizable lower bounds for time delay estimation. 2.

Our purpose in this article is to present yet another approach, for the sake of achieving two important goals. The first one is to show how several different variants of the recursive least-squares algorithm can be directly related to the widely studied Kalman filtering problem of estimation and control. Our second important goal is to present all the different versions of the RLS algorithm in computationally convenient square-root forms: a prearray of numbers has to be triangularized by a rotation, or a sequence of elementary rotations, in order to yield a postarray of numbers. The quantities needed to form the next prearray can then be read off from the entries of the postarray, and the procedure can be repeated; the explicit forms of the rotation matrices are not needed in most cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/79/7293/00295229.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/79.295229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.295229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A state-space approach to adaptive RLS filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance light scattering","Adaptive filters","Signal processing algorithms","Information filters","Information filtering","State estimation","Riccati equations","Recursive estimation","Kalman filters","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering and prediction theory","signal processing","estimation theory","least squares approximations","state-space methods","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-space method","adaptive RLS filtering","adaptive filtering algorithms","recursive least squares","RLS","inverse QR-least squares","QR-least squares","QR decomposition-based least squares lattice","gradient-based algorithms","least-mean square","LMS","Kalman filtering","square-root algorithms","rotations","prearray","postarray","rotation matrices","array algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"A state-space approach to adaptive RLS filtering","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4743592","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A state-space approach to adaptive RLS filtering","sourcePdf":"00295229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076051S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"307","articleId":"295229","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295239,"authors":[{"name":"M.

When a limit cycle loses its stability, the attractor changes directly to chaos (instant chaos) without undergoing a period doubling bifurcation or an intermittency. The width of the attractor's band is continuous at the bifurcation point, and the chaotic band grows larger continuously as the system parameter is varied. We call this bifurcation a singular bifurcation into instant chaos. The purpose of this paper is to show that the singular phenomenon arises from the piecewise-linearity of the system. To analyze this phenomenon in detail, the degenerate approach is applied. In this simplified case, the Poincare map is derived rigorously as a one-dimensional mapping. By analyzing it, we prove with computer assistance that the Liapunov exponent jumps discontinuously from minus to plus at the bifurcation point.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.295239","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7294/00295239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.295239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","startPage":"433","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A singular bifurcation into instant chaos in a piecewise-linear circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A singular bifurcation into instant chaos in a piecewise-linear circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295239/","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4739222","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A singular bifurcation into instant chaos in a piecewise-linear circuit","sourcePdf":"00295239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024394S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"24","articleId":"295239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":295240,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper presents a modified EEPROM device with two tunneling injectors that allows bidirectional, accurately controlled programming with voltages in the range of normal supply voltages. Additionally, two static voltages are required. This scheme allows full integration of the programming circuitry on chip. Applications in the areas of offset reduction for OPAMPs in clocked and continuous time systems as well as in neural network learning are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.295240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.295240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294","startPage":"443","endPage":"452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7294/00295240.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Low voltage","MOSFETs","EPROM","Circuits","Breakdown voltage","Tunneling","Clocks","Continuous time systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLD programming","MOS integrated circuits","EPROM","integrated memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control voltage","programming","floating gate MOSFETs","EEPROM devices","bulk-drain breakdown voltages","programming circuitry","tunneling injectors","static voltages","offset reduction","continuous time systems","clocked systems","neural network learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low control voltage programming of floating gate MOSFETs and applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4739223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295240/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low control voltage programming of floating gate MOSFETs and applications","sourcePdf":"00295240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022344S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"15","articleId":"295240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":295247,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Although the need for wireless access to a network is evident, new problems are inherent in the wireless medium itself. Specifically, the wireless medium introduces new opportunities for eavesdropping on wireless data communications. Anyone with an appropriate wireless receiver can eavesdrop, and this kind of eavesdropping is virtually undetectable. Furthermore, since the wireless medium cannot be contained by the usual physical constraints of walls and doors, active intrusions through the wireless medium are also made easier. In order to prevent this unauthorized access to the network, the authors present the design of a secure communication protocol that provides for both the privacy of wireless data communications and the authenticity of communicating parties. The placement of the protocol in the overall protocol stack and issues relevant to wireless links and mobile computing devices are discussed. They also present proof of the security of the protocol using the logic of authentication formalism developed by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham (1990).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"1st Qtr.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"1st Qtr.  1994","publicationDate":"1st Qtr. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4637469","volume":"1","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy and authentication for wireless local area networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy and authentication for wireless local area networks","sourcePdf":"00295357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027691S","chronDate":"1st Qtr.  1994","isNumber":"7300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"111","articleId":"295357","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295359,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To realize this, it is necessary to locate users who move from place to place. The strategies commonly proposed are two-level hierarchical strategies, which maintain a system of home and visited databases/spl mdash/home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR)/spl mdash/to keep track of user locations. Two standards exist for carrying out two-level hierarchical strategies using HLRs and VLRs. The standard commonly used in North America is the Electronics Industry Association/Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA) Interim Standard 41 (IS-41), and in Europe the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The authors introduce these two strategies for locating users and provide a tutorial on their usage. Different forms of mobility in the context of PCS and a reference model for a PCS architecture are discussed. The user location strategies specified in the IS-41 and GSM standards are described, and then, using a simple example, a simplified analysis of the database loads generated by each strategy is presented. Also briefly discussed are possible modifications to these protocols that are likely to result in significant benefits by reducing query and update rate to databases and/or reducing the signaling traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/98.295359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/98/7300/00295359.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.295359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two user location strategies for personal communications services","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"1st Qtr.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"1st Qtr.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Two user location strategies for personal communications services","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1st Qtr. 1994","accessionNumber":"4637470","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two user location strategies for personal communications services","sourcePdf":"00295359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026668S","chronDate":"1st Qtr.  1994","isNumber":"7300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"172","articleId":"295359","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295373,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Traditional computer science, physical science, and engineering programs have not cross-trained their students beyond the college sophomore level. The education that occurs beyond this level tends to be ad hoc, on the job, and self-taught. CSE programs have risen out of a desire to remedy this situation. Although program specifics vary, the common thread is that they contain substantial computer science and engineering/science content. All the programs encompass more than one department, and most involve computer science. Ideally, students should learn most of the course material from two disciplines; since this is unreasonable, hard choices must be made as to what material to include. The descriptions presented illustrate the programs' diversity as well as their common approach, combining computer science, engineering, science, and applied mathematics in some way.

It includes the two's complement representation and the signed-digit representation as special cases. The hybrid number representations proposed are capable of bounding the maximum length of carry propagation chains during addition to any desired value between 1 and the entire word length. The framework reveals a continuum of number representations between the two extremes of two's complement and signed-digit number systems and allows a unified performance analysis of the entire spectrum of implementations of adders, multipliers and alike. We present several static CMOS implementations of a two-operand adder which employ the proposed representations. We then derive quantitative estimates of area (in terms of the required number of transistors) and the maximum carry propagation delay for such an adder. The analysis clearly illustrates the trade-offs between area and execution time associated with each of the possible representations. We also discuss adder trees for parallel multipliers and show that the proposed representations lead to compact adder trees with fast execution times. In practice, the area available to a designer is often limited. In such cases, the designer can select the particular hybrid representation that yields the most suitable implementation (fastest, lowest power consumption, etc.) while satisfying the area constraint. Similarly, if the worst case delay is predetermined, the designer can select a hybrid representation that minimizes area or power under the delay constraint.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Arithmetic","Performance analysis","Energy consumption","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital arithmetic","multiplying circuits","carry logic","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid signed-digit number systems","redundant number representations","bounded carry propagation chains","2s complement representation","signed-digit representation","carry propagation chains","performance analysis","CMOS","execution time","parallel multipliers","adder trees","bounded carry propagation","carry-free addition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295850","doi":"10.1109/12.295850","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7318/00295850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.295850","startPage":"880","endPage":"891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid signed-digit number systems: a unified framework for redundant number representations with bounded carry propagation chains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid signed-digit number systems: a unified framework for redundant number representations with bounded carry propagation chains","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4752238","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid signed-digit number systems: a unified framework for redundant number representations with bounded carry propagation chains","sourcePdf":"00295850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02217S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"42","articleId":"295850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":295851,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is also shown how the multiplier, with some simple back-end connections, can compute modular inverses and perform modular division for a power of two as modulus.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.295851","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/7318/00295851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.295851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"892","endPage":"898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A systolic, linear-array multiplier for a class of right-shift algorithms","volume":"43","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4756168","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systolic, linear-array multiplier for a class of right-shift algorithms","sourcePdf":"00295851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040026S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"51","articleId":"295851","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":295853,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Ercegovac","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Ercegovac","id":"37281778200"},{"name":"T.

This paper presents a two-sided unitary transformation structured to facilitate the integrated evaluation of parameters and application of the typically required transformations using only the primitives afforded by CORDIC; thus enabling significant speedup in the computation of these transformations on special-purpose processor array architectures implementing Jacobi-like algorithms. We discuss implementation in (nonredundant) CORDIC to motivate and lead up to implementation in the redundant and on-line enhancements to CORDIC. Both variable and constant scale factor redundant (CFR) CORDIC approaches are detailed and it is shown that the transformations may be computed in 10n+/spl delta/ time, where n is the data precision in bits and /spl delta/ is a constant accounting for accumulated on-line delays. A more area-intensive approach using a novel on-line CORDIC encoded angle summation/difference scheme reduces computation time to 6n+/spl delta/.

To reduce the number of terms in the approximation, the input interval is partitioned into subintervals of equal size, and different coefficients are used for each subinterval. The coefficients used in the approximation are initially determined based on the Chebyshev series approximation. They are then adjusted to obtain exactly rounded results for all inputs. Hardware designs are presented, and delay and area comparisons are made based on the degree of the approximating polynomial and the accuracy of the final result. For single-precision floating point numbers, a design that produces exactly rounded results for all four functions has an estimated delay of 80 ns and a total chip area of 98 mm/sup 2/ in a 1.0-micron CMOS technology.

The use of an interleaved memory reduces storage requirements by allowing each stored function value to be used in interpolation across several segments. This strategy can be shown to always use fewer words of memory than an optimized polynomial with stored polynomial coefficients. Interleaved memory function interpolators are then applied to the specific goal of an accurate logarithmic number system arithmetic unit. Many accuracy requirements for the LNS arithmetic unit are possible. Although a round to nearest would be desirable, it cannot be easily achieved. The goal suggested is to insure that the worst case LNS relative error is smaller than the worst case floating point (FP) relative error. Using the interleaved memory interpolator, the detailed design of an LNS arithmetic unit is performed using a second order polynomial interpolator including approximately 91K bits of ROM.

Existing solutions to the problem are few, and they either involve manual, painstaking scans of the source code using tools based on regular expressions, or the use of large, integrated software engineering environments that include simple pattern-based query processors in their toolkits. We present a framework in which pattern languages are used to specify interesting code features. The pattern languages are derived by extending the source programming language with pattern-matching symbols. We describe SCRUPLE, a finite state machine-based source code search tool, that efficiently implements this framework.

This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field's understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989), the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge (1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.295895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.295895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/7320/00295895.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A metrics suite for object oriented design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"A metrics suite for object oriented design","volume":"20","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4722485","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A metrics suite for object oriented design","sourcePdf":"00295895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055264S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"2863","articleId":"295895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":295910,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In order to find the performance of the network over all possible input ranges, a probabilistic input model is defined. The expected error of the output over this input range is taken as a measure of generalization ability. Two essential elements for carrying out the proposed evaluation technique are estimation of the input probability density and numerical integration. A nonparametric method, which depends on the nearest M neighbors, is used to locally estimate the distribution around each training pattern. An orthogonalization procedure is utilized to determine the covariance matrices of local densities. A Monte Carlo method is used to perform the numerical integration. The proposed evaluation technique has been used to investigate the generalization ability of back propagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers for three test problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.295911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7321/00295911.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.295911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the generalization ability of neural network classifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=295911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295911/","displayDocTitle":"On the generalization ability of neural network classifiers","volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4722524","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the generalization ability of neural network classifiers","sourcePdf":"00295911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042517S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"46","articleId":"295911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":295912,"authors":[{"name":"I.S.I.

A robust noise-independent algorithm is developed that yields skeletons that reflect the structural relationships of the character components. The character skeleton is converted to a tree structure suitable for recognition. A set of fuzzy constrained character graph models (FCCGM's), which tolerate large variability in writing, is designed. These models are graphs, with fuzzily labeled arcs used as prototypes for the characters. A set of rules is applied in sequence to match a character tree to an FCCGM. Arabic handwritings of four writers were used in the learning and testing stages.

To address these challenges, future wireless modems will rely on performance enhancing techniques such as adaptive antennas, DSP-based interference rejection techniques, and real-time signal processing for capacity improvement. The authors present an overview of key simulation issues for wireless communications systems. First, the burst error characteristics of the mobile channel require the selection of appropriate performance measures. Second, accurate simulations require realistic channel models that include the effects of attenuation, multipath propagation, noise, and interference. Third, link-level simulation of wireless systems requires attention to details of system implementation including the effects of nonlinearities.

This decoupling of speed and flux was exploited to simultaneously track the position/speed reference and an optimal flux reference.

These disturbances are characterized by a large number of resonances over a wide-band frequency spectrum. The payloads inside the launch vehicle must be designed strong enough to withstand these structural vibrations. Passive isolators are used to isolate the payloads from the vibrating structure but this type of isolation has no effect on the acoustic excitations. This study focuses on methods for achieving active damping on plate structures by means of piezoelectric actuators (PZTs). An experiment was conducted using PZT actuators and accelerometers mounted on a rectangular plate with an active damping controller implemented on a 486 computer. Two control design methods were evaluated for this application: the H/sub /spl infin method and rate feedback.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.295968","startPage":"34","endPage":"41","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/7323/00295968.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.295968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlling plate vibrations using piezoelectric actuators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibration control","Piezoelectric actuators","Vehicles","Payloads","Damping","Resonance","Wideband","Frequency","Isolators","Accelerometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","space vehicles","vibration control","piezoelectric actuators","piezoelectric devices","large-scale systems","distributed parameter systems","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["plate vibration control","piezoelectric actuators","launch vehicles","intense acoustic fields","mechanically transmitted disturbances","wide-band frequency spectrum","structural vibrations","passive isolators","acoustic excitations","accelerometers","rectangular plate","486 computer","control design methods","H/sub /spl infin method","rate feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/295968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Controlling plate vibrations using piezoelectric actuators","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4751372","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling plate vibrations using piezoelectric actuators","sourcePdf":"00295968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041491S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"42","articleId":"295968","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":296153,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The model accounts for the longitudinal carrier, photon, and refractive index distribution. Furthermore, the model handles both active and passive sections that may include gratings. Thus, simulations of components containing, e.g., gain sections, absorptive sections, phase sections, and gratings, placed arbitrarily along the longitudinal direction of the cavity, are possible. Here, the model has been used for studying the DBR laser as a wavelength converter. Particularly, to improve the performance of the DBT converter, the influence of system and device parameters will be discussed. Calculations show that ultrafast wavelength conversion with rise and fall times less than 50 ps can be obtained. Also, a regenerative effect simultaneous with the wavelength conversion is expected, e.g., improvements in the extinction ratio of the signal of more than 6 dB is predicted for correct design and operation of the component.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.296182","startPage":"943","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7326/00296182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.296182","endPage":"951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling the DBR laser used as wavelength conversion device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the DBR laser used as wavelength conversion device","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4755956","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the DBR laser used as wavelength conversion device","sourcePdf":"00296182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043901S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"296182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":296184,"authors":[{"name":"B.

With the advent of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), however, the first advantage seems to have become less attractive. Nevertheless, the combination of the EDFA and coherent techniques offers a number of attractive features. In this paper, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the excess beat noises (common-mode and image-band beat noises) from optical amplifiers can be suppressed by using coherent receivers such as a balanced receiver and a double-stage phase-diversity (DSPD) receiver. The noise figure (NF) of the excess-noise-suppressed coherent receivers with an optical preamplifier is shown to be 0 dB. Bit-error-rate (BER) formulas are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.296195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.296195","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1035","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7326/00296195.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppression of beat noise from optical amplifiers using coherent receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Suppression of beat noise from optical amplifiers using coherent receivers","publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4755969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296195/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppression of beat noise from optical amplifiers using coherent receivers","sourcePdf":"00296195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034671S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","articleId":"296195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":296197,"authors":[{"name":"H.

code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems with avalanche photodiodes (APD) is analyzed. The bit error rate (BER) can be accurately computed by using the saddlepoint method. The effects of the multiple-user interference (MUI), signal-dependent shot noise, and receiver thermal noise are investigated. Results of the numerical integration illustrate the non-Gaussian property of the receiver output distribution. Exact means and variances are derived for the Gaussian approximation. It is found that when the MUI increases, the saddlepoint approximation yields satisfactory results, but the Gaussian approximation yields higher BER floors. Prime codes and on-off keying (OOK) are considered. Examples illustrate the effects of the system parameters such as the APD gain, threshold, prime code length, and the number of simultaneous users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7326","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/7326/00296201.pdf","doi":"10.1109/50.296201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.296201","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of CDMA optical communication systems with avalanche photodiodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296201/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of CDMA optical communication systems with avalanche photodiodes","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4755975","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of CDMA optical communication systems with avalanche photodiodes","sourcePdf":"00296201.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042476S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","articleId":"296201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":296215,"authors":[{"name":"E.Y.

The specified system requirements on operating range, loss evaluation and harmonic performance led to an SVC configuration which contains one thyristor switched capacitor (TSC) branch, one thyristor controlled reactor (TCR) branch for continuous reactive power control and two double tuned filter branches. The system voltage of the SVC secondary bus was optimized to 8.5 kV based on thyristor equipment capabilities. The paper shows the voltage and current stresses of the thyristor valves taking into account system faults for the TCR branch and misfiring effects on the TSC branch.

The synchronous voltage source is implemented by a multi-pulse inverter using gate turn-off (GTO) thyristors. It is capable of generating internally the reactive power necessary for network compensation, and is also able to interface with an appropriate energy storage device to negotiate real power exchange with the AC system. The paper develops a comprehensive treatment of power flow control using solid-state synchronous voltage sources for shunt compensation, series and phase angle control. It also describes the unique unified power flow controller that is able to control concurrently or selectively all three network parameters (voltage, impedance, transmission angle) determining power transmission. Comparison of the synchronous voltage source approach with the more conventional compensation method of employing thyristor-switched capacitors and reactors shows its superior performance (including the unmatched capability of using both reactive and real power compensation to counteract dynamic disturbances), uniform applicability, smaller physical size, and potentially lower overall cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic compensation of AC transmission lines by solid-state synchronous voltage sources","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.296273","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7328/00296273.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.296273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=296273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296273/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic compensation of AC transmission lines by solid-state synchronous voltage sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4723409","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic compensation of AC transmission lines by solid-state synchronous voltage sources","sourcePdf":"00296273.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037084S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"328","articleId":"296273","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":296277,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Yih Hsu","id":"37087174698"},{"name":"Han-Ching Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Han-Ching Kuo","id":"37087436474"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"296277","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":382},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy reasoning","Power system restoration","Senior members","Fault diagnosis","Fuzzy sets","Electrical fault detection","Samarium","Power & Energy Society","Printing","Load management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system restoration","distribution networks","fuzzy set theory","fault location","power system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution system service restoration","heuristic based fuzzy reasoning","fault location","electricity service","fuzzy set","linguistic variables","multiple-objective problem","Taiwan"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=296277","abstract":"A fuzzy reasoning approach is proposed for the service restoration of a distribution system. After the location of a fault has been identified and the faulted zone has been isolated, it is important for the operators to reach a proper service restoration plan in order to restore the electricity service outside the faulted zone. The operators tend to use their past experience and heuristic rules to devise such a restoration plan because it must satisfy a lot of practical needs and objectives. In addition, the operators' needs and heuristic rules are often expressed in imprecise linguistic terms. In this paper, fuzzy set notation is employed to deal with these imprecise linguistic variables and a set of fuzzy reasoning procedures are developed to implement the operators' heuristic rules. These procedures can be employed to solve the multiple-objective problem of service restoration described in imprecise linguistic variables. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy reasoning approach, service restoration on a distribution system within the service area of Taipei West District Office of Taiwan Power Company is examined. It is found that a proper restoration plan can be reached very efficiently by the proposed approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.296277","startPage":"948","endPage":"953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.296277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/7328/00296277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic based fuzzy reasoning approach for distribution system service restoration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296277/","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic based fuzzy reasoning approach for distribution system service restoration","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4723413","publicationDate":"April 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic based fuzzy reasoning approach for distribution system service restoration","sourcePdf":"00296277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054788S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"101","articleId":"296277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":296281,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is illustrated that by using the voltage correction approach, the iterative process of weakly meshed network voltage calculation is faster and more reliable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296308/","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4723426","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","displayDocTitle":"Voltage correction power flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage correction power flow","sourcePdf":"00296308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025254S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"63","articleId":"296308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":296317,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

Consequently, some tasks may miss their deadlines even if the overall system has the capacity to meet the deadlines of all tasks. An effective load-sharing (LS) scheme is proposed as a solution to this problem. Upon arrival of a task at a node, the node determines whether the node can complete the task in time under the minimum-laxity first-served policy. If the task cannot be guaranteed, or if guarantees of some other tasks are to be violated as a result of the addition of this task to the existing schedule, the node looks up the list of loss-minimizing decisions and determines the best node among a set of nodes in its physical proximity, called its buddy set, to which the task(s) may be transferred. This list of decisions is periodically updated using Bayesian decision analysis and prior/posterior state distributions. These probability distributions are derived from the information collected via time-stamped state-region change broadcasts within each buddy set. By characterizing the inconsistency between a node's \"observed\" state and the corresponding true state with prior and posterior distributions, the node can first estimate the states of other nodes, and then use them to reduce the probability of transferring a task to an \"incapable\") node. Moreover, the use of prior and posterior distributions and Bayesian analysis has made the proposed scheme robust to the variation of design parameters that usually require fine-tuning for adaptive LS. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulation, along with five other schemes: no LS, LS with state probing, LS with random selection, LS with focused addressing, and perfect LS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.296317","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"704","endPage":"719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7329/00296317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.296317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of effective load sharing in distributed real-time systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Bayesian methods","Performance analysis","Robustness","Analytical models","Delay","Pattern analysis","Chaos","Probability distribution","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time systems","multiprocessing systems","resource allocation","delays","Bayes methods","decision theory","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load sharing","distributed real-time systems","minimum-laxity first-served policy","loss-minimizing decisions","buddy set","Bayesian decision analysis","probability distributions","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of effective load sharing in distributed real-time systems","volume":"5","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4724272","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296317/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of effective load sharing in distributed real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00296317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039534S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"36","articleId":"296317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":296323,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Three types of erosion patterns were observed at the different load current regions. First, the distributed craters occurred on the anode and scattered redeposited mounds surrounded by sprayed particles on the cathode when the current was less than about 2.5 A, which we called a critical transition current because it demonstrates the change of metal transfer direction. Second, if the current was larger than the critical current value, pips occurred on the anode and craters on the cathode. Third, when the current was around the critical current value, pips and craters coexisted either on the cathode or on the anode. The behaviors of electrical contact resistance and arc duration in metallic phase and gaseous phase at different load current are reported. The particle sputtering-depositing model is presented and used to explain the mechanism of material transfer process and the formation of erosion patterns. The material transfer direction is affected by an arc duration of metallic phase as well as gaseous phase. The electrical contact resistance not only depends on the surface films and surface morphology, but also is influenced by the particle sputtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296370/","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4712145","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Contact erosion patterns of Pd material in DC breaking arcs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact erosion patterns of Pd material in DC breaking arcs","sourcePdf":"00296370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046574S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"31","articleId":"296370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296372,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result, there is an increasing need to quantify the capabilities of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The goal should be to design a consistent method of monitoring equipment performance that samples the major sources of variation that can impact the process output. This paper discusses a statistical method that utilizes multi vari analysis and the analysis of variance to achieve this goal. The data presented is taken from a commercially available silicon epitaxial reactor and FTIR film measurement tool, but the technique is generic and applicable to other wafer processing operations. The analysis method is presented along with some examples of the application of the calculated standard deviation and process variation. In addition to determining the performance of a piece of equipment over time, this method of analysis can be used to specify and qualify equipment. As an extension of this analysis it is possible to determine the contribution of the measurement system to the observed variability in the process output.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296382/","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4712156","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique with graphical analysis and its application to wafer processing equipment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique with graphical analysis and its application to wafer processing equipment","sourcePdf":"00296382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030902S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"7332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"6","articleId":"296382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296398,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Other modeling techniques, such as first principles or statistical response surface methods, are limited in either efficiency or accuracy. In this study, PECVD modeling using neural networks has been introduced. The deposition of SiO/sub 2/ was characterized via a 2/sup 5-1/ fractional factorial experiment, and data from this experiment was used to train feed-forward neural networks using the error back-propagation algorithm. The optimal neural network structure and learning parameters were determined by means of a second fractional factorial experiment. The optimized networks minimized both learning and prediction error. From these neural process models, the effect of deposition conditions on film properties has been studied, and sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the impact of individual parameter fluctuations. The deposition experiments were carried out in a Plasma Therm 700 series PECVD system. The models obtained will ultimately be used for several other manufacturing applications, including recipe synthesis and process control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4721751","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the properties of PECVD silicon dioxide films using optimized back-propagation neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the properties of PECVD silicon dioxide films using optimized back-propagation neural networks","sourcePdf":"00296398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055887S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"32","articleId":"296398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":296399,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

These models are able to predict the assembly yield with a root mean square (RMS) error of less than 5%. They can be used to predict the assembly yield for new board designs on the same line.

In particular, pH neutralization is notorious for its severe process nonlinearity, which is reflected in the titration curve and shows process gain change of up to 10000 to 1 over a very small region. In this paper, we describe a new technique of in-line control of pH neutralization based on fuzzy logic. The unique features of this fuzzy control technique include 1) a wider operation range for handling a nonlinear process, 2) robustness for dealing with random disturbances and possible system parameter drafting, and 3) relatively simple implementation. Laboratory experiments are performed demonstrating that the controller works well over a wide operational range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4721753","volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"In-line control of nonlinear pH neutralization based on fuzzy logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-line control of nonlinear pH neutralization based on fuzzy logic","sourcePdf":"00296400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045389S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"14","articleId":"296400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296402,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

The reasons for that problem are many. First of all, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the conditions for robust process control. On the other hand, uncertain specification of product quality causes unnecessary inspection, testing, and repair actions. Thus, a strategy for yield improvement requires strong dedication to causal relationships and specification of process and product quality. In the first step, critical process parameters and their causal effects on product quality must be analyzed. In the second step, once critical process parameter are addressed, control strategies can be developed to assure high first pass yields. This paper gives an overview of ongoing work that has been performed to establish a SMT production line with closed loop quality control via direct process monitoring capabilities and integrated inspection operations. For different inspection tasks, 3-D laser and X-ray inspection is applied. Process parameters as well as test and inspection results are gathered on line. Thus, interrelationships between different process steps, beginning from material inspection, solder paste application, components placement, reflow soldering, and final inspection, can be analyzed. Moreover, variation of process parameters conforming to different approaches to design of experiments (DOE) can be performed while running production. On-line diagnosis of process parameters and inspection results enables a closed loop quality control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4721761","volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Closed loop quality control in printed circuit assembly","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed loop quality control in printed circuit assembly","sourcePdf":"00296409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026652S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"14","articleId":"296409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296433,"authors":[{"name":"A.O.

The replicated algorithm stores the entire system's coordinates and forces at each processor, and therefore has a low overhead in maintaining the data distribution. Spatial decompositions distribute the data, providing better locality and scalability with respect to memory and computation. We present EULERGROMOS, a parallelization of the GROMOS molecular dynamics program which is based on a spatial decomposition. EULERGROMOS parallelizes all molecular dynamics phases, with most data structures using O(N/P) memory. The paper focuses on the structure of EULERGROMOS and analyses its performance using molecular systems of current interest in the molecular dynamics community. EULERGROMOS achieves performance increases with as few as twenty atoms per processor. We also compare EULERGROMOS with an earlier parallelization of GROMOS, UHGROMOS, which uses the replicated algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SHPCC.1994.296632","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Scalable High Performance Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Scalable High Performance Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/969/7342/00296632.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SHPCC.1994.296632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelizing molecular dynamics using spatial decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=296632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296632/","displayDocTitle":"Parallelizing molecular dynamics using spatial decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4711237","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelizing molecular dynamics using spatial decomposition","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"00296632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076995S","chronDate":"23-25 May 1994","isNumber":"7342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"969","citationCount":"19","articleId":"296632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296635,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The target architecture is a two-dimensional mesh with worm-hole routing, but the techniques also apply to higher dimensional meshes and hypercubes. We stress a general approach, addressing the need for implementations that perform well for various sized vectors and grid dimensions, including non-power-of-two grids. This requires the development of general techniques for building hybrid algorithms. Finally, the approach also supports collective communication within a group of nodes, which is required by many scalable algorithms.

In a previous paper (G. Lewis et al., 1993), we described the data distribution and communication patterns of several implementations of parallel matrix-vector multiplication, demonstrating that on hypercubes, the cost of communication can be overcome to a much larger extent than is often assumed. In this paper, we generalize the best of those implementations to mesh architectures. We make no assumptions about the mesh being square or power-of-two. We also comment on the implications of our results for structured problems and on the scalability of our approach.

The all-edges and all-DUs (modified all-uses) coverage criteria were applied to 130 faulty program versions derived from seven moderate size base programs by seeding realistic faults. We generated several thousand test sets for each faulty program and examined the relationship between fault detection and coverage. Within the limited domain of our experiments, test sets achieving coverage levels over 90% usually showed significantly better fault detection than randomly chosen test sets of the same size. In addition, significant improvements in the effectiveness of coverage-based tests usually occurred as coverage increased from 90% to 100%. However the results also indicate that 100% code coverage alone is not a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of a test set. We also found that tests based respectively on control-flow and dataflow criteria are frequency complementary in their effectiveness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1994.296778","startPage":"191","endPage":"200","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/981/7343/00296778.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1994.296778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments on the effectiveness of dataflow- and control-flow-based test adequacy criteria","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Software testing","Monitoring","System testing","Costs","Educational institutions","Fault diagnosis","Investments","Control systems","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program testing","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control-flow-based test adequacy criteria","dataflow-based test adequacy criteria","coverage criteria","faulty program versions","test sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Experiments on the effectiveness of dataflow- and control-flow-based test adequacy criteria","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-21 May 1994","accessionNumber":"4711521","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments on the effectiveness of dataflow- and control-flow-based test adequacy criteria","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"00296778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058086S","chronDate":"16-21 May 1994","isNumber":"7343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"981","citationCount":"320","articleId":"296778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":296780,"authors":[{"name":"Yih-Farn Chen","affiliation":["Software Engineering Research Department, AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Yih-Farn Chen","id":"37351433600"},{"name":"D.S.

TESTTUBE first identifies which functions, types, variables and macros are covered by each test unit in a test suite. Each time the system under test is modified, TESTTUBE identifies which entities were changed to create the new version. Using the coverage and change information, TESTTUBE selects only those test units that cover the changed entities for testing the new version. We have applied TESTTUBE to selective retesting of two software systems, an I/O library and a source code analyzer. Additionally, we are adapting TESTTUBE for selective retesting of nondeterministic systems, where the main drawback is the unsuitability of dynamic analysis for identification of covered entities. Our experience with TESTTUBE has been quite encouraging, with an observed reduction of 50% or more in the number of test cases needed to test typical software changes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1994.296780","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/981/7343/00296780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1994.296780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343","startPage":"211","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TESTTUBE: a system for selective regression testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=296780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TESTTUBE: a system for selective regression testing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296780/","conferenceDate":"16-21 May 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4711523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TESTTUBE: a system for selective regression testing","confLoc":"Sorrento, Italy","sourcePdf":"00296780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073071S","chronDate":"16-21 May 1994","isNumber":"7343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"981","citationCount":"91","articleId":"296780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":296790,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

The mixer allows fast mixing of small amounts of two liquids and is applicable to microliquid handling systems. The mixer has a channel for the liquid, an inlet port for the reagent, a 2.2-mm*2-mm*330- mu m mixing area, and 400 micronozzles (15 mu m*15 mu m) through with a reagent is injected into the sample liquid. The resulting microplumes greatly increase the contact surface between the two liquids and hasten the speed of the mixing by diffusion. The fabrication process is extremely simple. The mixing is complete within a few seconds; a homogeneous state of mixing is reached in 1.2 s when the total volume injected is 0.5 mu l and the injection flow rate is 0.75 mu l/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.1993.296914","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/1052/7345/00296914.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.1993.296914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro mixer with fast diffusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=296914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296914/","displayDocTitle":"Micro mixer with fast diffusion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4710938","conferenceDate":"10-10 Feb. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro mixer with fast diffusion","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00296914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033184S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb 1993","isNumber":"7345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1052","citationCount":"56","articleId":"296914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":296943,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Next, mechanical characteristics of the moving parts, i.e., static and dynamic deflections of flat springs, are measured for very small loads and displacements.

Typical applications are the motorization of electronic watches or the positioning systems in instrumentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/296966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4705954","conferenceDate":"10-10 Feb. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid ultrasonic micromachined motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid ultrasonic micromachined motors","confLoc":"Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00296966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036141S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb 1993","isNumber":"7345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1052","citationCount":"20","articleId":"296966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":297059,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

All of the electron current is found to be supplied by impact ionization during the sustaining mode; the drain voltage is self-clamped at the sustaining voltage by electrons, owing to impact ionization. The sustaining voltage is considered to be a function of the p-n-p transistor part of the common-base current drain and the structure parameters, and it can be controlled by the carrier lifetime through the former.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPSD.1993.297105","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs","pdfPath":"/iel3/1073/7348/00297105.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"51","doi":"10.1109/ISPSD.1993.297105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical investigations on IGBT snubberless, self-clamped drain voltage switching-off operation under a large inductive load","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical investigations on IGBT snubberless, self-clamped drain voltage switching-off operation under a large inductive load","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4705912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297105/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical investigations on IGBT snubberless, self-clamped drain voltage switching-off operation under a large inductive load","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00297105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031764S","chronDate":"18-20 May 1993","isNumber":"7348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1073","citationCount":"12","articleId":"297105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297138,"authors":[{"name":"J.-L.

The high input impedance of the MOS gate allows the power device to be triggered with a very low photocurrent induced by light-emitting-diode illumination.

Some reproductions of natural organisms occur with 'failures' called mutations. A more systematic variation of the genetic material happens in sexual reproduction. Each parent contributes half of its genetic material to the offspring. This method of variation is called recombination. The offspring will be identical to the parents if the parents are genetically equal. Variation is necessary to allow selection to work. Selection in nature is very difficult to define precisely. The term was introduced by Darwin (1859) very informally. 'The preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection'. But how can an observer predict which are the favorable variations? The favorable variations are the variations which are preserved! The variations can only be judged after they have competed in the 'struggle for life'. Natural selection is no independent force of nature, it is the result of the competition of natural organisms for resources. In contrast, in the science of breeding the above problem does not exist. The selection is done by human breeders. Their strategies are based on the assumption that mating two individuals with high fitness more likely produces an offspring of high fitness than two randomly mating individuals.

The potential which parallel genetic algorithms offer over existing information processing techniques is enormous. Genetic algorithms are ideally suited to the processing, classification and control of very-large and varied data. There are a growing number of programming systems for implementation of genetic algorithms. They can be grouped in three major classes: application-oriented, algorithm-oriented and general programming systems. This paper briefly describes these three classes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Applications of Genetic Algorithms","pdfPath":"/iel5/1273/7373/00297618.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7373","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Applications of Genetic Algorithms","startPage":"1/1","endPage":"1/4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introduction to genetic algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"15 Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Introduction to genetic algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297618/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4695941","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2004","conferenceDate":" 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introduction to genetic algorithms","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00297618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068623S","chronDate":"15 Mar 1994","isNumber":"7373","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1273","citationCount":"13","articleId":"297618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":297688,"authors":[{"name":"Guangming Yin","affiliation":["Department Elektrotechniek, ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"lastName":"Guangming Yin","id":"37389177900"},{"name":"W.

These chips consist of regular arrangements of elementary units, called smart pixels. Light detection is made with vertical CMOS-BJT's connected in a Darlington structure. Pixel smartness is achieved by exploiting the cellular neural network paradigm, incorporating at each pixel location an analog computing cell which interacts with those of nearby pixels. We propose a current-mode implementation technique and give measurements from two 16 x 16 prototypes in a single-poly double-metal CMOS n-well 1.6-/spl mu/m technology. In addition to the sensory and processing circuitry, both chips incorporate light-adaptation circuitry for automatic contrast adjustment. They obtain smart-pixel densities up to 89 units/mm/sup 2/, with a power consumption down to 105 /spl mu/W/unit and image processing times below 2 /spl mu/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.297693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7375/00297693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.297693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7375","startPage":"895","endPage":"905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart-pixel cellular neural networks in analog current-mode CMOS technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart-pixel cellular neural networks in analog current-mode CMOS technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart-pixel cellular neural networks in analog current-mode CMOS technology","sourcePdf":"00297693.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111877S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"52","articleId":"297693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":297696,"authors":[{"name":"U.

This way the commonly used discrete LC tank resonator circuit for impedance matching can be omitted. An equivalent noise voltage density of 0.3 nV//spl radic/Hz at 500 kHz has been measured. Despite the occurrence of the kink effect and other abnormalities in MOS transistor characteristics at 4.2 K, during the tests no abnormal operation has been observed.

Most accurate filter circuits are designed in the switched-capacitor technique. The existing design techniques require, however, the on-chip generation of a higher voltage by means of a voltage multiplier. In this paper, a novel technique, derived from the standard switched-capacitor technique, is presented. It is called switched-opamp because it is based on the replacement of the critical switches with opamps which are turned on and off. This technique results in a true, very low voltage operation without the need for voltage multipliers. As an example, a second order lowpass switched-capacitor filter is implemented in the switched-opamp technique. This filter operates with only a 1.5 V power supply. It is realized in a 2.4-/spl mu/m CMOS process with V/sub T/=/spl plusmn/0.9 V. It has a measured total harmonic distortion of -60 dB for a signal swing of 600 mV/sub ptp/ and a powerdrain of only 110 /spl mu/W.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7375/00297698.pdf","startPage":"936","endPage":"942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.297698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.297698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched-opamp: an approach to realize full CMOS switched-capacitor circuits at very low power supply voltages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Low voltage","Power harmonic filters","CMOS analog integrated circuits","Switching circuits","Switches","CMOS process","Distortion measurement","Total harmonic distortion","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operational amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","switched capacitor networks","active filters","low-pass filters","analogue processing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched-opamp technique","CMOS switched-capacitor circuits","low power supply voltages","analog CMOS circuits","SC filter circuits","design technique","low voltage operation","second order lowpass SC filter","1 to 2 V","2.4 micron","110 muW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Switched-opamp: an approach to realize full CMOS switched-capacitor circuits at very low power supply voltages","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767239","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-opamp: an approach to realize full CMOS switched-capacitor circuits at very low power supply voltages","sourcePdf":"00297698.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098696S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"229","articleId":"297698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297699,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

Even though the device is designed to be used primarily in the output cards of programmable controllers, it is a general purpose device, since it can drive any kind of load (resistive, capacitive, or inductive) with an output current of 100 mA. The novel structure of the top driver allows full protection of the output stage against any kind of short circuits and/or overloads, providing a linear current limitation. Furthermore, when a channel is tristated, for every applied voltage ranging from ground to the supply voltage, virtually zero current is absorbed from the output. An innovative high efficiency central charge pump circuit has also been designed and implemented, making both a very wide supply voltage operation (6-50 V) and high switching frequency (up to 500 KHz) possible, The device can also be used as a receiver since the input voltage can swing from -10-50 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.297702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.297702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7375/00297702.pdf","startPage":"957","endPage":"962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A monolithic quad line driver for industrial applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A monolithic quad line driver for industrial applications","volume":"29","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767243","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297702/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A monolithic quad line driver for industrial applications","sourcePdf":"00297702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035932S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","articleId":"297702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":297704,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The offset insensitivity of the RSD Converter reduces the effect of several nonidealities proper to current copier cells. Moreover, the benefits resulting from the large tolerances inherent to the RSD algorithm and the pipelined architecture result in an improved conversion rate. Measurements on a first prototype give an integral nonlinearity error less than 0.8 LSB for 10-bit accuracy. Power dissipation is 20 mW and silicon area is 2.5 mm/sup 2/. The measured sampling rate is 550 kS/s. It is an improvement by a factor of twenty compared to known equivalent CMOS switched-current converters. It is nevertheless still well below the predicted conversion rate of 4.5 MHz, which should be obtained once this A/D converter is integrated into an analog front-end. Full compatibility with standard digital technologies makes this kind of converter attractive for low power, medium-fast converters with 10-bit accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.297705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/7375/00297705.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.297705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A 10-bit pipelined switched-current A/D converter","volume":"29","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4767245","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297705/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10-bit pipelined switched-current A/D converter","sourcePdf":"00297705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028665S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"34","articleId":"297705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":297706,"authors":[{"name":"B.G.

A maximum gain of 14.4 dB has been achieved for the fully reentrant configuration. Electron beam and noise measurements versus the degree of reentrancy have also been examined. Results from the nonreentrant amplifier performance have been directly compared with the MASK simulation code and good agreement has been obtained. These experiments will provide the basis for more detailed investigations on the effect of reentrancy on CFA operation and will also allow for the development of more accurate computer models of the reentrant system for numerical simulation of CFA operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.297743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7376/00297743.pdf","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1464","doi":"10.1109/16.297743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A circular crossed-field amplifier for in situ measurements, study of reentrant beam effects, and comparison with numerical simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A circular crossed-field amplifier for in situ measurements, study of reentrant beam effects, and comparison with numerical simulation","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4774256","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A circular crossed-field amplifier for in situ measurements, study of reentrant beam effects, and comparison with numerical simulation","sourcePdf":"00297743.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036789S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","articleId":"297743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":297751,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

These tools may not deal effectively with the physics of UHF and microwave electromagnetic wave energy transport along metal surfaces such as ground planes or in the air away from metal paths that are common at or above this frequency range. In this paper, we discuss full-wave modeling of electronic circuits in three dimensions using the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) solution of Maxwell's equations. Parameters such as stripline complex line impedance, propagation constant, capacitance per unit length and inductance per unit length can be easily computed as a function of frequency. We also discuss FD-TD Maxwell's equations computational modeling of lumped-circuit loads and sources in 3-D, including resistors and resistive voltage sources, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors. We believe that this approach will be useful in simulating the large-signal behavior of very high-speed nonlinear analog and digital devices in the context of the full-wave time-dependent electromagnetic field.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.297814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7379/00297814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.297814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7379","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FD-TD modeling of digital signal propagation in 3-D circuits with passive and active loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FD-TD modeling of digital signal propagation in 3-D circuits with passive and active loads","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761574","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FD-TD modeling of digital signal propagation in 3-D circuits with passive and active loads","sourcePdf":"00297814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029014S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"343","articleId":"297814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297819,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Jong Chung","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyh-Jong Chung","id":"37278469100"},{"name":"Jiunn-Lang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiunn-Lang Chen","id":"37384640100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"297819","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"A modified finite element method with new solving algorithm is proposed to analyze electromagnetic problems of finite periodic structures.

The new form of adaptive notch filter is useful for suppressing strong cochannel FM and CW signals and allows simple, practical realizations of very high and adaptive notch filters in either analog or digital technologies. The analysis demonstrates that when the instantaneous frequency of the stronger interfering FM carrier signal is known precisely, the stronger signal can be completely eliminated. In some cases, placing an additional adaptive notch filter in front of the stronger signal demodulator to suppress the weaker desired cochannel signal improves the estimate of the stronger signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.297845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7380","startPage":"2384","endPage":"2389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7380/00297845.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cochannel FM interference suppression using adaptive notch filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cochannel FM interference suppression using adaptive notch filters","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4752324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cochannel FM interference suppression using adaptive notch filters","sourcePdf":"00297845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030458S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","articleId":"297845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":297848,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The received signal over such a channel may have both a specular component and a scatter (Rayleigh-faded) component. If there is only a scatter component, the noncoherent receiver is optimal. If there is only a specular component, the optimal receiver is the coherent receiver. In general, the optimal receiver for a Rician channel depends on the strengths of the two signal components and the noise density, and the set of possible optimal receivers is infinite. We consider a system in which the noncoherent receiver and the coherent receiver are employed in a parallel configuration for a symbol-by-symbol demodulation of the received signal. Each sequence of transmitted symbols produces a sequence at the output of each of the parallel receivers. The task of identifying which of these received sequences is a more reliable reproduction of the transmitted sequence is the data verification problem. In this paper, we show that data verification can be accomplished by combining side information from the demodulators with a suitable error-control coding scheme. The resulting system is a universal receiver that provides good performance over the entire range of channel parameters. In particular, the universal receiver performs better than the traditional noncoherent receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.297848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.297848","startPage":"2395","endPage":"2404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/7380/00297848.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal receivers with side information from the demodulators: an example for nonselective Rician fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Universal receivers with side information from the demodulators: an example for nonselective Rician fading channels","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4752326","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297848/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal receivers with side information from the demodulators: an example for nonselective Rician fading channels","sourcePdf":"00297848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03053S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","articleId":"297848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":297849,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan Kawas Kaleh","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications, Paris, France"],"lastName":"Ghassan Kawas Kaleh","id":"37352435800"},{"name":"R.

The effects of metrics conversion, quantization, and the presence of regenerative nodes on the system's cutoff rate performance are investigated. It is found that the conversion from an M-ary metric to a binary one suffers only negligible degradations. For communication links without regenerative nodes, as expected, the infinite-bit soft-decision is the optimal metric, followed by finite-bit soft decision and then hard-decision. For those with regenerative nodes, however, the infinite-bit soft-decision is outperformed by the hard-decision, but the finite-bit soft-decision decoder still keeps its edge over the latter. The issue concerning the order of metric conversion and diversity combining is also analyzed. Numerical results indicate that the conclusion obtained by an earlier simulation report addressing a similar design alternative in fading channels is valid for jammed binary channels, as well. That is, the precombining metric conversion technique gives up only minor performance degradations when compared to the more sophisticated postcombining metric conversion technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4752328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance of fast FH/MFSK signals in jammed binary channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of fast FH/MFSK signals in jammed binary channels","sourcePdf":"00297850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099373S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","articleId":"297850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":297853,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The approximation is based on Courtois' (1977) decomposition/aggregation techniques and is applied to Senet hybrid multiplexing, movable boundary frame allocation schemes. The approximation is applied to both infinite and finite buffer systems. In the former case the approximation is valid only in the underload region and serves as an upper bound for the mean data queuing delay. In the finite buffer case it is valid for the whole data traffic range and is shown to improve as the number of channels increase, and deteriorates as the buffer size increases. For finite buffer systems upper and lower bounds for the decomposition approximation have also been derived.

Recently one such scheme, an optical orthogonal code division multiple-access system (OOCDMA), was introduced by Salehi et al. (1982) for the case of no noise. In this paper, some extensions of that work are presented, including the effects of avalanche photodiode (APD) noise and thermal noise as well as interference for the OOCDMA direct-detection receiver. Since it has been shown that an optical hard-limiter before the receiver correlator can reduce the interference effect for the OOCDMA system in the absence of noise, the hard-limiter role in the presence of thermal and APD noise is also examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297857/","volume":"42","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4752334","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical orthogonal code-division multiple-access system .I.

However, it has been considered less effective for nanometer-sized particles such as biological macromolecules where DEP effects may be overwhelmed by Brownian motion. Here, the authors use the fluid integrated circuit (FIC) concept to fabricate micrometer-sized electrodes, with which a very high-intensity, steady-state, high-frequency field, over 1/spl times/10/sup 6/ V/m at 1 kHz to 10 MHz, is created. The observation of molecular DEP using avidin (68 kD) and other biopolymers is made, and it is found that DEP occurs at the field strength of 0.4-1.0/spl times/10/sup 6/ V/m, which is substantially lower than DEP theory predicts. As applications of molecular DEP, a novel molecular patterning method and \"dielectrophoretic chromatography\" are proposed. In the latter, biopolymer solution is moved through a high-intensity field region created in a FIC, and the polymer is analyzed and/or separated by the difference in the DEP attraction.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.297897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.297897","endPage":"843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/7382/00297897.pdf","startPage":"835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Molecular dielectrophoresis of biopolymers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297897/","displayDocTitle":"Molecular dielectrophoresis of biopolymers","volume":"30","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4761809","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Molecular dielectrophoresis of biopolymers","sourcePdf":"00297897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040791S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1994","isNumber":"7382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"192","articleId":"297897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":297905,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The current vector control algorithm of an interior permanent magnet synchronous (IPM) motor for constant power operation over the base speed is proposed. As the available voltage controlling the armature current vector is small in the flux-weakening constant power region, the current vector sometimes becomes uncontrollable in transient operations because of the current regulator saturation. The high-performance current regulator is also proposed to improve the current responses in the flux-weakening region, which includes the decoupling current controller and the voltage command compensator.

This paper investigates the use of a five-level GTO voltage-sourced inverter for large induction motor drives. The advantages of such a drive are that single GTO thyristors may be used at each level, thereby avoiding the need for series connection of the thyristors. The thyristors are well protected from overvoltages by the clamping action of the DC supply capacitors. The disadvantages are that each DC level requires a separate supply, four in the case of the five-level inverter, and that the devices are not equally loaded. This paper reviews the basic operation of the five-level inverter and possible PWM voltage/frequency control techniques for the specific application of induction motor drives. The simulation results clearly show the unequal loading of the devices and the need for independent voltage supplies for the five levels. It is shown that a combination of several PWM techniques offers the best solution for the drives application. The conclusions indicate that large induction motors with ratings up to 22 MVA, 7.46 kV may be supplied by the five-level inverter using available 4.5 kV, 3.0 kA GTO thyristors. The recommended supply for such an inverter with full regenerative operation over the complete speed range is four, four-quadrant converters in a quasi-24-pulse configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/7382/00297910.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Five-level GTO inverters for large induction motor drives","doi":"10.1109/28.297910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.297910","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Five-level GTO inverters for large induction motor drives","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4761822","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Five-level GTO inverters for large induction motor drives","sourcePdf":"00297910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044594S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1994","isNumber":"7382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"161","articleId":"297910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297916,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

This technique can be further expanded by applying AC capacitors in parallel with the load to lessen the burden of the PWM inverter.

Due to the poor convergence condition of the equation system, the convergence rate of solving this problem with iterative method is very slow. To improve this condition, a multiresolution basis transfer scheme based on the wavelet transform is proposed. By applying the wavelet transform, the original interpolation basis is transformed into two sets of bases with larger supports while the admissible solution space remains unchanged. With this basis transfer, a new set of nodal variables results and an equivalent equation system with better convergence condition can be solved. The basis transfer can be easily implemented by using an QMF matrix pair associated with the chosen interpolation basis. The consequence of the basis transfer scheme can be regarded as a preconditioner to the subsequent iterative computation method. The effect of the transfer is that the interpolated surface is decomposed into its low-frequency and high-frequency portions in the frequency domain. It has been indicated that the convergence rate of the interpolated surface is dominated by the low-frequency portion. With this frequency domain decomposition, the low-frequency portion of the interpolated surface can be emphasized. As compared with other acceleration methods, this basis transfer scheme provides a more systematical approach for fast surface interpolation. The easy implementation and high flexibility of the proposed algorithm also make it applicable to various regularization problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7384/00297948.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.297948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.297948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast surface interpolation using multiresolution wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Interpolation","Wavelet transforms","Equations","Convergence","Iterative methods","Frequency domain analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms","Matrix decomposition","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","convergence of numerical methods","wavelet transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface interpolation","multiresolution wavelet transform","large sparse linear equation system","convergence","multiresolution basis transfer scheme","interpolation basis","QMF matrix pair","preconditioner","frequency domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fast surface interpolation using multiresolution wavelet transform","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4742137","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast surface interpolation using multiresolution wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00297948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043282S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"45","articleId":"297948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297956,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

Position-orientation masking yields exactly one /spl theta/ value for each (x,y) that it considers to be the location of a possible occurrence of an object. Detailed matching of edge segments is performed at only these candidate (x,y,/spl theta/) to determine if objects actually do occur there. Template matching is accelerated dramatically since the candidates comprise only a small fraction of all (x,y,/spl theta/). Position-orientation masking eliminates the need for exhaustive search when deriving the candidate (x,y,/spl theta/). Search is guided by correlations between template vertices and distance transforms of image vertices. When a poor correlation is encountered at a particular position and orientation, nearby positions at that orientation and nearby orientations at that position are masked out. Position and orientation traversal are by quadrant and binary decomposition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.297956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384","startPage":"740","endPage":"747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/7384/00297956.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The position-orientation masking approach to parametric search for template matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"The position-orientation masking approach to parametric search for template matching","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4742144","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The position-orientation masking approach to parametric search for template matching","sourcePdf":"00297956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031037S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"22","articleId":"297956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":297973,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Craig","affiliation":["Division of Exploration & Mining, CSIRO, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Craig","id":"37386933800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"297973","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":316,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":789},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-volume transforms for remotely sensed data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297973","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Remote sensing","Clouds","Shape","Tail","Image enhancement","Distributed computing","Gaussian distribution","Australia","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","optical information processing","geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface geology","multispectral remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique","optical imaging","color colour","image processing","minimum volume transform","scatter diagram","darkpoint","nonorthogonal linear transformation","multivariate data","unmix images","spatial variables","land cover type","computer program","optical mapping"]}],"abstract":"Scatter diagrams for multispectral remote sensing data tend to be triangular, in the two-band case, pyramidal for three bands, and so on. They radiate away from the so-called darkpoint, which represents the scanner's response to an un-illuminated target. A minimum-volume transform may be described (provisionally) as a nonorthogonal linear transformation of the multivariate data to new axes passing through the dark point, with directions chosen such that they (for two bands), or the new coordinate planes (for three bands, etc.) embrace the data cloud as tightly as possible. The reason for the observed shapes of scatter diagrams is to be found in the theory of linear mixing at the subfootprint scale. Thus, suitably defined, minimum-volume transforms can often be used to unmix images into new spatial variables showing the proportions of the different cover types present, a type of enhancement that is not only intense, but physically meaningful. The present paper furnishes details for constructing computer programs to effect this operation. It will serve as a convenient technical source that may be referenced in subsequent, more profusely illustrated publications that address the intended application, the mapping of surface mineralogy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.297973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.297973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7385/00297973.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Minimum-volume transforms for remotely sensed data","volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4767699","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-volume transforms for remotely sensed data","sourcePdf":"00297973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033487S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"316","articleId":"297973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":297975,"authors":[{"name":"I.R.

The authors begin with the case in which scattering-matrix data are jointly Gaussian-distributed. The resulting copolar-phase PDF is formally identical to the phase PDF arising in the study of SAR interferometry, so the authors' results also apply in that setting. By direct simulation, they verify the closed-form PDF's. They show that estimation of signatures from averaged covariance matrices results in smaller biases and variances than averaging single-look signature estimates. They then generalize their derivation to certain cases in which backscattered intensities and amplitudes are K-distributed. They find in a range of circumstances that the PDF's of polarimetric signatures are unchanged from those derived in the Gaussian case. They verify this by direct simulation, and also examine a case that fails to satisfy an important assumption in their derivation. The forms of the signature distributions continue to describe data well in the latter case, but parameters in distributions fitted to (simulated) data differ from those used to generate the data. Finally, the authors examine samples of K-distributed polarimetric SAR data from Arctic sea ice and find that their theoretical distributions describe the data well with a plausible choice of parameters. This allows the authors to estimate the precision of polarimetric-signature estimates as a function of the number of SAR looks and other system parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7385/00297975.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.297975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.297975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probability density functions for multilook polarimetric signatures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Radar scattering","Sea ice","Covariance matrix","Interferometry","Remote sensing","Testing","Closed-form solution","Density functional theory","Backscatter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote sensing","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","oceanographic techniques","sea ice","polarimetry","geophysical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique","sea surface sea ice","ocean land surface terrain mapping","synthetic aperture radar","probability density function","polarization","multilook polarimetric signature","polarimetry","copolar","cross-polar ratio","copolar phase difference","K-distributed","covariance matrix","backscattering","SAR interferometry","Arctic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Probability density functions for multilook polarimetric signatures","volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4767701","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probability density functions for multilook polarimetric signatures","sourcePdf":"00297975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063808S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"79","articleId":"297975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297978,"authors":[{"name":"P.-Y.

The POLDER sensor is designed to collect global observations of polarized and directional solar radiation reflected by the Earth-atmosphere system for climate and global change studies. Aboard the ADEOS platform, the POLDER mission will provide near-daily coverage of the Earth at 6/spl times/7 km/sup 2/ resolution. The POLDER system will offer unprecedented opportunities to observe biophysical parameters over the oceans and land surfaces. The sensor's unique features, when compared to current and planned spaceborne instruments, include its ability to: 1) measure polarized reflectance in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions; 2) observe Earth target reflectance from 12 directions during a single satellite pass; and 3) operate in two dynamic modes in order to achieve both high signal to noise ratio and wide dynamic range. Six of POLDER's eight channels are optimized for observing atmospheric aerosols, clouds, ocean color, and land surfaces. The other two are centered on the H/sub 2/O and O/sub 2/ absorption bands for retrieving atmospheric water vapor amount and cloud top altitude, respectively. POLDER data will be subject to the high calibration standards defined by the POLDER mission team, with absolute calibration accuracies of 2% for the shorter wavelength channels (/spl lambda//spl les/565 nm) and 3% for the longer wavelengths. A 1% accuracy is the goal for the intercalibration between the spectral channels. The POLDER instrument aboard ADEOS will contribute significantly to climate-related research on aerosol cycling, cloud-radiation interactions, the Earth radiation budget, ocean primary productivity, and continental biosphere dynamics. POLDER mission's scientific objectives will be to: 1) map atmospheric aerosols, including their sources and transport, and study their influence on the Earth radiation budget; 2) assess cloud properties, namely their height, phase and type; 3) estimate total integrated water vapor amount; 4) improve Earth radiation budget estimates; 5) estimate chlorophyll-like pigment content in the ocean surface layer and its role in the carbon cycle; and 6) characterize land surface properties and vegetation cover.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.297978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7385/00297978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.297978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7385","startPage":"598","endPage":"615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The POLDER mission: instrument characteristics and scientific objectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The POLDER mission: instrument characteristics and scientific objectives","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4767705","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The POLDER mission: instrument characteristics and scientific objectives","sourcePdf":"00297978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124239S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"607","articleId":"297978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":297982,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

Current methods that employ the red (0.64 /spl mu/m) and the near-IR (0.84 /spl mu/m) regions are unsatisfactory in that the presence of aerosols in the scene distorts the apparent reflectance in the visible and near-IR ranges of the spectrum. The mid-IR spectral region is also sensitive to vegetation due to the absorption of liquid water in the foliage, but is not sensitive to the presence of most aerosols (except for dust). Therefore, mid-IR channels on the AVHRR and EOS-MODIS (e.g., the 3.75 /spl mu/m or the 3.95 /spl mu/m channels) have a unique potential for the remote sensing of dark, dense vegetation, particularly in the presence of biomass burning smoke or industrial/urban haze. The reflective part of the 3.75 /spl mu/m channel (/spl rho//sub 3.75/) is applied to images of the AVHRR over the eastern United States. This channel was found to be correlated to reflectance at 0.64 /spl mu/m (/spl rho//sub 0.64/), less sensitive to haze than the visible channel and superior to both the 0.64 /spl mu/m reflectance and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to determine forest pixels in an image. However, its application to monitor the seasonal evolution of vegetation is presently questionable. For the purpose of the remote sensing of aerosol over dark, dense vegetation, it is proposed that the dark, dense vegetation be determined from /spl rho//sub 3.75/<0.025. These findings may have further implications for other specific applications of the remote sensing of vegetation in hazy atmospheres.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of forests using mid-IR reflectance: an application for aerosol studies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.297984","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7385/00297984.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.297984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=297984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/297984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection of forests using mid-IR reflectance: an application for aerosol studies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4767711","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of forests using mid-IR reflectance: an application for aerosol studies","sourcePdf":"00297984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076354S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"225","articleId":"297984","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":297989,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Pritt","affiliation":["Loral Federal Systems-Gaithersburg, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Pritt","id":"37354679600"},{"name":"J.S.

The method is suited for land-use classification based on the fusion of remotely sensed images of the same scene captured at different dates from multiple sources. It incorporates a priori information about the likelihood of changes between the acquisition of the different images to be fused. A framework for the fusion of remotely sensed data based on a Bayesian formulation is presented. First, a simple fusion model is given, and then the basic model is extended to take into account the temporal attribute if the different data sources are acquired at different dates. The performance of the model is evaluated by fusing Landsat TM images and ERS-1-SAR images for land-use classification. The fusion model gives significant improvements in the classification error rates compared to the conventional single-source classifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298006/","volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761931","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multisource classification of remotely sensed data: fusion of Landsat TM and SAR images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisource classification of remotely sensed data: fusion of Landsat TM and SAR images","sourcePdf":"00298006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037686S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"184","articleId":"298006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":298007,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The authors describe a technique which simultaneously reduces the data dimensionality, suppresses undesired or interfering spectral signatures, and detects the presence of a spectral signature of interest. The basic concept is to project each pixel vector onto a subspace which is orthogonal to the undesired signatures. This operation is an optimal interference suppression process in the least squares sense. Once the interfering signatures have been nulled, projecting the residual onto the signature of interest maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio and results in a single component image that represents a classification for the signature of interest. The orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) operator can be extended to k-signatures of interest, thus reducing the dimensionality of k and classifying the hyperspectral image simultaneously. The approach is applicable to both spectrally pure as well as mixed pixels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.298007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.298007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7386/00298007.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification and dimensionality reduction: an orthogonal subspace projection approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification and dimensionality reduction: an orthogonal subspace projection approach","volume":"32","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761932","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298007/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image classification and dimensionality reduction: an orthogonal subspace projection approach","sourcePdf":"00298007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054171S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"996","articleId":"298007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":298008,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

In general, interpolation requires significant computation time, and leads to loss of image quality, especially in the complex image. The new chirp scaling algorithm avoids interpolation, yet performs range cell migration correction accurately. The algorithm requires only complex multiplies and Fourier transforms to implement, is inherently phase preserving, and is suitable for wide-swath, large-beamwidth, and large-squint applications. This paper describes the chirp scaling algorithm, summarizes simulation results, presents imagery processed with the algorithm, and reviews quantitative measures of its performance. Based on quantitative comparison, the chirp scaling algorithm provides image quality equal to or better than the precision range/Doppler processor. Over the range of parameters tested, image quality results approach the theoretical limit, as defined by the system bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"786","endPage":"799","doi":"10.1109/36.298008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.298008","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7386/00298008.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision SAR processing using chirp scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Precision SAR processing using chirp scaling","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761933","volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision SAR processing using chirp scaling","sourcePdf":"00298008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04134S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"620","articleId":"298008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298010,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

The authors present analyses of data collected by the synthetic aperture radar instrument on-board the ERS-1 satellite on successive orbits. Use of a single satellite in a nearly repeating orbit is attractive for reducing cost and spaceborne hardware complexity; also it permits inference of changes in the surface from the correlation properties of the radar echoes. The data have been reduced to correlation maps and digital elevation models. The correlation maps show that temporal correlation decreases significantly with time, but not necessarily at a constant well-defined rate, likely depending on environmental factors. When correlation among passes remains high, however, it is possible to form digital elevation models. Analyses of noise expected in ERS-1 interferometric data collected over Alaska and the southwestern United States indicate that maps with relative errors less than 5 m rms are possible in some regions. However, orbit uncertainties imply that tie points are required in order to reduce absolute height errors to a similar magnitude. The authors find that about 6 tie points per 40/spl times/40 km scene with 5 m rms or better height accuracy are needed to keep systematic map height errors below 5 m rms. The performance of the ERS-1 radar system for topographic applications, though useful for a variety of regional and local discipline studies, may be improved with respect to temporal decorrelation errors and absolute height acuity by modifying the orbit repeat period and incorporating precise orbit determination techniques. The resulting implementation will meet many, but not all, objectives of a global mapping mission.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7386/00298010.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.298010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.298010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of topographic maps derived from ERS-1 interferometric radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Orbits","Spaceborne radar","Digital elevation models","Surface topography","Satellites","Data analysis","Instruments","Costs","Hardware","Environmental factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topography (Earth)","cartography","geodesy","geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land surface","geodesy","topography","radar remote sensing","geophysical measurement technique","accuracy","ERS-1","SAR method","interferometric radar","mapping cartography","digital elevation model DEM","synthetic aperture radar","global mapping mission","satellite method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of topographic maps derived from ERS-1 interferometric radar","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of topographic maps derived from ERS-1 interferometric radar","sourcePdf":"00298010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055704S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"270","articleId":"298010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":298012,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

This technique requires an interferometric synthetic aperture radar system with at least two unique baselines along the direction of platform motion. The coherence time of the surface may be presented as a high-resolution coherence time map. This technique was tested using the JPL AIRSAR along-track interferometer. Measurements of the ocean coherence at the L-band were made at high spatial resolution under a variety of conditions. A new operating technique that results in the required two baselines is described. Some parametric analysis is performed pertaining to the design of such a system. A representative interferometric data set acquired at the Strait of Messina in 1991 is presented to illustrate the technique. The interferometric phase data reveal and measure tidal currents flowing through the strait, while the coherence time image shows considerable structure not visible in the backscatter or phase image. Coherence times in and around the strait were measured to be of the order of 0.1 s at the L-band, which is in agreement with previous estimates and measurements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating ocean coherence time using dual-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.298012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/7386/00298012.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.298012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Estimating ocean coherence time using dual-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4761937","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating ocean coherence time using dual-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar","sourcePdf":"00298012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037509S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"62","articleId":"298012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":298013,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Some complexity results have been obtained, and a number of heuristic algorithms have been proposed. For circuit networks that are restricted to the set of trees, or series-parallel graphs, pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to obtain the exact solution have also been proposed, though none can be extended to circuit networks that are arbitrary directed acyclic graphs (dags), We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard. Our result implies that for arbitrary dags, there is no pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to obtain the exact solution unless P=NP. We also prove that the absolute approximation discrete gate sizing problem is strongly NP-hard.

This delay test form is called \"broad-side\" since the second vector of the delay test pair is provided in a broad-side fashion, namely through the logic. This paper concentrates on several issues concerning broad-side delay test. It analyzes the effectiveness of broad-side delay test; shows how to compute broad-side delay test vectors; shows how to generate broad-side delay test vectors using existing tools that were aimed at stuck-at faults; shows how to compute the detection probability of a transition fault using broad-side pseudo-random patterns; shows the results of experiments conducted on the ISCAS sequential benchmarks; and discusses some concerns of the broad-side delay test strategy. It is shown that the broad-side method is inferior to the skewed-load method, which is another form of scan-based transition test. There is, however, a merit in combining the skewed-load method with the broad-side method. This combined method will achieve a higher transition fault coverage than each individual method alone.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298042/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4765830","volume":"13","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broad-side delay test","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broad-side delay test","sourcePdf":"00298042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036231S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"170","articleId":"298042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298051,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

The algorithm is an extension of the symbol-by-symbol detector of Abend and Fritchman, originally derived for intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, to the multiuser application. In order to make the multiuser detector adaptive, the likelihoods in the symbol-by-symbol metric update are approximated using a set of extended Kalman filter (EKF) innovations. The EKF's provide, in addition to the likelihoods, joint estimates of the signal delays and amplitudes. The resulting algorithm is quite complex, due to the large number of possible composite symbols corresponding to the multiple users. However, it is shown that the likelihood computations and EKF updates can be expressed it terms of a set of cross-correlation functions, which need only be computed for a subset of the possible symbols. The cross-correlator outputs are updated at the bit rate, and thus the EKF and metric update computations need be performed only at a function of the spread-spectrum chip rate. A metric pruning technique is proposed that further reduces the number of EKF delay/amplitude estimators required. Finally, an important sampling simulation strategy is used to obtain bit-error rate estimates for the adaptive multiuser detector.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298051","startPage":"774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298051","endPage":"785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive multiuser detector with joint amplitude and delay estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive multiuser detector with joint amplitude and delay estimation","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4760942","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive multiuser detector with joint amplitude and delay estimation","sourcePdf":"00298051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039315S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"52","articleId":"298051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298052,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is shown that such a US demodulator exists in general only for approximations to the true statistics of the modulator-input sequences of the interfering users. It is argued that approximating the interfering modulator-input sequences as independent, white Gaussian processes is the practical compromise between accuracy and simplicity in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. The US demodulator for this approximation is shown to consist of a kind of matrix whitening fitter followed by a kind of matched-filter for the user in question. It is further shown that this US demodulator can often be well approximated as the symbol-by-symbol demodulator that makes the linear minimum mean-squared error estimate of each modulator-input symbol for the user in question. Simulation results are presented to confirm the theory of US demodulation and to illustrate its practical utility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298052","startPage":"786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298052","endPage":"795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-separating demodulation for code-division multiple-access systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"User-separating demodulation for code-division multiple-access systems","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4760943","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-separating demodulation for code-division multiple-access systems","sourcePdf":"00298052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060775S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"58","articleId":"298052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298053,"authors":[{"name":"P.

So far, practical systems have used power control to overcome fading and near/far effects. Another approach, which has a fundamental potential in not only eliminating near/far effects but also in substantially raising the capacity, is multiuser detection and interference cancellation. Various optimal and suboptimal schemes have been investigated. Most of these schemes, however, get too complex even for relatively simple systems and rely on good channel estimates. For interference cancellation, estimation of channel parameters (viz. received amplitude and phase) is important. We analyze a simple successive interference cancellation scheme for coherent BPSK modulation, where the parameter estimation is done using the output of a linear correlator. We then extend the analysis for a noncoherent modulation scheme, namely M-ary orthogonal modulation. For the noncoherent case, the needed information on both the amplitude and phase is obtained from the correlator output. The performance of the IC scheme along with multipath diversity combining is studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298053.pdf","startPage":"796","endPage":"807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a simple successive interference cancellation scheme in a DS/CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a simple successive interference cancellation scheme in a DS/CDMA system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298053/","publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4760944","volume":"12","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a simple successive interference cancellation scheme in a DS/CDMA system","sourcePdf":"00298053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051308S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"743","articleId":"298053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":298054,"authors":[{"name":"Dao Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Dao Sheng Chen","id":"38254725200"},{"name":"S.

The receiver efficiently implements the decorrelating detector of Lupas and Verdu (1989) and can be adapted to incorporate decision feedback to further improve the detector performance. While the basic receiver design is presented for synchronous CDMA over AWGN channels, experimental evaluation of the receiver for the asynchronous case verifies its robustness for cases when the relative user delays are small compared to the symbol duration as in microcellular scenarios. An efficient decorrelating RAKE combiner for frequency-selective multipath channels is also proposed and analyzed. Performance evaluation of the detector via computer simulation scenarios is conducted in support of analytical results to substantiate its potential for real-time operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive multiuser receiver for CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.298054","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298054.pdf","startPage":"808","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive multiuser receiver for CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4760945","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive multiuser receiver for CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00298054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060994S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"87","articleId":"298054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298055,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Since multiple-access noise is the sum of many independent random processes, it is reasonable to approximate it by a Gaussian process of the same power spectral density. This leads to the criterion of maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, receivers that maximize SNR in a particular DS-CDMA system model under various constraints are proposed and analyzed. The method proposed here does not require locking and despreading multiple arriving CDMA signals. The maximization of SNR is compared with the minimization of probability of error, when the receiver is constrained to operate bit-by-bit, in the absence of knowledge of the other users' spreading codes, timing, and phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298055.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A noise-whitening approach to multiple access noise rejection .I.

Odd correlation properties of PN sequences should be designed as well as their even or periodic correlation properties so that the cochannel interference can be reduced as small as possible. Polyphase PN sequences with such good correlation properties can be derived from biphase PN sequences with a good aperiodic correlation property under a certain condition. Absolute values of odd and even correlation functions of these sequences are equal at each shift. The authors evaluated their peak correlations properties and bit error rate performance. Numerical evaluations show that the derived polyphase sequences have lower peaks of correlations and lower bit error rate than their original sequences.

The average variance of cross-correlations between sequences is used as a measure for sequence design. The authors search for sets of sequences that minimize the probability of symbol detection error, given that there is imperfect synchronization among the signals, that is, the signals are quasi-synchronous. Orthogonal sequences based on the Sylvester-type Hadamard matrices (Walsh functions) are shown to provide a significant improvement over the case where a Hadamard (orthogonal) matrix is chosen at random. Computer searches suggest that this set of codes is optimal with respect to the above measure. The issue of chip pulse shaping is investigated. Optimal pulses designed to minimize multiple-access interference in quasi-synchronous systems are obtained for various bandwidths and are shown to provide a large improvement over the raised cosine pulses. A multicarrier signaling scheme is introduced in order to reduce chip level synchronization offsets between the users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298058.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicarrier orthogonal CDMA signals for quasi-synchronous communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multicarrier orthogonal CDMA signals for quasi-synchronous communication systems","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4760949","volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicarrier orthogonal CDMA signals for quasi-synchronous communication systems","sourcePdf":"00298058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061809S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"161","articleId":"298058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298059,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Several selective fading channels are employed as examples to illustrate that the choice of the best chip rate depends upon the characteristics of the channel and the number of taps in the rake receiver. The tradeoff between the number of taps and the bit error probability is investigated for different chip rates.

The results presented show the relationship between channel and system parameters and the system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct sequence spread spectrum matched filter acquisition in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.298062","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298062.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","displayDocTitle":"Direct sequence spread spectrum matched filter acquisition in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4760952","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct sequence spread spectrum matched filter acquisition in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00298062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054713S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"83","articleId":"298062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":298064,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The system has been conceived to take account of such diverse services as low bit rate voice and quasi-broadband services at rates of up to 256 kb/s. Broadband services imply the use of the ATM transmission technique, and particular attention is paid to the mutual impact of CDMA and ATM. An efficient automatic repeat request technique is described which gives a suitably low overall error rate and a soft capacity limit.

Some attributes of CDMA which are important to indoor systems include desirable anti-multipath properties, the lack of a need for frequency management or assignment, coexistence with other systems and suitability for micro-cell and in-building systems. The anti-multipath feature turns out to be a key issue for indoor systems and derives from the property that a signal with path delay greater than one chip interval is treated much like an interfering user. The number of users that share the same spectrum, and still maintain an acceptable performance, is determined by the interference generated by the set of remaining users and leads to soft degradation as the number of users increases. This work describes and analyzes a model for the discrete-input continuous-output Gaussian multiple-access channel, that uses spread spectrum techniques. The notion of sum capacity is used to characterize the system performance. Bounds on the sum capacity of this essentially binary input, continuous output channel, where the variance of the output noise is dependent on the number of users present, are obtained. The users are noncooperative in that no common codebook or synchronization is assumed. A novel feature of the work is the use of the modeling of the activity of the user community as a birth-death process. An information theoretic approach is used and the sum capacity is then considered in light of the various regimes to determine the effect of this modeling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.298067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","startPage":"925","endPage":"937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity for a discrete-state code division multiple-access channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The capacity for a discrete-state code division multiple-access channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298067/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4760957","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity for a discrete-state code division multiple-access channel","sourcePdf":"00298067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063493S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","articleId":"298067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298068,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Power control, multipath diversity system bandwidth, and path loss exponent are seen to have a major impact on the capacity. The CDMA system considered uses convolutional codes, orthogonal signalling, multipath/antenna diversity with noncoherent combining, and fast closed-loop power control on the uplink (portable-to-base) direction. On the downlink (base-to-portable), convolutional codes, BPSK modulation with pilot-signal-assisted coherent reception, and multipath diversity are employed. Both fast and slow power control are considered for the downlink. The capacity of the CDMA system is evaluated in a multicell environment taking into account shadow fading, path loss, fast fading, and closed-loop power control. Fast power control on the downlink increases the capacity significantly. Capacity is also significantly impacted by the path loss exponent. Narrowband CDMA (system bandwidth of 1.25 MHz) requires artificial multipath generation on the downlink to achieve adequate capacity. For smaller path loss exponents, which are more likely in microcellular environments, artificial multipath diversity of an order of as high as 4 may be needed. Wideband CDMA systems (10 MHz bandwidth) achieve greater efficiencies in terms of capacity per MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Bandwidth","Diversity reception","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Convolutional codes","Fading","Directive antennas","Binary phase shift keying","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","diversity reception","mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation","channel capacity","telecommunications control","power control","code division multiple access","convolutional codes","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity power control","bandwidth","microcellular CDMA systems","capacity","multipath diversity","path loss exponent","convolutional codes","orthogonal signalling","multipath/antenna diversity","noncoherent combining","uplink","downlink","BPSK modulation","pilot-signal-assisted coherent reception","shadow fading","path loss","fast fading","closed-loop power control","narrowband CDMA","multipath generation","wideband CDMA systems","10 MHz","1.25 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298069","doi":"10.1109/49.298069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/7388/00298069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.298069","startPage":"952","endPage":"961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of diversity power control, and bandwidth an the capacity of microcellular CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of diversity power control, and bandwidth an the capacity of microcellular CDMA systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4760959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of diversity power control, and bandwidth an the capacity of microcellular CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00298069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083419S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"83","articleId":"298069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":298070,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The advantages of this method, operating in Rayleigh fading channels are confirmed by theoretical analyses. The improvement is in order of 2/spl sim/3 dB at bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -3/. This method can be also effective against interferences from other users in a code division multiple access (CDMA) environment. The performance of this system in a CDMA environment is evaluated by theoretical analyses and is shown to be superior to non-combining method. At BER of 10/sup -3/ the required E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of the proposed system is 5 dB lower. If E/sub b//N/sub o/ is fixed, a greater number of users can be accommodated using the proposed system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298071/","volume":"12","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4760961","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Path diversity for FFH/PSK spread-spectrum communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path diversity for FFH/PSK spread-spectrum communication systems","sourcePdf":"00298071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050161S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","articleId":"298071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":298072,"authors":[{"name":"E.L.

Broadcast is a special case of multicast in which a message is delivered to all nodes in the network. The nCUBE-2, a wormhole-routed hypercube multicomputer, provides hardware support for broadcast and a restricted form of multicast in which the destinations form a subcube. However, the broadcast routing algorithm adopted in the nCUBE-2 is not deadlock-free. In this paper, four multicast wormhole routing strategies for 2-D mesh multicomputers are proposed and studied. All of the algorithms are shown to be deadlock-free. These are the first deadlock-free multicast wormhole routing algorithms ever proposed. A simulation study has been conducted that compares the performance of these multicast algorithms under dynamic network traffic conditions in a 2-D mesh. The results indicate that a dual-path routing algorithm offers performance advantages over tree-based, multipath, and fixed-path algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/7392/00298203.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"804","doi":"10.1109/71.298203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.298203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadlock-free multicast wormhole routing in 2-D mesh multicomputers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Deadlock-free multicast wormhole routing in 2-D mesh multicomputers","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4753539","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadlock-free multicast wormhole routing in 2-D mesh multicomputers","sourcePdf":"00298203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059965S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"190","articleId":"298203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298224,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Because the mutual information measures arbitrary dependencies between random variables, it is suitable for assessing the \"information content\" of features in complex classification tasks, where methods bases on linear relations (like the correlation) are prone to mistakes. The fact that the mutual information is independent of the coordinates chosen permits a robust estimation. Nonetheless, the use of the mutual information for tasks characterized by high input dimensionality requires suitable approximations because of the prohibitive demands on computation and samples. An algorithm is proposed that is based on a \"greedy\" selection of the features and that takes both the mutual information with respect to the output class and with respect to the already-selected features into account. Finally the results of a series of experiments are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.298224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7393/00298224.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.298224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using mutual information for selecting features in supervised neural net learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Using mutual information for selecting features in supervised neural net learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298224/","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4753528","pubMedId":"18267827","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using mutual information for selecting features in supervised neural net learning","sourcePdf":"00298224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033629S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1486","articleId":"298224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":298225,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Finally, applications of the proposed RBFNN to the state estimation of highly nonlinear systems are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7393/00298229.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.298229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.298229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radial basis function neural network for approximation and estimation of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Stochastic processes","Least squares approximation","State estimation","Nonlinear equations","Stochastic systems","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Filters","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","state estimation","nonlinear systems","stochastic systems","filtering and prediction theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network","nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems","state estimation","dynamic equations","static equations","nonparametric approximate model","suboptimal filter","upper bound error","approximation error","linear output equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Radial basis function neural network for approximation and estimation of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4753532","pubMedId":"18267832","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis function neural network for approximation and estimation of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems","sourcePdf":"00298229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039222S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"265","articleId":"298229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298231,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We extend previously known results regarding the effects of delays on stability and convergence properties. We treat in detail the case of ring networks for which we derive simple conditions for oscillating behavior and several formulas to predict the regions of bifurcation, the periods of the limit cycles and the phases of the different neurons. These results in turn can readily be applied to more complex and more biologically motivated architectures, such as layered networks. In general, the main result is that delays tend to increase the period of oscillations and broaden the spectrum of possible frequencies, in a quantifiable way. Simulations show that the theoretically predicted values are in excellent agreement with the numerically observed behavior. Adaptable delays are then proposed as one additional mechanism through which neural systems could tailor their own dynamics. Accordingly, we derive recurrent backpropagation learning formulas for the adjustment of delays and other parameters in networks with delayed interactions and discuss some possible applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How delays affect neural dynamics and learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.298231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7393/00298231.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.298231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"How delays affect neural dynamics and learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4753534","pubMedId":"18267834","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How delays affect neural dynamics and learning","sourcePdf":"00298231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049754S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"345","articleId":"298231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298232,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yih Ting","affiliation":["Center for Information Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Pei-Yih Ting","id":"37087314154"},{"name":"R.A.

The Gibbs sampler for a discrete solution space (or Boltzmann machine) can be used to solve both deterministic and probabilistic assignment (association) problems. The primary drawback to the use of a Boltzmann machine for optimization is its computational complexity, since updating of the neurons is typically performed sequentially. We first consider the diffusion equation emulation of a Boltzmann machine introduced by Roysam and Miller (1991), which employs a parallel network of nonlinear amplifiers. It is shown that an analog circuit implementation of the diffusion equation requires a complex neural structure incorporating matched nonlinear feedback amplifiers and current multipliers. We introduce a simpler implementation of the Boltzmann machine, using a \"constant gradient\" diffusion equation, which eliminates the need for a matched feedback amplifier. The performance of the Roysam and Miller network and the new constant gradient (CG) network is compared using simulations for the multiple-neuron case, and integration of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a single neuron. Based on the simulation results, heuristic criteria for establishing the diffusion equation boundaries, and neuron sigmoidal gain are obtained. The final CG analog circuit is suitable for VLSI implementation, and hence may offer rapid convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4757644","pubMedId":"18267835","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion network architectures for implementation of Gibbs samplers with applications to assignment problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion network architectures for implementation of Gibbs samplers with applications to assignment problems","sourcePdf":"00298232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051065S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"13","articleId":"298232","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":298233,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.T.

This paper describes application of neural networks to two problems, admission control and switch control, which exploit the adaptivity and speed property, respectively. The admission control problem is the selective admission of a set of calls from a number of inhomogeneous call classes, which may have widely differing characteristics as to their rate and variability of traffic, onto a network. It is usually unknown in advance which combinations of calls can be simultaneously accepted so as to ensure satisfactory performance. The approach adopted is that key network performance parameters are observed while carrying various combinations of calls, and their relationship is learned by a neural network structure. The network model chosen has the ability to interpolate or extrapolate from the past results and the ability to adapt to new and changing conditions. The switch control problem is the service policy used by a switch controller in transmitting packets. In a crossbar switch with input queueing, significant loss of throughput can occur when head-of-line service order is employed. A solution can be based on an algorithm which maximizes throughput. However since this solution is typically required in less than one microsecond, software implementation policy is infeasible. We will carry out an analysis of the benefits of such a policy, describe some existing proposed schemes for its implementation, and propose a further scheme that provides this submicrosecond optimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.298233","startPage":"639","endPage":"650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.298233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/7393/00298233.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network control of communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298233/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of communications systems","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4757645","pubMedId":"18267836","publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of communications systems","sourcePdf":"00298233.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040021S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"41","articleId":"298233","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298234,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The technique is applied to recover a network when some faulty links and/or neurons occur during the operation. If some input links of a specific neuron are detected faulty, their weights will be shifted to healthy links of the same neuron. On the other hand, if a faulty neuron is encountered, then we can treat it as a special case of faulty links by considering all the output links of that neuron to be faulty. The aim of this technique is to recover the network in a short time without any retraining and hardware repair.

VCO's were designed at 4 and 10 GHz by implementing different active inductance values. A 29% frequency tuning range from 3.54 to 4.73 GHz was obtained for the 4-GHz design. The output power varied from -1.2 to -0.2 dBm, respectively-less than 1 dB variation over the tuning range. The phase noise is -70 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier. The new VCO topology can be implemented without the use of backside vias or microstrip-matching components and can be realized in a compact 1.0/spl times/0.7 mm/sup 2/ area. The variable active inductance VCO topology provides a compact, high performance alternative to the analog multi-vibrator oscillator circuit that generally has a smaller tuning capability and worse phase noise performance at microwave frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4769644","volume":"4","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel heterojunction bipolar transistor VCO using an active tunable inductance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel heterojunction bipolar transistor VCO using an active tunable inductance","sourcePdf":"00298251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099475S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"19","articleId":"298251","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":298269,"authors":[{"name":"PeiZong Lee","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Institute of Information Science, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"PeiZong Lee","id":"37289660500"},{"name":"Fang-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Institute of Information Science, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fang-Yu Huang","id":"37383031400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"298269","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":302},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Discrete transforms","Speech processing","Image processing","Data compression","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","parallel algorithms","discrete cosine transforms","speech analysis and processing","matrix algebra","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restructured recursive DCT algorithm","restructured recursive DST algorithms","discrete cosine transform","discrete sine transform","image processing","speech processing","telecommunication signal processing","data compression","feature extraction","image reconstruction","filtering","recursive properties","DCT coefficient matrix","2-D DCT","2-D DST","parallel algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the discrete sine transform (DST) have found wide applications in speech and image processing, as well as telecommunication signal processing for the purpose of data compression, feature extraction, image reconstruction, and filtering.

These algorithms are based on the threshold decomposition of real-valued signals introduced in this paper. With this method an N-length WOS filter can be implemented by thresholding the input signals at most N times independent of the accuracy used. Beside saving in computations, the proposed algorithms can be applied to process arbitrary real-valued signals directly. Performance characteristics of FWH filters in 1-D and 2-D signal restoration are investigated through computer simulations. We show that both in restoration of signals containing edges and in the case of heavy tailed nonGaussian noise, considerable improvement in performance can be achieved with FWH filters over WOS filters, Ll filters, and adaptive linear filters.

With this operator, Levinson and Schur algorithms for the stationary stochastic model in q-domain can easily be transformed into the delta domain. Then, same transformation, will be applied to the q-domain on-line Levinson and Schur type RLS algorithms to obtain the delta-domain counterparts. Their normalized versions as well as a systolic array architecture implementing the new delta Schur RLS algorithm are proposed. Extension to the equal length multichannel case is also given.

In the context of stochastic processes, the use of wavelet bases has not yet been fully investigated. We use compactly supported wavelets to obtain multiresolution representations of stochastic processes with paths in L/sup 2/ defined in the time domain. We derive the correlation structure of the discrete wavelet coefficients of a stochastic process and give new results on how and when to obtain strong decay in correlation along time as well as across scales. We study the relation between the wavelet representation of a stochastic process and multiresolution stochastic models on trees proposed by Basseville et al. (see IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol.38, p.766-784, Mar. 1992). We propose multiresolution stochastic models of the discrete wavelet coefficients as approximations to the original time process. These models are simple due to the strong decorrelation of the wavelet transform. Experiments show that these models significantly improve the approximation in comparison with the often used assumption that the wavelet coefficients are completely uncorrelated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet representations of stochastic processes and multiresolution stochastic models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.298272","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7395/00298272.pdf","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.298272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298272/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet representations of stochastic processes and multiresolution stochastic models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4757758","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet representations of stochastic processes and multiresolution stochastic models","sourcePdf":"00298272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053549S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","articleId":"298272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298276,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

One of the subsets is used for estimation of the model parameters and the remaining for validation of the model. Two proposed estimators for linear nested models are examined in detail and some of their properties derived. Optimal strategies for partitioning the data records into estimation and validation subsets are discussed and analytical comparisons with the information criterion A of Akaike (AIC) and the minimum description length (MDL) of Schwarz and Rissanen are carried out.

The primary focus is on consideration of random excitation of nonlinear systems and, thus, the approach makes extensive use of higher-order spectral analysis to determine the frequency-domain Volterra kernels, which correspond to linear, quadratic, and cubic transfer functions. Although the Volterra model is nonlinear in terms of its input, it is linear in terms of its unknown transfer functions. Thus, a least squares approach is used to determine the optimal (in a least squares sense) set of linear, quadratic, and cubic transfer functions. Of particular practical note, is the fact that the approach of this paper is valid for non-Gaussian, as well as Gaussian, random excitation. It may also be utilized for multitone inputs. The complexity of the problem addressed in this paper arises from two principal causes: (1) the necessity to work in a 3D frequency space to describe cubically nonlinear systems, and (2) the necessity to characterize the non-Gaussian random excitation by computing higher-order spectral moments up to sixth order. A detailed description of the approach used to determine the nonlinear transfer functions, including considerations necessary for digital implementation, is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.298282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7395/00298282.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.298282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of higher order spectral analysis to cubically nonlinear system identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of higher order spectral analysis to cubically nonlinear system identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298282/","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4757768","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of higher order spectral analysis to cubically nonlinear system identification","sourcePdf":"00298282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052864S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","articleId":"298282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298287,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This problem has its origin in the constrained minimization framework and has extensive applications in signal processing. We recast this problem into the NN framework by constructing an appropriate energy function which the NN minimizes. The NN is of feedback type with the neurons having sigmoidal activation function. The proposed approach is analyzed to characterize the nature of the minimizers:of the energy function. The main result is that \"the matrix W* is a minimizer of the energy function if and only if the columns of W* are the orthogonal eigenvectors with a given norm corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the given matrix\".

The basic idea is based on the principle that the output power of an optimized beamformer achieves a local maximum if the steering vector coincides with that of the desired signal. The proposed approach iteratively searches for the correct steering vector by maximizing the array mean output power using a first-order Taylor series approximation of the steering vector in terms of the steering errors. This method has the advantages of easy implementation and suffers no loss in the degrees of freedom for interference rejection. Furthermore, the method is independent of the choice of the phase center coordinate origin contrary to derivative constraint methods. Conditions for the existence of a solution using the proposed method are also established.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/7395/00298291.pdf","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.298291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.298291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to robust beamforming in the presence of steering vector errors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Sensor arrays","Power generation","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Interference constraints","Antenna arrays","Frequency","Taylor series","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","signal detection","series (mathematics)","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust beamforming","steering vector errors","array beamforming","carrier frequency errors","steering angle errors","output power","mean output power","first-order Taylor series approximation","interference rejection","phase center coordinate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to robust beamforming in the presence of steering vector errors","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4757776","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to robust beamforming in the presence of steering vector errors","sourcePdf":"00298291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055294S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","articleId":"298291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298293,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

The QAP is NP-hard and therefore no algorithms are known for solving the QAP in polynomial time. For this reason a variety of heuristic methods have been proposed for this problem. In order to evaluate heuristics, Palubetskis proposed an algorithm that generates QAPs with known optimal solution value. We show in this paper that given a Palubetskis instance (but not its optimal value) the corresponding optimal value can be determined via a linear program, polynomial in the input data, i.e., in polynomial time. This implies that problems generated by the Palubetskis method belong to a simple and degenerate subclass of QAPs and are therefore not appropriate for algorithm testing. The proof technique suggests moreover a new lower bound for Euclidean QAPs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.298362","startPage":"481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/7396/00298362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.298362","endPage":"484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadratic assignment problems generated with the Palubetskis algorithm are degenerate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Quadratic assignment problems generated with the Palubetskis algorithm are degenerate","volume":"41","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4743643","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadratic assignment problems generated with the Palubetskis algorithm are degenerate","sourcePdf":"00298362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056377S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"4","articleId":"298362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":298364,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With the exception of a lowpass filter and a 1-bit D/A, the proposed circuit is entirely digital, providing accurate control over the oscillation frequency and amplitude. At the core of the oscillator is a digital simulation of an LC-tank circuit consisting of two cascaded integrators. This arrangement guarantees oscillation by constraining the poles of the resonator to locations on the z-plane unit-circle, even in a finite-precision implementation. To minimize circuit complexity, the entire oscillator is operated at the oversampled rate, thereby eliminating the associated interpolation filter. Furthermore, the incorporation of a delta-sigma modulator inside the resonator loop leads to a very efficient implementation requiring only 4 multi-bit adders and a 2-input multiplexor. The desired analog signal may be recovered by lowpass filtering the 1-bit output of the delta-sigma modulator. Experiments performed thus far have indicated an effective dynamic range exceeding 80 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","volume":"41","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4769970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A high-quality analog oscillator using oversampling D/A conversion techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-quality analog oscillator using oversampling D/A conversion techniques","sourcePdf":"00298375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039085S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"67","articleId":"298375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298378,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed method involves two steps: biorthogonal wavelet transform of the image, and lattice vector quantization of wavelet coefficients. In order to obtain a compromise between minimum distortion and bit rate, we must truncate and scale the lattice suitably. To meet this goal, we need to know how many lattice points lie within the truncated area. We investigate the case of Laplacian sources where surfaces of equal probability are spheres for the L/sup 1/ metric (pyramids) for arbitrary lattices.

In this approach, the problem of model parameter estimation is formulated as a problem of parameter estimation from incomplete data, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to determine a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate. Previously, the use of the EM algorithm in this application has encountered difficulties since an analytical expression for the conditional expectations required in the EM procedure is generally unavailable, except for the simplest models. In this paper, two solutions are proposed to solve this problem: a Monte Carlo scheme and a scheme related to Besag's (1986) iterated conditional mode (ICM) method. Both schemes make use of Markov random-field modeling assumptions. Examples are provided to illustrate the implementation of the EM algorithm for several general classes of image models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4743636","pubMedId":"18291939","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood parameter estimation for unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00298395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045659S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"131","articleId":"298395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298396,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In particular, the authors study the synchronization of periodic routing messages, and offer guidelines on how to avoid inadvertent synchronization. Using simulations and analysis, they study the process of synchronization and show that the transition from unsynchronized to synchronized traffic is not one of gradual degradation but is instead a very abrupt 'phase transition': in general, the addition of a single router will convert a completely unsynchronized traffic stream into a completely synchronized one. They show that synchronization can be avoided by the addition of randomization to the traffic sources and quantify how much randomization is necessary. In addition, they argue that the inadvertent synchronization of periodic processes is likely to become an increasing problem in computer networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1994","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1994","accessionNumber":"4758138","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The synchronization of periodic routing messages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The synchronization of periodic routing messages","sourcePdf":"00298431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037583S","chronDate":"Apr 1994","isNumber":"7400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"131","articleId":"298431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298434,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Ju Chang","id":"37087143393"},{"name":"Tian-Tsair Su","affiliation":["Transmission Technology Laboratory, Telecommunication Laboratories, Ministry of Transporation and Communications, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tian-Tsair Su","id":"37087493218"},{"name":"Yueh-Yiing Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yueh-Yiing Chiang","id":"37087491923"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6692"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2566"}],"articleNumber":"298434","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Association for Computing Machinery","url":"http://www.acm.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Queueing analysis","Traffic control","Closed-form solution","Mobile communication","Laboratories","Force measurement","Telecommunication traffic","Channel allocation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","probability","telecommunication traffic","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cutoff priority","cellular radio system","finite queueing","reneging/dropping","handoff calls","blocking probabilities","total carried traffic","handoff area","signal-flow graphs","Mason's formula","average waiting times","optimal cutoff parameter","queue sizes"]}],"abstract":"Queueing of new or handoff calls can minimize blocking probabilities or increase total carried traffic.

The proposed four-layer FNN performs well when used to recognize shifted and distorted training patterns. When an input pattern is provided, the network first fuzzifies this pattern and then computes the similarities of this pattern to all of the learned patterns. The network then reaches a conclusion by selecting the learned pattern with the highest similarity and gives a nonfuzzy output. The 26 English alphabets and the 10 Arabic numerals, each represented by 16/spl times/16 pixels, were used as original training patterns. In the simulation experiments, the original 36 exemplar patterns were shifted in eight directions by 1 pixel (6.25% to 8.84%) and 2 pixels (12.5% to 17.68%). After the FNN has been trained by the 36 exemplar patterns, the FNN can recall all of the learned patterns with 100% recognition rate. It can also recognize patterns shifted by 1 pixel in eight directions with 100% recognition rate and patterns shifted by 2 pixels in eight directions with an average recognition rate of 92.01%. After the FNN has been trained by the 36 exemplar patterns and 72 shifted patterns, it can recognize patterns shifted by 1 pixel with 100% recognition rate and patterns shifted by 2 pixels with an average recognition rate of 98.61%. The authors have also tested the FNN with 10 kinds of distorted patterns for each of the 36 exemplars. The FNN can recognize all of the distorted patterns with 100% recognition rate. The proposed FNN can also be adapted for applications in some other pattern recognition problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/7401/00298447.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.298447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.298447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy neural network and its application to pattern recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Pattern recognition","Biological neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Humans","Nonlinear distortion","Character recognition","Neurons","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","four-layer feedforward fuzzy neural network","learning algorithm","distorted training patterns","shifted training patterns","input pattern","nonfuzzy output"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy neural network and its application to pattern recognition","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4744099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy neural network and its application to pattern recognition","sourcePdf":"00298447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050323S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"131","articleId":"298447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298449,"authors":[{"name":"Il Hong Suh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Il Hong Suh","id":"37086974346"},{"name":"Tae Won Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Won Kim","id":"37087217974"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"298449","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298449","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Cameras","Function approximation","Motion measurement","Computer vision","Jacobian matrices","Feedback control","Radial basis function networks","Visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","fuzzy set theory","feature extraction","function approximation","motion estimation","servomechanisms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy membership function","neural networks","visual servoing","robot","manipulators","nonlinear mapping","feature Jacobian","feature based visual feedback control","fuzzy neural interpolating network","function approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.298449","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/7401/00298449.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"203","endPage":"220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.298449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy membership function based neural networks with applications to the visual servoing of robot manipulators","abstract":"It is shown that there exists a nonlinear mapping which transforms image features and their changes to the desired camera motion without measuring of the relative distance between the camera and the object. This nonlinear mapping can eliminate several difficulties occurring in computing the inverse of the feature Jacobian as in the usual feature-based visual feedback control methods. Instead of analytically deriving the closed form of this mapping, a fuzzy membership function (FMF) based neural network incorporating a fuzzy-neural interpolating network is proposed to approximate the nonlinear mapping, where the structure of the FMF network is similar to that of radial basis function neural network which is known to be very effective in the function approximation. Several FMF networks are trained to be capable of tracking a moving object in the whole workspace along the line of sight. For an effective implementation of the proposed FMF network, an image feature selection process is investigated, and the required fuzzy membership functions are designed. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to show the validity of the proposed visual servoing method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4744101","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy membership function based neural networks with applications to the visual servoing of robot manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy membership function based neural networks with applications to the visual servoing of robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00298449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065921S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"43","articleId":"298449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":298450,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

The fuzzy model is based on a set of ARX models that are combined using a fuzzy inference mechanism. The controller is a discrete-time nonlinear decoupler, which is analyzed both for the adaptive and the fixed parameter cases. A detailed stability analysis is carried out, and the main result is that the closed loop is globally stable and robust with respect to unstructured uncertainty, which may include modeling error and disturbances. In addition, bounds on the asymptotic and transient performance are given. The main assumptions on the system and model are that they must not have strong nonminimum-phase effects, except time-delay, and the unstructured uncertainty must not be too large. A simulation example illustrates some of the properties of the modeling method and model based control structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/7401/00298450.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.298450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.298450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy model based control: stability, robustness, and performance issues","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Fuzzy control","Robust control","Fuzzy sets","Uncertainty","Nonlinear control systems","Fuzzy systems","MIMO","Inference mechanisms","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","adaptive control","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","inference mechanisms","uncertainty handling","stability","multivariable control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear controller","stability","MIMO dynamical systems","fuzzy model based control","robustness","fuzzy inference mechanism","discrete time nonlinear decoupler","parameter estimation","adaptive control","unstructured uncertainty","modeling error","transient performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy model based control: stability, robustness, and performance issues","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","accessionNumber":"4744102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy model based control: stability, robustness, and performance issues","sourcePdf":"00298450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080291S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"129","articleId":"298450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298452,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Liang Chen","id":"37087400919"},{"name":"Wen-Chih Chen","affiliation":["Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Chih Chen","id":"37087200399"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"298452","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298452","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Control systems","Optimal control","Fuzzy systems","Expert systems","Intelligent control","Piecewise linear techniques","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent control","neural nets","inference mechanisms","process control","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","piecewise-linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["piecewise linear fuzzy controller","membership functions","inference rules","Gaussian potential function network based controller","neural network","approximate control response","neutralization process","intelligent controllers","nonlinear chemical processes"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.298452","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/7401/00298452.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"235","endPage":"244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.298452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy controller design by using neural network techniques","abstract":"This paper investigates the relationship between the piecewise linear fuzzy controller (PLFC), in which the membership functions for fuzzy variables and the associated inference rules are all in piecewise linear forms, and a Gaussian potential function network based controller (GPFNC), in which the network output is a weighted summation of hidden responses from a series of Gaussian potential function units (GPFU's). Systematic procedures are proposed for transformation from a PLFC to its GPFNC counterpart, and vice versa. Based on these transformation principles, a series of systematic and feasible steps is presented for the design of an optimized PLFC (PLFC*) by using neural network techniques. In the design procedures, the simplified PLFC is used as the initial controller structure, then a GPFNC, which gives the approximate control response to the initially given PLFC, is found for further optimization. A neutralization process is used to demonstrate the feasibility and the potential applicability of these intelligent controllers on the regulation of highly nonlinear chemical processes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4744103","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy controller design by using neural network techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy controller design by using neural network techniques","sourcePdf":"00298452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039106S","chronDate":"Aug 1994","isNumber":"7401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"25","articleId":"298452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":298462,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The stereo correspondence is modeled as a cost minimization problem where the cost is the value of the matching function between the edge pixels along the same epipolar line. A multiple-constraint energy minimization neural network is implemented for this matching process. This algorithm integrates ordering and geometry constraints in addition to uniqueness, continuity, and epipolar line constraints into a neural network framework. The interconnections of the neural network are designed to favor the match selections that follow the ordering constraint. The uniqueness, continuity, epipolar line, and geometry constraints are achieved by exciting and inhibiting neurons, and by injecting external bias currents. The result from the neural network is the solution incorporating simultaneously all the above multiple constraints. Various complexity real images are tested to show the robustness. The algorithm is discussed in detail and experimental results using real images are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298519/","accessionNumber":"4710788","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stereo correspondence through multiple constraint neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo correspondence through multiple constraint neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038384S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"2","articleId":"298519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298520,"authors":[{"name":"C.-J.

The architecture is called the parallel consensual neural network, and its relation to hierarchical and ensemble neural networks is discussed. The parallel consensual neural network architecture is based on statistical consensus theory. The input data are transformed several times. The different transformed data are applied as if they were independent inputs, and are classified using stage neural networks. The outputs from the stage networks are weighted and combined to make a decision. Experimental results based on remote sensing data and geographic data are given. The performance of the consensual neural network architecture is compared to that of a two-layer (one hidden layer) conjugate-gradient backpropagation neural network.

The system has a decentralized configuration. All the robots cannot communicate globally at a time, but some robots can communicate locally and coordinate to avoid competition for a public resource. In such a system, it is difficult for each robot to plan its motion effectively while considering other robots, because the robots cannot predict motions of other robots as an unknown environment. Therefore, each robot only determines its motion selfishly for itself while considering a known environment. In the proposed approach, each robot plans its motion while considering the known environment and using empirical knowledge. The robot considers its unknown environment including other robots in the empirical knowledge. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimization of motion planning of each robot. Through iterations, each robot acquires knowledge empirically, using fuzzy logic.

In a state of minimum entropy, only one unit is turned on, while all the other units are turned off. Neurons selectively respond to specific patterns. These selective responses can also be described by using an entropy function. In a state of minimum entropy, a unit responds only to one specific pattern, while in a state of maximum entropy, the unit responds to all the patterns uniformly. Formulating two kinds of entropy function for the competition and selection, the method is applied to several problems. In all cases, it is confirmed that the entropy method enables units to compete with each other and could significantly improve the selectivity of units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298560","startPage":"219","endPage":"225 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298560.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum entropy methods in neural networks: competition and selective responses by entropy minimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298560/","displayDocTitle":"Minimum entropy methods in neural networks: competition and selective responses by entropy minimization","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4740299","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum entropy methods in neural networks: competition and selective responses by entropy minimization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03281S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"7","articleId":"298560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298561,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

Each hidden unit in the network is trained in closed form by means of a recursive least squares algorithm. A local covariance matrix of the data is maintained at each node, and the closed form solution is recursively updated. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated on a small-scale problem, using two-dimensional speech data.

The a posteriori probability can be expressed in a product form p(g/sub m/ mod x)p (c/sub k/ mod xg/sub m/). A classification scheme using a hierarchical ensemble of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) is proposed based on this idea. This architecture is shown to be equivalent, in principle, to a single-stage MLP classifier. The advantages of the hierarchical ensemble of classifiers become apparent in practice where the probability estimates are computed from a finite set of samples in a finite time with a particular algorithm. With respect to given performance criteria, such as classification accuracy over a disjoint test set, a hierarchical ensemble performs better than an equivalent single-stage classifier, given a limited amount of resources in terms of input data and learning time. Experiments on vowel classification using a hierarchical scheme show these advantages over a single-stage classifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298571","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298571.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"292 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical ensemble of neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical ensemble of neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4725490","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical ensemble of neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039887S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"4","articleId":"298571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298572,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The method, Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), is significantly better than magnitude-based methods and Optimal Brain Damage, which often remove the wrong weights. OBS, permits pruning of more weights than other methods (for the same error on the training set), and thus yields better generalization on test data.

A significance advantage of these neural networks over conventional approaches is their plasticity, which allows the networks to adapt themselves to new input data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298573","startPage":"300","endPage":"305 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298573.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant analysis neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298573/","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant analysis neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720586","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant analysis neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033822S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"29","articleId":"298573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298575,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

HB nodes that represent hyperboxes are generate to classify the training instances that cannot be classified by the hyperplane. The proposed model works well on both clustered and strip-distributed instances. The number of HB nodes generated depends on the overlapping degree of training instances. This classifier can classify continuous-valued and nonlinearly separable instances. Online learning is supplied, and the learning speed is very fast.

The capabilities of RPROP are shown in comparison to other adaptive techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298623","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298623.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"591 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: the RPROP algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: the RPROP algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298623/","publicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4715187","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: the RPROP algorithm","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042649S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"1825","articleId":"298623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":298626,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition to the learning of the a priori unknown input-output relation from target locations seen by the cameras to corresponding joint angles, the network provides the robot with the ability to perform feedback-guided corrective movements. This allows the positioning movement to be divided into an initial, open-loop controlled positioning and subsequent feedback-guided corrections.

The following triple-layered neural network is proposed: the first synapse is a one-shot associative memory using the modified Kohonen's adaptive learning algorithm with arbitrary input patterns; the second is Kosko's bidirectional associative memory consisting of orthogonal input/output basis vectors, such as Walsh series, satisfying the strict continuity condition; and the third is a simple one-shot associative memory with arbitrary output images. A mathematical framework based on the relationship between energy local minima and noise-free recall is established. The robust capacity conditions of this multi-layer associative memory are derived, which leads to forming the energy local minima at the exact training pairs. The proposed strategy maximizes the total number of stored images, and completely relaxes any code-dependent conditions of the learning pairs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298677","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"901","endPage":"907 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298677.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Associative memory","Magnesium compounds","Backpropagation","Sufficient conditions","Instruments","Noise robustness","Stability","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer associative neural nets","storage capacity","noise-free recall","triple-layered neural network","one-shot associative memory","modified Kohonen's adaptive learning algorithm","Kosko's bidirectional associative memory","orthogonal input/output basis vectors","Walsh series","strict continuity condition","energy local minima","exact training pairs","stored images","code-dependent conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer associative neural networks (MANN): storage capacity vs. noise-free recall","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298677/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4715218","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer associative neural networks (MANN): storage capacity vs. noise-free recall","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035233S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","articleId":"298677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":298679,"authors":[{"name":"H.W.

A modification to the learning dynamic is investigated using the notion of a terminal attractor, i.e., a stable equilibrium solution that is guaranteed to be reached in finite time. It is found that, even though in theory convergence to a terminal attractor can be achieved within a very short span of the resulting trajectory, computing the trajectory in practice often requires higher numerical accuracy (than the standard algorithm), and thus smaller steps are taken along the trajectory at each iteration. It is shown that comparable improvements in convergence can be obtained by a simpler and computationally less expensive variant of the standard backpropagation algorithm which incorporates a dynamically varying learning rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298682/","accessionNumber":"4715223","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the convergence of feedforward neural networks incoporating terminal attractors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the convergence of feedforward neural networks incoporating terminal attractors","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026942S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","articleId":"298682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":298684,"authors":[{"name":"Y.A.

The neural hierarchy forms part of a mathematical editor which uses handwriting as the principal means of man-machine interface. The symbols are considered as sequences of strokes which are in turn represented by a vector of the stroke curvature. An adaptive resonance theory (ART)-2 module is used for the unsupervised classification of the normalized strokes, while a recently proposed network is used for the acquisition of a spatial pattern. It efficiently represents the sequence of the eventually repeated strokes. An analog ARTMAP module is employed in order to classify the symbols and assign the appropriate code and name to them.

The partitioning uses the maximum entropy criterion, applied iteratively on selected subspaces to produce a hierarchical partitioning of the outcome space. The criterion for the selection of subspaces can be based on class-entropy value such that subspaces with high degrees of class discrimination power are generated.

The modified Boolean neural network implementation involves lesser hardware complexity, good noise immunity and faster circuitry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298711","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1103 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298711.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time solution for the traveling salesman problem using a Boolean neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298711/","displayDocTitle":"A real-time solution for the traveling salesman problem using a Boolean neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4720676","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time solution for the traveling salesman problem using a Boolean neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044629S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"1","articleId":"298711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298712,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A simple scheme of using simulated-annealing mutation (SAM) and recombination (SAR) as operators use the SA stochastic acceptance function internally to limit adverse moves. This is shown to solve two key problems in GA optimization, i.e., populations can be kept small, and hill-climbing in the later phase of the search is facilitated. The implementation of this algorithm within an existing GA environment is shown to be trivial, allowing the system to operate as pure SA (or iterated SA), pure GA, or in various hybrid modes. The performance of the algorithm is tested on various large-scale applications, including DeJong's functions, a 100-city traveling-salesman problem, and the optimization of weights in a feedforward neural network. The hybrid algorithm is seen to improve on pure GA in two ways, i.e., better solutions for a given number of evaluations, and more consistency over many runs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4720677","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and simulated annealing: a marriage proposal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and simulated annealing: a marriage proposal","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048129S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"53","articleId":"298712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298713,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The authors seek a technique to prevent premature convergence and refine the performance of GA for use in multivariable optimization and unsupervised learning of neural networks. An integer string representation for chromosomes is defined which is well fitted to this usage. The diversity of each locus and rareness of a chromosome are evaluated based on the distribution of alleles in a population. The fitness of a chromosome is adjusted with the rareness so that rare chromosomes will be likely to survive. Mutation width is introduced to adjust the effect of mutation which can generate rare chromosomes. By dynamically changing mutation width at each locus according to the diversity, prematurity can be avoided while conserving effective convergence. Case studies with problems of neural network pattern matching and unsupervised learning of a neural network which controls an inverted pendulum are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4720678","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Retaining diversity of genetic algorithms for multivariable optimization and neural network learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retaining diversity of genetic algorithms for multivariable optimization and neural network learning","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030947S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"5","articleId":"298713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298714,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

An overview of a decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF) algorithm for training of recurrent neural network architectures is presented, with special emphasis on application to control problems. Qualitative differences between the DEKF algorithm, which only performs updates to a recurrent network's weight parameters, and a recent EKF formulation of R.J. Williams (1992) that performs parallel estimation of both the network's weights and recurrent node outputs are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298726/","accessionNumber":"4725497","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Practical considerations for Kalman filter training of recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical considerations for Kalman filter training of recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034797S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"4","articleId":"298726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298727,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A large recurrent network in practice is very difficult to train. Constructive or destructive recurrent methods might offer a solution to this problem. It is proved that one current method, recurrent cascade correlation, has fundamental limitations in representation and thus in its learning capabilities. A preliminary approach to circumventing these limitations by devising a simple constructive training method that adds neurons during training while still preserving the powerful fully recurrent structure is given. Through simulations it is shown that such a method can learn many types of regular grammars which the recurrent cascade correlation method is unable to learn.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298727","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1201 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298727.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructive learning of recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298727/","displayDocTitle":"Constructive learning of recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4725498","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructive learning of recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060572S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"9","articleId":"298727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298734,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

In natural pattern recognition applications, the size of the training set is always limited, making the approximation task difficult. Invariance constraints can significantly simplify the task of density approximation. A technique is presented for learning invariant representations, based on a statistical approach to ground invariance. An iterative method is developed formally for computing the maximum likelihood estimate to the parameters of an invariant mixture model. The method can be interpreted as a competitive training strategy for a radial basis function (RBF) network.

A neural network, trained by backpropagation to mimic the behavior of a plant, is used to compute the squared error cost function for various candidates of controlling inputs. An optimal controlling input, by which the cost function will be minimized, is then numerically selected by, for instance, the simplex method.

The ideal is to store an image in a stable distribution of a stochastic neural network. Given an input image f epsilon F, one can find a SANN t epsilon T such that the equilibrium distribution of this SANN is the given image f. Therefore, the input image, f, is encoded into a specification of a SANN, t. This mapping from F (image space) to T (parameter space of SANN) defines the SANN transformation. It is shown that the compression ratio R of the SANN transformation is R=O(n/(K (log n)/sup 2/)) where n is the number of pixels. To complete a SANN transformation, SANN equations must be solved. Two SANN equations are presented. The solution of SANN is briefly discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298788/","accessionNumber":"4725534","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using stochastic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using stochastic neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057026S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","articleId":"298788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":298793,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is motivated by the human reading process in which a low resolution is used to effectively process the majority of clean and unambiguous text, while a more complicated recognition scheme is invoked only when a high resolution is needed. Compared with the method that utilizes single resolution, the multiresolution system not only speeds up recognition by up to 20 times, but also improves accuracy of isolated character recognition from 99.8% to 99.9%. The multiresolution approach captures the essence of better reading, and provides the building blocks for the next-generation OCR systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298793","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298793.pdf","startPage":"1588","endPage":"1593 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution neural networks for omnifont character recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution neural networks for omnifont character recognition","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4725539","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution neural networks for omnifont character recognition","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037981S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"5","articleId":"298793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298795,"authors":[{"name":"C.-A.

In the approach, two kinds of Hopfield neural networks are used. One is the analog Hopfield neural network, utilized to estimate the parameters of the finite point spread function (PSF) of a blurring system. The other one is the modified Hopfield neural network used to restore bilevel image. The entire model is based on the alternative operation of the two networks. In the modified Hopfield neural network, the eliminating highest error (EHE) criterion is applied for the purpose of obtaining a more precise solution. Simulation results show that, after a few iterations, the model always obtains a bilevel image whose quality is almost the same as, or even better than, what is obtained by the modified Hopfield network when the precise parameters of PSF are used. The results are quite good.

Some significant results of the authors' approach to train a neural network to perform this conversion are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298824/","accessionNumber":"4725570","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech synthesis with artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech synthesis with artificial neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298824.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028961S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"6","articleId":"298824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":298827,"authors":[{"name":"X.

In general, the dynamic system and the state observation channel are nonlinear, the cost function is non-quadratic, and process and observation noises are non-Gaussian. As the classical linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) assumptions are not verified, an approximate solution is sought by constraining control strategies to take on a fixed structure in which a certain number of parameters have to be optimized. Two nonlinear control structures are considered, i.e., radial basis functions (RBFs) and multilayer feedforward neural networks. The control structures are also shaped on the basis of the linear structure preserving principle (the LISP principle). The original functional problem is then reduced to a nonlinear programming one, which is solved by means of a gradient method. Simulation results related to non-LQG optimal control problems show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298839/","accessionNumber":"4725585","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radial basis functions and multilayer feedforward neural networks for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radial basis functions and multilayer feedforward neural networks for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038825S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"2","articleId":"298839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298840,"authors":[{"name":"S.-R.

The data of 30 failure patterns are experimentally collected using more than ten sensors. A fast Fourier transform (FET) is carried out on the time series of the sensor signals. The data of the magnitude spectrum, phase difference and others are used as the characteristic parameters in the failure diagnosis. Appropriate failure diagnosis information is extracted from the data. Similarities among the failure characteristics are established using fuzzy clustering and statistical analysis. The prototype consists of plural subnetworks and one specific sensor signal, and deals with the magnitude spectra from the sensor signal. The main network makes the final decision according to the output from the sub-networks and other data. The number of network connections can be reduced by approximately 40% without degradation of the recognition capability, in comparison with a conventional system where only one neural network is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298843/","accessionNumber":"4725589","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Failure diagnosis system on pneumatic control valves by neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure diagnosis system on pneumatic control valves by neural network","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060839S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","citationCount":"3","articleId":"298843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":298845,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This controller provides optimal routing of communication traffic requests on a call-by-call basis by rearranging existing connections with a minimum length of rearrangement sequence so that a new blocked call request can be accommodated. The proposed neural network controller uses Paull's rearrangement algorithm (1962), along with the special (least used) switch selection rule in order to minimize the length of rearrangement sequences. The functional behavior of the authors' model is verified by simulations, and it is shown that the convergence time required for finding an optimal solution is constant regardless of the switching network size. The performance is evaluated for random traffic with various traffic loads. Simulation results show that applying the least used switch selection rule increases the efficiency in switch rearrangements, reduces the network convergence time, and also keeps the network from being trapped in local minima. The implementation aspects are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1993.298846","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1901 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1059/7404/00298846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network controller for rearrangeable switching networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298846/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network controller for rearrangeable switching networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4730680","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network controller for rearrangeable switching networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00298846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038459S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"7404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1059","articleId":"298846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":298851,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

The operating principle, steady state analysis, input current and neutral point voltage control schemes, and detailed experimental results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298866","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298866.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","startPage":"771","endPage":"777 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force commutated three level boost type rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Force commutated three level boost type rectifier","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298866/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4710918","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force commutated three level boost type rectifier","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038453S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"60","articleId":"298866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298872,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

It is shown that additional insight into the operation and tracking ability of the conventional controllers is possible by treating them as special cases of the sliding mode based controller (SMBC) and applying sliding mode control theory. This is accomplished by resisting the HC and the RCC in terms of their operation inside and outside a boundary layer. In particular, it was shown that, with the proper choice of parameters, the SMBC and the RCC differ solely in their region of nominal operation. Whereas the RCC is typically operated within its boundary layer (linear region), the SMBC is designed for operation both inside (linear region) and outside (switched region) its boundary layer. A SMBC was developed with a performance that is superior to the conventional HC and RCC controllers. The transition between nonlinear and linear control is handled quite naturally by the SMBC. The current controller analysis is performed on a DC motor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298872","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298872.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"731 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to hysteretic and ramp-comparison current controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to hysteretic and ramp-comparison current controllers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4710912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298872/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to hysteretic and ramp-comparison current controllers","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037038S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"8","articleId":"298872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":298884,"authors":[{"name":"J.-R.

A complete analysis of both even phase and odd phase machines utilizing this control and circuit concept is presented. By using a five-phase or a seven-phase machine, it is possible to take advantage of the additional degrees of freedom as a result of more phases. It is shown that when one phase is open circuited, with appropriate control, the zero sequence current is no longer a necessary component as in a three-phase machine. That is, one can eliminate the need for a neutral line and the machine can still be controlled so as to produce a smooth nonpulsating torque. It has also been determined that the ratings of motor and inverter will both benefit by the use of extra phases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298884.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"644 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance free operation of a multiphase current regulated motor drive with an opened phase","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motor drives","AC motors","Circuits","Pulse width modulation inverters","Induction motors","Pulse width modulation converters","Induction motor drives","Torque control","Leg","Switching converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","electric drives","induction motors","invertors","machine control","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["even phase machines","multiphase current regulated motor drive","opened phase","induction motor control strategy","multiphase machine","disturbance free operation","odd phase machines","five-phase","seven-phase","zero sequence current","smooth nonpulsating torque","inverter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance free operation of a multiphase current regulated motor drive with an opened phase","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4710900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance free operation of a multiphase current regulated motor drive with an opened phase","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024112S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"23","articleId":"298884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298885,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This may entail loss or damage of material in such critical applications as the production of textile fibers on paper, or with extruder drives. The proposed solution to this problem is to recover some of the mechanical energy stored in the rotating masses. When a power interruption occurs, a sequence of fast feedforwarded commands is applied to force an immediate transition into the regeneration mode. During the interrupt interval, the drive system continues to operate at almost zero torque, just regenerating a minor amount of power to cover the electrical losses in the inverter. The method is implemented in an additional software package to be used with general-purpose inverter drives of limited dynamic performance.

A speed control system is established based on a DSP, and drive tests were carried out on a prototype IPM (interior permanent magnet) motor. The q-axis inductance of a IPM motor is found to vary depending on the q-axis current because of the magnetic saturation. The terminal voltage exceeds the maximum value in the flux-weakening region and, as a result, the transient responses sometimes become unstable because of saturation of the current regulator. The q-axis inductance is simply modeled as a function of the q-axis current and this compensated value of L/sub q/ is used in the control algorithm.

When PM motors are designed to operate in a wide temperature range, the reversible demagnetization of the neodymium magnets with temperature and the increase in winding resistance with temperature influence the maximum torque capability at rated speed and efficiency of the PM motor. The maximum torque at rated speed is limited due to the fixed DC link voltage of the inverter feeding the motor. It is shown that over an operating range of -40 degrees C to 150 degrees C the maximum torque capability and efficiency of the motor can vary over a wide range. It is also shown that for certain designs a nearly flat maximum torque versus temperature characteristics may be obtained.

Time domain analysis has been used to draw conclusions about the effects of changing the operating parameters of the power electronic controller on the vibration and acoustic noise. Experimental results have been obtained on a four-phase switched reluctance drive with one, two, or four phase excitation. The results of this time-domain study reveal important information which would not be apparent from frequency spectra. The results have been used to derive operational concepts for the power electronic controller to reduce the acoustic noise and vibration produced by the motor. Based on these results, a successful control technique has been developed. Using this control method, the vibration and acoustic noise can be dramatically reduced without affecting the performance of the drive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298911.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"113 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and reduction of vibration and acoustic noise in the switched reluctance drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic noise","Reluctance motors","Power electronics","Rotors","Production","Vibration control","Stator windings","Reluctance machines","Torque","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","exciters","machine control","machine testing","machine theory","noise abatement","reluctance motors","switching circuits","time-domain analysis","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine theory","machine testing","time domain analysis","vibration","acoustic noise","switched reluctance motor drive","operating parameters","power electronic controller","four-phase","excitation","control method","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and reduction of vibration and acoustic noise in the switched reluctance drive","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4715264","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and reduction of vibration and acoustic noise in the switched reluctance drive","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067738S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"45","articleId":"298911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298915,"authors":[{"name":"H.-Y.

The motor enables the energy stored in the magnetic field to be retained and utilized within the motor instead of being returned back to the source. The operating principles of the motor and associated power converters are presented. The analysis shows that, by employing both short pitch and full pitch windings, this new motor can eliminate the problems of current commutation and energy circulation without extra conductors in the slots. This motor has the following advantages over conventional VRMs: it allows a significant improvement in the turn-off process and therefore allows higher speed capacity than conventional VRMS; the machine has higher output because of the improvement of the turn-off performance and the utilization of the trapped energy. It can have higher output with the same converter or the same output with a smaller converter because of the improvement of the energy conversion ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298915","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298915","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","startPage":"137","endPage":"143 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A doubly salient doubly excited variable reluctance motor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A doubly salient doubly excited variable reluctance motor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298915/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4715268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A doubly salient doubly excited variable reluctance motor","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030317S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"2","articleId":"298915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":298919,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An analysis of the effects of position-varying loads on the current harmonic spectrum is presented. The load torque-induced harmonics are shown to be coincidental with rotor fault-induced harmonics when the load varies synchronously with the rotor position. Since the effect of the load and fault on a single stator current harmonic component is spatially dependent, the fault-induced portion cannot be separated from the load portion. Therefore, an online detection scheme which measures the spectrum of a single-phase current must rely on monitoring those spectral components which are not affected by the load torque oscillations. With this in mind, the detection of broken bars is still possible, since the current typically contains higher order harmonics than those induced by the load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.298943","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00298943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.298943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","startPage":"324","endPage":"330 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of time-varying loads on rotor fault detection in induction machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=298943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of time-varying loads on rotor fault detection in induction machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/298943/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4715292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of time-varying loads on rotor fault detection in induction machines","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00298943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042359S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"18","articleId":"298943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":298945,"authors":[{"name":"S.I.

A step voltage disturbance is applied across the stator terminals while the machine is in standstill condition, and the resulting stator voltage and current responses are measured. The initialization of the transfer function model parameters is achieved by the Laplace transformation of the recorded time-response data, and the maximum likelihood method is used for both the transfer function and the equivalent circuit model parameter estimation. Based on the identified models, simulation studies are performed and compared to the measured standstill time-domain response, the standstill frequency response, and the free acceleration response to validate the identified models.

The single-power converter is a dual active bridge DC-to-DC power converter (DABC), comprising high-frequency transformer-coupled input and output bridge converters. The DABC receives a rectified AC line voltage via a diode-bridge rectifier connected to a small, high-frequency filter capacitor. The two active bridges, generating edge-resonant square waves at their transformer terminals, appropriately phase-shifted from each other to simultaneously perform the high-efficiency DC output regulation while maintaining unity power factor at the AC input.

The potential variation is analyzed with the focus on the current flowing out of or into the neutral point of the DC link. The theoretical minimum capacity of the DC link capacitors is discussed for its application to both a vector-controlled induction motor system of 2.2 kW and a SVC system of 10 MVA, 6.6 kV, 60 Hz. It is shown that the proposed control scheme makes it possible to suppress the neutral-point potential variation within a few percent, so that the total capacity of the DC link capacitors in the NPC-VSI is almost the same as that in the conventional voltage source inverter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.299015","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00299015.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.299015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","startPage":"965","endPage":"970 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of variation of neutral point potential in neutral-point-clamped voltage source PWM inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of variation of neutral point potential in neutral-point-clamped voltage source PWM inverters","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299015/","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4720710","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of variation of neutral point potential in neutral-point-clamped voltage source PWM inverters","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00299015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040481S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"208","articleId":"299015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299023,"authors":[{"name":"J.-R.

The controller has good dynamic and steady-state response, and its performance is substantially immune to variations in the inverter DC supply voltage and motor parameters.

The HDDF is almost independent of the inverter operating conditions such as the switching frequencies or load parameters if the switching frequency is 40 times greater than the output frequency. Furthermore, it is closely related to the root mean square (RMS) values of the harmonic current and motor torque ripples for induction motor drives, or the RMS values of the harmonic current and DC voltage ripples for rectifier operation. Therefore, it is useful as a common quality index for the evaluation of PWM methods. Four typical analog PWM methods and four digital PWM methods are compared and evaluated based on HDDF values.

The self-excited induction generator used in SAWECS has the inherent problem of fluctuations in the magnitude and frequency of its terminal voltage with changes in wind velocity and load. To overcome this drawback the variable magnitude, variable frequency voltage at the generator terminals is rectified, and the DC power is transferred to the load through a PWM inverter. The objective is to track and extract maximum power to the local isolated load. This is achieved by using the FLC, which regulates the modulation index of the PWM inverter based on the input signals: the power error and its rate of change. The proposed FLC is simulated, and the results are experimentally verified on a scaled-down laboratory prototype of the SAWECS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rule-based fuzzy logic controller for a PWM inverter in a stand alone wind energy conversion scheme","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.299150","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00299150.pdf","startPage":"2066","endPage":"2073 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.299150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A rule-based fuzzy logic controller for a PWM inverter in a stand alone wind energy conversion scheme","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4730724","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rule-based fuzzy logic controller for a PWM inverter in a stand alone wind energy conversion scheme","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00299150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046744S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"7","articleId":"299150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299157,"authors":[{"name":"D.I.

In actual implementation, the distance difference between the desired path and the actual machined path, which is one of the most significant factors in the evaluation of control performance of industrial robots and CNC machine tools, is reduced in machining a circle with depth on the aluminum workpiece as the proposed learning algorithm repeats.

A neural network-based method for measuring the depth is proposed, since the depth cannot be directly measured in real time. The weld pool depth is estimated by using the information obtained from the welding side. The surface shape of the weld pool and the width of the groove gap can be measured during the welding. The weld pool depth can also be measured after the welding. Training data were constructed from these numerical data. When the width of the groove gap changes, the weld pool depth changes too. The feedforward control system for the variation of the groove gap width just under the electrode can be constructed by observing the groove gap width before the electrode. The feedback control system was constructed in order to keep the output of the neural network constant. The fuzzy control system was constructed from the feedback control part and the feedforward control part. The validity of a neuro-fuzzy controller was verified by welding experiments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1993.299169","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00299169.png","startPage":"2175","endPage":"2180 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1993.299169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1993 IEEE Industry Applications Conference Twenty-Eighth IAS Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel3/1090/7405/00299169.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network and fuzzy control of weld pool with welding robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299169/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network and fuzzy control of weld pool with welding robot","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4730737","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-8 Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network and fuzzy control of weld pool with welding robot","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00299169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029203S","chronDate":"2-8 Oct 1993","isNumber":"7405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1090","citationCount":"17","articleId":"299169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":299192,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

Genetic algorithms are search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. They combine survival of the fittest (amongst a population of) string structures with a structured yet randomised information exchange (between population members) to form a search algorithm with some of the innovative flair of human search. In every generation, a new set of artificial creatures (strings) is created using bits and pieces of the fittest of the old; an occasional new part is tried for good measure. The paper begins by describing the network model used and, briefly, both the underlying analysis method and the earlier heuristic optimisation methods. The basic principles of genetic algorithms are presented, and the details of the particular genetic algorithm used are described. The paper concludes with a comparison of the execution times and results obtained for an example network with those from Sinclair's heuristic method, and some suggestions for possible future work.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Tenth UK Teletraffic Symposium, 10th.

The results of these tasks are usually analyzed by a design team consisting of several members. Our goal is to depart from traditional single-user systems and build a low-cost scientific visualization environment that enables computer-supported cooperative work in the distributed setting. A synchronously conferenced collaborative visualization environment would let multiple users on a network of workstations and supercomputers share large data sets, simultaneously view visualizations of the data, and interact with multiple views while varying parameters. Such an environment would support collaboration in both the problem-solving phase and the review phase of design tasks. In this article we describe two distributed visualization algorithms and the facilities that enable collaborative visualization. These are all implemented on top of the distribution and collaboration mechanisms of an environment called Shastra, executing on a set of low-cost networked workstations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.299409","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/7409/00299409.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.299409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed and collaborative visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Distributed and collaborative visualization","volume":"27","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4760480","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed and collaborative visualization","sourcePdf":"00299409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036597S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"29","articleId":"299409","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299410,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Like message-passing machines, these multiprocessors have a distributed interconnection network and physically distributed main memory. However, they provide hardware support for efficient implicit communication through a shared address space, and they automatically exploit temporal locality by caching both local and remote data in a processor's hardware cache. In this article, we show that these architectural characteristics make it much easier to obtain very good speedups on the best known visualization algorithms. Simple and natural parallelizations work very well, the sequential implementations do not have to be fundamentally restructured, and the high degree of temporal locality obviates the need for explicit data distribution and communication management. We demonstrate our claims through parallel versions of three state-of-the-art algorithms: a recent hierarchical radiosity algorithm by Hanrahan et al. (1991), a parallelized ray-casting volume renderer by Levoy (1992), and an optimized ray-tracer by Spach and Pulleyblank (1992). We also discuss a new shear-warp volume rendering algorithm that provides the first demonstration of interactive frame rates for a 256/spl times/256/spl times/256 voxel data set on a general-purpose multiprocessor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.299410","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/7409/00299410.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.299410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel visualization algorithms: performance and architectural implications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","displayDocTitle":"Parallel visualization algorithms: performance and architectural implications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4760481","volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel visualization algorithms: performance and architectural implications","sourcePdf":"00299410.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02968S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"71","articleId":"299410","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":299413,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

These visualization packages help scientists see the internal workings of their algorithms and thus understand their computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.299413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.299413","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/7409/00299413.pdf","startPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive visualization of Earth and space science computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299413/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive visualization of Earth and space science computations","volume":"27","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4760483","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive visualization of Earth and space science computations","sourcePdf":"00299413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051222S","chronDate":"July  1994","isNumber":"7409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"41","articleId":"299413","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":299458,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our calculations of TE polarized gain, where the valence subband mixing and the heterobarrier leakage current are taken into account, are in good agreement with the experimental results. When a compressive strain of up to 0.5% is induced in the quantum wells, the density of states near the valence band edge is decreased, due to the reduction of heavy-hole and light-hole subband mixing. At the threshold condition, the compressive strain reduces not only the radiative recombination current, but also the hetero-barrier leakage current. Therefore, the threshold current is reduced, and its temperature dependence is found to be small, In the analysis, we also show that when larger compressive strain of more than 0.5% is induced in the 40-/spl Aring/-thick quantum wells, the threshold characteristics are degraded.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.299458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7410/00299458.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.299458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of GaInP/AlGaInP compressive strained multiple-quantum-well laser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of GaInP/AlGaInP compressive strained multiple-quantum-well laser","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4752277","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of GaInP/AlGaInP compressive strained multiple-quantum-well laser","sourcePdf":"00299458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080204S","chronDate":"Jun 1994","isNumber":"7410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"25","articleId":"299458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":299461,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

Due to the noncoincidence of the compound-cavity modes with possible frequencies of stationary lasing, such competition may cause self-locking of two compound-cavity modes with deep high-frequency oscillations of the laser output for a short (typically /spl les/5 mm) external cavity. Simple analytical expressions for critical feedback parameters and the frequencies of self-oscillations are given, as well as a generalized diagram of different dynamic regimes of a short external-cavity laser, which shows these regimes of high-frequency self-oscillations as well as coherence collapse instability.

However, if we represent the structure's energy transfer laws as a product of 2/spl times/2 scattering matrices then we can determine the reflection coefficients needed to produce a desired response using a recursive layer-peeling procedure that bypasses some tedious mathematics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.299500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.299500","endPage":"1680","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00299500.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/7411/00299500.pdf","startPage":"1671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multimirror structures for high-frequency bursts and codes of ultrashort pulses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299500/","displayDocTitle":"Design of multimirror structures for high-frequency bursts and codes of ultrashort pulses","volume":"30","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4756428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multimirror structures for high-frequency bursts and codes of ultrashort pulses","sourcePdf":"00299500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041776S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"8","articleId":"299500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":299559,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Edge vector finite elements are used to model the anisotropic and inhomogeneous interior, and a surface integral equation is used to model the unbounded exterior. Compared to other hybrid techniques, the approach here retains the symmetry and sparsity of the FEM matrix and introduces only one type of unknown equivalent current in the moment matrix equation.

FD-TD, which numerically solves Maxwell's time dependent curl equations, accounts for the complex geometrical and electrical characteristics associated with this antenna design and array implementation. Validations have been made relative to a moment method (MM) model of an electrically large linearly tapered slot antenna. Also, good correlation is shown to exist in the primary features of the antenna patterns between computed and measured data for all cases. This work has achieved a number firsts for the FD-TD methodology. It represents the first \"exact\" computational model of a single quad Vivaldi slot antenna; the first \"exact\" computational model of a phased array of Vivaldi quad elements; and the first FD-TD model to demonstrate grating lobes for a phased array antenna of any sort.

Performance analysis of the angle estimator is conducted, and a procedure is developed to construct the beamformers, which achieve the minimum estimation variance under Gaussian noise. It is shown that the optimum angle estimator using the maximum overlapping subarrays is efficient for a moderately high signal-noise ratio (SNR) and a small off-boresight angle.

The first problem is to decide the proper dimension of the required adaptive weight vector. Using the information of the array output power, we develop the detection formulas for the information theoretic criteria AIC and MDL to decide the proper dimension of the adaptive weight vector. If the input noise power is unknown a priori, efficient methods are proposed for estimating the input noise power in both cases, with and without the desired signal, to make the detection formulas still feasible. The second problem is to find the most appropriate channel signals for weight adaptation for efficiently canceling interference. An efficient method based on the maximum power reduction criterion is presented for selecting the most desired channel signals from the output of the signal blocking matrix. Theoretical analysis concerning the performance of the proposed methods is made. Computer simulations showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods are also provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.299567","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00299567.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7413/00299567.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.299567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"676","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of partially adaptive array beamformers based on information theoretic criteria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design of partially adaptive array beamformers based on information theoretic criteria","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299567/","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4747134","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of partially adaptive array beamformers based on information theoretic criteria","sourcePdf":"00299567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060264S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"9","articleId":"299567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":299574,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this formulation the fields reflected from the infinite ground plane are computed analytically, not as FDTD scattered fields. This is necessary to eliminate scattering from the edges of the ground plane, where it is terminated at the FDTD outer boundary. Also, the fields scattered by the ground plane are usually of much higher amplitude than the desired aperture-scattered fields. In this formulation these fields need not be absorbed by the FDTD outer boundary. This provides more accurate calculation of low amplitude scattering from the aperture. The formulation can include materials in the aperture and on both sides of the infinite ground plane. For example, scattering from an aperture antenna with a dielectric cover backed by an aperture filled with lossy dielectric can be computed with this formulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.299574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7413/00299574.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"736","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00299574.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.299574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering from apertures in infinite ground planes using FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299574/","displayDocTitle":"Scattering from apertures in infinite ground planes using FDTD","volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1994","accessionNumber":"4747141","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering from apertures in infinite ground planes using FDTD","sourcePdf":"00299574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046099S","chronDate":"May 1994","isNumber":"7413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"299574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299596,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Scattered fields are presented for several truncated planar geometries and are compared to three approximate solutions that use unperturbed two-dimensionally infinite Floquet currents, diffraction from a strip, and a physical optics solution for a strip, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.299596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7414/00299596.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.299596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299596/","displayDocTitle":"Edge effects of truncated periodic surfaces of thin wire elements","volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4752216","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge effects of truncated periodic surfaces of thin wire elements","sourcePdf":"00299596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048756S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","articleId":"299596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":299598,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

Analysis is by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The geometrical details of the antenna and the resistive loading along the antenna are chosen to optimize this antenna for pulse radiation. Theoretical results for the reflected voltage in the coaxial feed line and the time-varying radiated electric field are compared throughout with experimental measurements. The optimized, resistive bow-tie antenna is shown to radiate a pulse that more closely resembles that of the excitation than is radiated by a metallic bow tie of comparable size. Issues involving the use of the FDTD method for modeling fully three-dimensional antennas are also discussed. These issues include the use of a simple feed model and the staircasing of the edges of the antenna.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/7414/00299600.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.299600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.299600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of bow-tie antennas for pulse radiation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Loaded antennas","Time domain analysis","Dipole antennas","Antenna feeds","Coaxial components","Antenna measurements","Steady-state","Optimization methods","Antennas and propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","antenna radiation patterns","finite difference time-domain analysis","antenna feeders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bow-tie antennas","pulse radiation","reflected voltage","broad-bandwidth pulses","finite-difference time-domain","FDTD method","resistive loading","coaxial feed line","time-varying radiated electric field","three-dimensional antennas","staircasing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of bow-tie antennas for pulse radiation","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4752220","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of bow-tie antennas for pulse radiation","sourcePdf":"00299600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069564S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"127","articleId":"299600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299601,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Traditional statistical methods of aperiodic array synthesis fall far short of optimum configurations.

The genetic algorithm determines which elements are turned off in a periodic array to yield the lowest maximum relative sidelobe level.

The first method uses a least squares approximation for the computation of the pertinent integral operator and is referred to as LSD. A second implementation, referred to as Point Matching Discretisation (PMD) effects considerable saving in the computer time since it uses the midpoint rule for the integral arising in LSD. Both these techniques require O(N) storage, where N is the number of patches used to model the conductor. Further, a matrix interpretation of the present formulation has been derived. This has facilitated the comparison of the techniques described in this paper with the well known Method of Moments (MoM) formulation and has led to better understanding of the convergence of the results. Using illustrative examples of canonical (square and circular discs) and arbitrary shape (a pyramid mounted on a cube), the convergence of and the computer time for both the implementations have been investigated. It has been shown that both the techniques yielded monotonically convergent results for all the examples considered and that the LSD offers better estimate of the capacitance than PMD with lower number of patches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","volume":"42","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4752228","displayDocTitle":"Application of conjugate gradient method for static problems involving conductors of arbitrary shape","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of conjugate gradient method for static problems involving conductors of arbitrary shape","sourcePdf":"00299609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034052S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"3","articleId":"299609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299610,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

A typical requirement of existing algorithms is to assume that the zero structure at infinity and the high-frequency gain matrix are fully (or at least partially) known. It is well known that these requirements may be very restrictive, since, in general, both the zero structure at infinity and the high-frequency gain matrix depend on plant parameters. In this paper we show that these restrictive assumptions may be considerably weakened using Morse et al.'s hysteresis switching control strategy (1992). The strategy entails running a finite number of parameter estimators in parallel and using a switching algorithm to select between candidate estimators based on their associated prediction errors. Hysteresis in the switching algorithm precludes switching arbitrarily rapidly between estimators, and all switching ceases within a finite time. The results represent a significant step forward in understanding the minimal amount of prior knowledge necessary to design a stabilizing controller for a linear multivariable system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/7415/00299622.pdf","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.299622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.299622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hysteresis switching adaptive control of linear multivariable systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Adaptive control","MIMO","Parameter estimation","H infinity control","Control systems","Transfer functions","Industrial control","Drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable systems","model reference adaptive control systems","transfer functions","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hysteresis switching adaptive control","linear multivariable systems","model reference adaptive control","MRAC","deterministic continuous-time multivariable systems","square strictly proper minimum-phase transfer function matrices","zero structure","high-frequency gain matrix","parallel parameter estimation","prediction errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hysteresis switching adaptive control of linear multivariable systems","volume":"39","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747084","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hysteresis switching adaptive control of linear multivariable systems","sourcePdf":"00299622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081242S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"105","articleId":"299622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":299624,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The power-handling capability, thermal instability, junction temperature, and current distributions of HBTs with multiple emitter fingers have been numerically studied. The calculated results indicate that power HBTs on Si substrates (or with Si as the collector) have excellent potential power performance and reliability. The power-handling capability on Si is 3.5 and 2.7 times as large as that on GaAs and InP substrates, respectively. The peak junction temperature and temperature difference on the chip decrease in comparison to the commonly used Si homostructure power transistor with the same geometry and power dissipation. Thereby HBTs are promising for high-speed microwave and millimeter-wave applications. It has been also found that the nonuniform distribution of junction temperature and current can be greatly improved by a ballasting technique that uses unequal-valued emitter resistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7416/00299666.pdf","startPage":"854","endPage":"863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.299666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.299666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal design studies of high-power heterojunction bipolar transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Temperature distribution","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Current distribution","Fingers","Indium phosphide","Power transistors","Geometry","Power dissipation","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","current distribution","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","power transistors","semiconductor device models","solid-state microwave devices","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical study","microwave applications","nonuniform temperature distribution","unequal valued emitter resistors","high-power heterojunction bipolar transistors","thermoelectro-feedback model","thermal design","HBTs","power-handling capability","thermal instability","junction temperature","current distributions","multiple emitter fingers","reliability","millimeter-wave applications","ballasting technique","GaAlAs-GaAs","Si substrate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Thermal design studies of high-power heterojunction bipolar transistors","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3410064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal design studies of high-power heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00299666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077649S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"7416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"117","articleId":"299666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299669,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

The threshold voltage shift with the body bias at the front and back interfaces can be explained by the standard bulk body effect equation. However, the threshold voltage shift at the sidewall is smaller than predicted by this equation and saturates at large body biases. This anomalous behavior is explained by two-dimensional charge sharing between the sidewall and the front and back interfaces. An analytical model that accounts for this charge sharing by a simple trapezoidal approximation of the depletion regions and correctly predicts the sidewall threshold voltage shift and its saturation is discussed. The model makes it possible to measure the sidewall threshold even when it is larger than the front threshold voltage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and modeling of the sidewall threshold voltage of mesa-isolated SOI MOSFETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.299676","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/7416/00299676.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.299676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and modeling of the sidewall threshold voltage of mesa-isolated SOI MOSFETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3410073","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and modeling of the sidewall threshold voltage of mesa-isolated SOI MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00299676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040218S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"7416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"29","articleId":"299676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":299680,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A major drawback often associated with manifold designs is the potentially large number of network variables that must be handled simultaneously. The new multiplexer design approach being presented utilizes infinite-array prototype circuits based on logarithmic-periodic principles which, in turn, allow a significant reduction in the simultaneous-variable count. The technique is not confined to manifold architectures and can accommodate both contiguous and noncontiguous channels with a wide variety of frequency band allocations. The versatility of the approach is illustrated by two experimental contiguous-band five-channel multiplexer circuits that operate at C- and X-band frequencies, with one circuit designed for equal fractional bandwidths of 20%, and the other for constant absolute bandwidths of 800 MHz. These examples are believed to represent the first practical and successful utilizations of logarithmic periodicity in microwave multiport network design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.299727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.299727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7418","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7418/00299727.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Microwave theory and techniques","Frequency","Multiplexing","Prototypes","Bandwidth","Microwave circuits","Microwave filters","Radio spectrum management","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing equipment","frequency division multiplexing","multiport networks","microstrip components","distributed parameter networks","passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design methodology","microwave frequency multiplexers","infinite-array prototype circuits","manifold type","channel filters","logarithmic-periodic principles","contiguous channels","noncontiguous channels","C-band","X-band","microwave multiport network design","800 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient design methodology for microwave frequency multiplexers using infinite-array prototype circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299727/","volume":"42","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4747189","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design methodology for microwave frequency multiplexers using infinite-array prototype circuits","sourcePdf":"00299727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046406S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","articleId":"299727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":299729,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

First, a single filter element is characterized over the frequency range of interest by extracting lumped element values from the full-wave solution.

The filter response is then further refined by optimizing the full-wave response of the entire filter. This numerical technique exhibits excellent numerical convergence, with accuracy better that one percent with only 30 finite element nodes. Two filters were designed and their responses measured to verify the accuracy of the numerical technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.299737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/7418/00299737.pdf","startPage":"1407","endPage":"1411","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00299737.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.299737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-step waveguide E-plane filter design method using the semi-discrete finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299737/","displayDocTitle":"A 2-step waveguide E-plane filter design method using the semi-discrete finite element method","volume":"42","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1994","accessionNumber":"4747199","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-step waveguide E-plane filter design method using the semi-discrete finite element method","sourcePdf":"00299737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064342S","chronDate":"Jul 1994","isNumber":"7418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"3","articleId":"299737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":299745,"authors":[{"name":"Fujiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Kent, USA"],"lastName":"Fujiang Lin","id":"37087563388"},{"name":"G.

As an example of application, all parameters of a commonly used 15-element small-signal FET equivalent circuit model are clearly identified from only one set of measured S-parameters. A self-consistent generation of starting values can be involved regarding the FET in the passive pinch-off operating mode. Moreover, applying multi-bias data-fitting, which is performed without increasing the number of ordinary optimization variables, yields a robust determination of both the overall bias-independent parasitics and the bias-dependent intrinsic elements.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of reusable dosimeters which to-date has not been addressed in the published literature.

QML \"builds in\" the hardness of the product through statistical process control (SPC) of technology parameters relevant to the radiation response, test structure to integrated circuit (IC) correlations, and techniques for extrapolating laboratory test results to low-dose-rate space scenarios. Each of these elements is demonstrated and shown to be a cost-effective alternative to expensive end-of-line IC testing. Several examples of test structure-to-IC correlations are provided and recent work on complications arising from transistor scaling and geometry is discussed. The use of a 10-keV X-ray wafer-level test system to support SPC and establish \"process capability\" is illustrated and a comparison of 10-keV X-ray and Co/sup 60/ gamma irradiations is provided for a wide range of CMOS technologies. The X-ray tester is shown to be cost-effective and its use in lot acceptance/qualification is recommended. Finally, a comparison is provided between MIL-STD-883, Test Method 1019.4, which governs the testing of packaged semiconductor microcircuits in the DoD, and ESA/SCC Basic Specification No. 22900, Europe's Total Dose Steady-State Irradiation Test Method. Test Method 1019.4 focuses on conservative estimates of MOS hardness for space and tactical applications, while Basic Specification 22900 focuses on improved simulation of low-dose-rate space environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/7419/00299796.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.299796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.299796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=299796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced qualification techniques [microelectronics]","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Qualifications","Microelectronics","Circuit testing","Space technology","Integrated circuit testing","Semiconductor device testing","CMOS technology","Pulp manufacturing","Process control","Integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation hardening (electronics)","X-ray effects","gamma-ray effects","statistical process control","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","military equipment","packaging","quality control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Qualified Manufacturers List","commercial","military","microelectronics","radiation hardness","space applications","statistical process control","test structure to integrated circuit correlations","low-dose-rate","transistor scaling","transistor geometry","advanced qualification techniques","X-ray irradiation","gamma irradiation","CMOS","MIL-STD-883, Test Method 1019.4","ESA/SCC Basic Specification No. 22900"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1994","displayDocTitle":"Advanced qualification techniques [microelectronics]","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1994","accessionNumber":"4741951","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced qualification techniques [microelectronics]","sourcePdf":"00299796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043307S","chronDate":"June  1994","isNumber":"7419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"37","articleId":"299796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":299797,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

As we tend to need relatively broad bandwidths for such communication, the choice of carrier frequency would seem to be between the millimeter-wave/upper microwave bands and infra-red. The authors consider those systems which operate with one cell or multiple cells within a room. Such systems in the longer term must offer speeds compatible with fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) or the integrated broadband communications network (IBCN). Keeping this in mind, the authors look at the capability of systems supporting transmission rates of 100 Mb/s, though of course useful networks can be realized with much lower single user data transfer rates. As with mmw, infrared (IR) radiation is essentially restricted to the room in which it is generated; apart from leakage through windows and doors it will not normally be detected outside a room and should not interfere significantly with similar systems in neighboring offices. However, IR is not suitable for operation in very large rooms. In addition it is seen that mmw offers certain advantages in both large and small rooms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/299840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1994","publicationDate":"Aug. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4756512","volume":"32","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wireless LANs: physical properties of infra-red systems vs. mmw systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless LANs: physical properties of infra-red systems vs. mmw systems","sourcePdf":"00299840.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021883S","chronDate":"Aug.  1994","isNumber":"7420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"14","articleId":"299840","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":299842,"authors":[{"name":"Fuqin Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cleveland State University, USA"],"lastName":"Fuqin Xiong","id":"37301680100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"299842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Satellite communication","Communication switching","Baseband","Switches","Artificial satellites","Optical fiber cables","Communication industry","Optical fiber communication","Optical fiber polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modems","modulation","pulse modulation","phase modulation","signal detection","satellite relay systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite communications","modem techniques","current status"]}],"abstract":"Since the mid 1980s, research and development in satellite modem techniques has been very active and has yielded promising results.
